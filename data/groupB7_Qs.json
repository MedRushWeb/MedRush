  "explanation_2": "$This patient has #vesicoureteral reflux# (VUR), which is characterized by abnormal retrograde flow of urine into the ureter.  Most cases of VUR occur due to a congenitally #shortened intravesical ureter# (ie, the segment of ureter that passes through the bladder wall). $Contraction of the detrusor muscle during micturition not only increases pressure within the bladder, it also compresses the intravesical segment of the ureter, which maintains closure of the ureterovesical junction (UVJ).  If the intravesical ureter length is too short, the increased urine pressure may overcome the compression effect on the ureter, allowing #retrograde urine flow# (potentially causing bacterial ascent and febrile urinary tract infection [ie, pyelonephritis]). $The severity of VUR is variable based on the degree of ureter and kidney damage (eg, ureteral dilation, hydronephrosis, nephropathy).  Spontaneous resolution occurs in most patients with mild VUR, such as this patient, because the intravesical ureter length increases with patient growth. $(Choice B)  The rectovaginal septum is a fascial layer that separates the posterior wall of the vagina from the anterior wall of the rectum.  Damage to this area typically occurs during the birthing process, resulting in bowel (not bladder) dysfunction.$(Choice C)  Although renal stones may obstruct urine flow, they do not cause retrograde urine flow. $(Choice D)  @Posterior urethral valves@ occur due to abnormal development of the mesonephric (Wolffian) duct.  They can obstruct urine flow through the urethra; subsequent increase in intravesical pressure may cause reflux of urine into the ureter (ie, VUR).  However, VUR secondary to posterior urethral valves does not resolve spontaneously and almost exclusively occurs in boys. $Educational objective Vesicoureteral reflux typically occurs due to a congenitally shortened intravesical ureter length, which prevents complete closure of the ureterovesical junction and allows retrograde urine flow into the ureter during micturition.  Most cases resolve spontaneously as the length of the intravesical ureter increases with patient growth.",

  "explanation_2": "$This patient has urinary incontinence.  Continence is maintained by the bladder (detrusor muscle) and external and internal urinary sphincters.  The #external urinary sphincter# (EUS) is a skeletal muscle that receives somatic motor innervation (voluntary control) from the perineal branches of the #pudendal nerve# (S2-S4).  In contrast, the bladder and internal urethral sphincter (IUS) receive autonomic innervation: Sympathetic stimulation promotes urine storage and continence by increasing IUS tone and inhibiting detrusor contractions, and parasympathetic activity relaxes IUS tone and stimulates detrusor contractions, thereby promoting micturition. $ #Stress incontinence# is the leakage of urine with @increased intraabdominal pressure@ (eg, coughing).  A common cause is urethral sphincter dysfunction, which usually occurs in women with multiple #prior vaginal deliveries#.  Vaginal delivery is associated with obstetric trauma, which can cause urethral sphincter injury or pudendal nerve injury that contributes to decreased EUS tone.  Because of #low urethral sphincter tone# and increasing pelvic floor laxity with age, sudden increases in intraabdominal pressure (eg, coughing, sneezing) can cause the pressure within the bladder to exceed the urethral closing pressure.  This leads to #intermittent leakage# of urine. $#(Choices A, B, and D)#  Bladder outlet obstruction (eg, tumor obstructing the urethra) and detrusor muscle inactivity (often secondary to diabetic autonomic neuropathy) both lead to urinary retention.  In patients with urinary retention, urine slowly accumulates in the bladder until the intravesical pressure exceeds the urethral closing pressure, causing leakage.  Because urine is constantly accumulating in the bladder, patients have persistent involuntary dribbling of urine (overflow incontinence) rather than urine leakage with cough.  In addition, this patient's normal neurologic examination with no associated numbness or orthostatic hypotension makes diabetic autonomic neuropathy unlikely. $(Choice C)  Detrusor overactivity is the underlying mechanism of urge incontinence, which typically presents with a sudden urge to urinate followed by the immediate, involuntary loss of urine.  This patient's incontinence episodes typically follow an abrupt increase in intraabdominal pressure (eg, coughing, sneezing), making urge incontinence less likely. $ Educational objective Stress incontinence, involuntary leakage of urine with increased intraabdominal pressure, can occur due to urethral sphincter dysfunction (eg, decreased sphincter tone).  Risk factors include multiple prior vaginal deliveries, which can injure the external urethral sphincter or pudendal nerve.",

  "explanation_2": "$The #ureters# originate bilaterally at the renal pelvis and course inferiorly toward the bladder within the retroperitoneum just anterior to the psoas muscles.  Midway from the kidney to the pelvic inlet, the ureters cross posterior to the gonadal artery and vein.  The ureters then gain access to the pelvis by crossing anterior to the external iliac artery at, or just after, the bifurcation of the common iliac artery.  At this point, the ureter lies medial to the ovarian vessels and #anterior to the internal iliac artery#. $ Due to their course and proximity to other structures, the ureters are at particular risk for injury during pelvic and abdominal surgery. $(Choice A)  The ureters cross posterior to the gonadal vessels within the retroperitoneum before entering the pelvis.  In females, the ureters lie within the true pelvis medial to the ovarian vessels.  In males, the testicular vessels never enter the true pelvis; instead, they pass around the pelvic brim before entering the deep ring of the inguinal canal. $(Choice B)  The inferior vena cava rests on the right side of the vertebral bodies and is formed by the union of the common iliac veins at the L4 level.  The internal and external iliac veins join to form the common iliac veins at the pelvic inlet. $(Choice D)  The round ligaments of the uterus originate at the uterine fundus and course through the inguinal canal out to the labia majora.  The ureters do not lie in close proximity. $(Choice E)  The @uterine artery@ courses within the cardinal ligament to reach the uterus.  The ureters course along the uterosacral ligament and cross posterior to the uterine artery (water under the bridge) before entering the bladder. $Educational objective The ureters pass posterior to the ovarian (gonadal) vessels within the retroperitoneum and cross anterior to the common/external iliac arteries to reach the true pelvis.  Within the true pelvis, the ureters lie anterior to the internal iliac artery and posterior to the uterine artery.",

  "explanation_2": "$This patient's history of recurrent fever and abdominal pain with imaging findings consistent with renal scarring (eg. dilated calyces with overlying cortical atrophy) is indicative of #recurrent pyelonephritis#.  Pyelonephritis results from #retrograde flow# of bacteria in the bladder into the ureter, where they can then ascend unimpeded to the kidney. $Normally, the ureters travel through the bladder wall at an oblique angle.  When the bladder fills, the intramural ureter becomes compressed, and this flap-valve mechanism prevents retrograde flow of urine.  However, this mechanism does not work correctly if the ureter enters the bladder wall at a more perpendicular angle, leading to #vesicoureteral reflux# (VUR). $Patients with VUR are at much higher risk for chronic pyelonephritis.  Renal inflammation can occur from pyelonephritis and also from VUR itself due to increased hydrostatic pressure on the papillae.  Ongoing injury leads to #renal scarring#, most commonly at the upper and lower poles of the kidney in which compound papillae are found.  Compound papillae are always open, unlike simple papillae in the mid-kidney, and are therefore more susceptible to dilation and subsequent injury.  If uncorrected, chronic VUR can lead to reflux nephropathy and #secondary hypertension#. $#(Choice A)#  Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease generally presents in adulthood with hematuria, hypertension, and renal insufficiency.  Symptomatic patients have nephromegaly and diffuse parenchymal cysts on ultrasonography. $#(Choice B)#  Malignant hypertension refers to very high blood pressure that develops rapidly and causes end-organ damage.  Affected patients can have vision changes, encephalopathy, and renal failure.  This patient has no evidence of acute end-organ dysfunction, and her imaging is more consistent with VUR and chronic pyelonephritis. $#(Choice C)#  Multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) is a nonhereditary renal malformation characterized by multiple noncommunicating cysts with intervening dysplastic tissue.  Unilateral MCDK may be clinically silent, but bilateral MCDK presents with early, severe renal insufficiency due to the absence of functional renal tissue. $#(Choice D)#  @Posterior urethral valves@ can present with bilateral hydronephrosis and calyceal dilation due to obstruction of urine flow in the urethra.  However, posterior urethral valves result from a malformation of the wolffian duct and therefore only occur in male patients. $#Educational objective# Vesicoureteral reflux is characterized by retrograde urine flow from the bladder into the ureter.  Affected patients are at increased risk of chronic pyelonephritis and subsequent renal scarring (eg. dilated calyces with overlying cortical atrophy). ",

  "explanation_2": "This patient on long-term hemodialysis has carpal tunnel syndrome and shoulder pain/hypertrophy, most likely due to #dialysis-related amyloidosis# (DRA). $Amyloidosis is a group of multisystem disorders, all characterized by #misfolded proteins#.  Misfolding results from increased production, decreased clearance, inherited mutations, or age-related deposition of protein subunits.  Structural transformation of precursor proteins into #beta-pleated sheets# leads to aggregation and polymerization into amyloid fibrils.  Resistant to degradation, amyloid #accumulates in extracellular tissues#, causing organ dysfunction.  Each precursor protein generates specific amyloid fibrils predisposed to particular organs. $In DRA, #beta2-microglobulin# (beta2-m) is the precursor protein and a component of major histocompatibility class I molecules on all nucleated cells.  Continuously shed in plasma, beta2-m has near-total clearance by normal kidneys.  However, in end-stage renal failure, it is #inadequately eliminated despite dialysis# and deposited in tissue as beta2-m amyloid.  Disease most often involves #osteoarticular structures# as connective tissue components (eg, glycosaminoglycans, type-1 collagen) stabilize beta2-m amyloid fibrils and inhibit their depolymerization.  Typical manifestations include: $• Scapulohumeral periarthritis (pain/hypertrophy from rotator cuff infiltration) $• Carpal tunnel syndrome (@median neuropathy@ from carpal tunnel deposition) $• Flexor tenosynovitis (contractures from involvement of flexor tendons) $• Bone cysts (possible pathologic fractures) $DRA prevalence increases with age and dialysis duration.  Although improved dialysis membranes provide better clearance of beta2-m, its prevalence remains significant. $#(Choice A)#  Free immunoglobulin light chains are produced in excess by clonal expansion of plasma cells in multiple myeloma and deposited as AL amyloid.  AL amyloid typically results in nephrotic syndrome, hepatomegaly, restrictive cardiomyopathy, and neuropathy.  Macroglossia and periorbital purpura are less common but characteristic. $#(Choice B)#  Serum amyloid A is an acute phase protein excessively produced due to elevated cytokines in chronic infectious or inflammatory conditions (eg, tuberculosis, rheumatoid arthritis).  Accumulation produces AA amyloid, which deposits primarily in the kidneys, liver, and spleen.  This patient has no chronic infectious or inflammatory conditions. $#(Choices D and E)#  Transthyretin is a protein named for its function (transports thyroxin and retinol).  Inherited mutation or age can cause its deposition as amyloid with prominent cardiac involvement. $#Educational objective#: Beta2-microglobulin is renally cleared and poorly dialyzed.  It accumulates as amyloid in dialysis patients, increasing in prevalence with dialysis duration, and has a predilection for osteoarticular surfaces.  Shoulder pain and carpal tunnel syndrome are common.  Bone cysts and pathologic fractures may also occur. ",

  "explanation_2": "$In the physiologic state, parathyroid hormone (PTH) causes an overall increase in serum calcium (Ca2+) and a decrease serum phosphate (PO4) via the following effects: $• Increasing osteoclastic bone resorption, releasing Ca2+ and PO4 into serum $• Increasing renal calcium reabsorption and reducing phosphate reabsorption $• Increasing formation of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (by upregulating renal 1-alpha-hydroxylase), which increases intestinal Ca2+ and PO4 absorption $PTH production is very sensitive to small changes in serum free Ca2+ and is regulated by a negative feedback mechanism: increased Ca2+ will suppress PTH, but decreased Ca2+ will increase PTH. $In #chronic kidney disease# (CKD), PO4 clearance declines due to the fall in GFR.  The #increased PO4# binds free serum Ca2+, resulting in #hypocalcemia#.  Loss of normal renal parenchyma reduces 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D synthesis, resulting in a significant decline in intestinal Ca2+ absorption and Ca2+ release from bone.  This further exacerbates the hypocalcemia, which along with hyperphosphatemia and low calcitriol, stimulates PTH production (#secondary hyperparathyroidism#). $#(Choice B)#  In primary hyperparathyroidism, serum Ca2+ is elevated but does not suppress PTH due to autonomous gland function.  In longstanding CKD, PTH release may become independent of Ca2+ levels due to chronic parathyroid cell stimulation; PTH remains elevated despite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and Ca2+ supplementation (#tertiary hyperparathyroidism#).  However, this is less common than secondary hyperparathyroidism and is usually seen in patients with end-stage renal disease (ie, on dialysis). $#(Choice C)#  Calcitriol and Ca2+ supplementation in patients with CKD often returns PTH and Ca2+ levels to normal. $#(Choice D)#  Low PTH with hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia is seen in hypoparathyroidism. $#(Choice E)#  High serum Ca2+ with low PTH is seen in patients with PTH-independent causes of hypercalcemia, which include hypercalcemia of malignancy, vitamin D toxicity, excessive Ca2+ ingestion, thyrotoxicosis, and immobilization (Ca2+ resorbed from inactive bones). $#Educational objective# Chronic kidney disease usually causes hyperphosphatemia (binds serum Ca2+) and low 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (decreases intestinal Ca2+ absorption and Ca2+ release from bone).

  "explanation_2": "This patient with a vasopressin-2 (V2) receptor mutation has polyuria and hypernatremia, findings which are consistent with congenital #nephrogenic diabetes insipidus# (DI). $#V2 receptors# are located in the renal cortical collecting ducts.  When serum osmolality rises (eg, water deprivation, dehydration), there is increased release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH, vasopressin) which activates V2 receptors to reabsorb water into the systemic circulation.  Water reabsorption leads to concentrated urine (low urinary volume, high urine osmolality) and lower serum osmolality. $#Mutations #that impair normal V2 receptor function result in nephrogenic DI (#ADH resistance#).  Following water deprivation, the collecting ducts are unable to reabsorb water despite high circulating ADH levels, leading to ongoing urinary water losses.  Therefore, nephrogenic DI manifests with large volumes of abnormally #dilute urine# (ie, polyuria with low urine osmolality), #high serum osmolality# (ie, hypernatremia), and dehydration. $High serum osmolality, polyuria, and dilute urine also occur in central DI, which is caused by deficient ADH production by the hypothalamus.  As with nephrogenic DI, urine remains abnormally dilute after water deprivation.  However, #challenge with desmopressin# (an analogue of ADH) can differentiate between central and nephrogenic DI: $In nephrogenic DI, desmopressin cannot correct the underlying ADH resistance.  Therefore, #urine osmolality remains unchanged# (eg, low). $In #central DI#, desmopressin corrects the underlying ADH deficiency.  Therefore, #urine osmolality increases# following administration #(choice C)#. $#(Choice B)#  High baseline serum osmolality and high urine osmolality can be seen in states of marked hyperglycemia with glucosuria (ie, solute diuresis).  Although polyuria can occur, the ADH response remains intact, so urine osmolality will be high with water deprivation. $#(Choice D) # Primary polydipsia can also result in polyuria with dilute urine.  However, unlike DI, serum osmolality and sodium are low (due to excess water intake), and dilute urine represents an appropriate physiologic response.  ADH response is intact, so urine osmolality is appropriately high following water deprivation.  No additional change is seen with desmopressin because maximum ADH levels are reached with water deprivation. $#(Choices E and F)#  This patient has visible signs of dehydration and hypernatremia; because sodium is a major determinant of serum osmolality, a high serum osmolality is expected. $#Educational objective# Vasopressin-2 receptor mutations are a cause of congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, a condition in which renal resistance to antidiuretic hormone results in excessive urinary water losses.

PTH exerts the following #dual effects# on bone: $• Increases #bone formation# by stimulating the differentiation and activity of osteoblasts $• Increases #bone resorption# by transforming osteoblasts into osteoclasts $This balanced process allows for normal bone turnover but can become disrupted in conditions that alter PTH secretion, such as @secondary hyperparathyroidism@ in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).  In CKD, hypocalcemia, caused by decreased formation of active vitamin D and decreased renal phosphate excretion, triggers #PTH secretion# in an attempt to increase serum calcium.  Despite releasing calcium from bones, this compensatory response is unable to fully normalize serum calcium (due to the failing kidneys) and therefore results in chronic PTH elevation (ie, @loss of negative feedback@). $Chronic PTH elevation leads to increased activity of both osteoclasts and osteoblasts; the increase in osteoclast activity exceeds that of osteoblasts, which results in #greater bone resorption than formation# (suggested by an elevated serum alkaline phosphatase).  A potential consequence of this high bone turnover is #osteitis fibrosa cystica#, a form of renal osteodystrophy characterized by weakened bone caused by the replacement of mineralized bone with fibrous tissue. $Serum elevations in PTH, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase, in conjunction with the plain radiography finding of #subperiosteal resorption#, are typically sufficient for the diagnosis of osteitis fibrosa cystica.  However, a bone biopsy would show an #increased# number of #osteoclasts and osteoblasts# throughout the bone trabeculae #(choice D)#. $#(Choice A)#  Excessive treatment of hyperparathyroidism can lead to chronically low PTH levels, which can cause adynamic bone disease.  Adynamic bone disease is another form of renal osteodystrophy characterized by a low bone turnover state with decreased cellularity (ie, decreased numbers of both osteoblasts and osteoclasts). $#(Choice B)#  The combination of decreased osteoclasts and increased osteoblasts is rarely seen in bone disease. $#Educational objective #Osteitis fibrosa cystica is a form of renal osteodystrophy characterized by abnormally high bone turnover caused by chronic parathyroid hormone stimulation of osteoclasts to a greater degree than that of osteoblasts.

SLE is an autoimmune disease that occurs due to the formation of autoantibodies against cell surface and nuclear antigens.

His evaluation shows multiple round lung lesions with microscopy revealing @rounded polygonal cells@ with #abundant clear cytoplasm#.  This presentation is consistent with metastatic clear cell carcinoma, the most common subtype of #renal cell carcinoma# (RCC). The cytoplasm appears clear due to the high glycogen and lipid content of the tumor.  For the same reason, this neoplasm is often golden-yellow on macroscopic examination. $Patients with RCC are often asymptomatic; the classic triad of hematuria, flank pain, and palpable abdominal mass occur together in less than 10% of cases, often late in the course of the disease.  #Nonspecific symptoms# such as fever and weight loss are more common.  Paraneoplastic syndromes, including polycythemia (constitutive secretion of erythropoietin) and hypercalcemia (synthesis of parathyroid hormone-related protein), can also occur. $Renal cell carcinoma is often #detected incidentally# since localizing symptoms only develop in advanced disease; metastases are often discovered earlier than the primary neoplasm.  RCC most commonly #metastasizes to the lungs#, where it often presents as large, rounded, well-circumscribed 'cannonball' metastases.  Osteolytic bone lesions and liver metastases also occur frequently. $#(Choice A)#  @Osteosarcoma@ frequently metastasizes to the lungs, but most patients have localized pain at the primary site (eg, distal femur), and polycythemia is unexpected.  Histologically, pleomorphic malignant tumor cells with osteoid matrix production would be seen. $#(Choice B)#  Primary brain neoplasms usually metastasize within the CNS; although they can rarely metastasize outside the nervous system, they would not be associated with polycythemia. $#(Choices C and E)#  Colon and stomach cancers commonly metastasize to the lungs.  Microscopy of @diffuse-type gastric adenocarcinoma@ demonstrates signet ring cells with clear cytoplasmic mucin and eccentric nuclei (resembling a signet ring).  @Colonic adenocarcinoma@ forms glands and tubules.  However, patients typically develop anemia due to occult bleeding, not polycythemia. $#(Choice F)#  Testicular cancer also commonly metastasizes to the lung, but patients typically have a testicular mass.  β-hCG or alpha-fetoprotein are often elevated; however, hematocrit elevations are unexpected.  Histology varies by malignancy. $#Educational objective# Clear cell carcinoma is the most common subtype of renal cell carcinoma and is composed of large, rounded, or polygonal cells with clear cytoplasm.

  "explanation_2": "This patient has #Goodpasture syndrome#, which is caused by autoantibodies against the #alpha 3 chain of type IV collagen# found in the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) and pulmonary capillary membrane (#anti-GBM antibodies#).  Antibody formation may be triggered by an antecedent viral respiratory infection, although most cases are idiopathic.  These antibodies promote inflammatory injury of the glomerular and alveolar basement membranes, resulting in rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and alveolar hemorrhage, respectively. $#Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis# results in nephritic syndrome, characterized by hypertension, edema, acute renal failure, hematuria (eg, dysmorphic red cells and red cell casts), and proteinuria.  On renal biopsy, @light microscopy@ shows glomerular crescent formation and @immunofluorescence@ shows linear deposition of IgG and C3 on the GBM.  #Alveolar hemorrhage# manifests with shortness of breath and hemoptysis with infiltrates on chest x-ray.  Hemoglobin in the alveoli leads to increased alveolar oxygen absorption and high carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO). $#(Choice B)#  Patients with beta-hemolytic streptococci infection of the pharynx or skin can develop glomerular immune complex deposition resulting in poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis and nephritic syndrome; however, this usually occurs in children and pulmonary involvement with alveolar hemorrhage is not characteristic. $#(Choice C)#  Anticardiolipin antibodies are characteristic of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, which typically presents with unprovoked/recurrent arterial and venous thrombosis or recurrent spontaneous abortions. $#(Choice D)#  Antibodies to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) are typically seen in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), particularly in individuals with active lupus nephritis.  Although this patient has findings of glomerulonephritis, other features of SLE such as constitutional symptoms (eg, fatigue, fever, weight loss), malar rash, arthritis, serositis, and cytopenias are not evident.  Pulmonary hemorrhage is also not characteristic of SLE. $#(Choice E)#  Anti-topoisomerase I (anti-Scl-70) antibodies are found in patients with systemic sclerosis, which typically presents with diffuse thickening/hardening of the skin, Raynaud phenomenon, and esophageal dysfunction.  Acute renal failure and hypertension may occur during scleroderma renal crisis; however, glomerulonephritis is not characteristic.  Lung involvement typically leads to pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary arterial hypertension as opposed to pulmonary hemorrhage. $#Educational objective# Goodpasture syndrome is caused by autoantibodies against the alpha 3 chain of type IV collagen in glomerular and alveolar basement membranes (anti-GBM antibodies).

  "explanation_2": "$  This patient has progressive lower urinary tract symptoms, likely due to #benign prostatic hyperplasia# (BPH).  BPH is common in older men and is characterized by a combination of epithelial and stromal hyperplasia, predominantly in the periurethral and transition zones.  On palpation, the prostate has a rubbery consistency, in contrast to prostate cancer, in which the gland is nodular and very firm. $As the prostate enlarges it impinges on the prostatic urethra, causing progressively worsening #bladder outlet obstruction#.  This leads to problems voiding (eg, hesitancy, straining, weak urinary stream) and impaired urine storage (eg, daytime frequency, urgency, nocturia).  As BPH progresses, incomplete bladder emptying leads to overflow incontinence (involuntary urine spillage from an overly full bladder).  #Increased hydrostatic force# is needed to overcome the obstruction, causing hypertrophy of the bladder wall musculature and dilation of the ureters, renal pelvis, and calyces (#hydronephrosis#).  If left untreated, urinary reflux can lead to significant pressure-induced #parenchymal atrophy# with scarring and eventual #chronic kidney disease#. $#(Choice A)#  Glomerular sclerosis and hyalinosis are typical of diabetic nephrosclerosis and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS).  Diabetes can cause autonomic neuropathy with overflow incontinence, but it is rare and typically occurs in poorly controlled chronic diabetes.  FSGS does not cause lower urinary tract symptoms. $#(Choice B)#  Hyperplastic arteriolar changes are seen in severe (malignant) hypertension.  Hypertension does not cause lower urinary tract symptoms.  Additionally, this patient does not have a history of high blood pressure or symptoms associated with malignant hypertension (eg, headache, blurred vision). $#(Choice C)#  Ischemic tubular necrosis results from decreased renal perfusion (eg, sepsis, hemorrhage, heart failure).  Patients develop oliguria, azotemia (elevated blood levels of nitrogenous wastes), elevated serum creatinine, and electrolyte disturbances. $#(Choice E)#  Epithelial dysplasia (eg, alterations in cell shape and size, nuclei size, and staining) is considered a precursor of malignancy.  BPH does not predispose to renal tubular dysplasia or prostate cancer. $#Educational objective# Benign prostatic hyperplasia leads to progressive bladder outlet obstruction.  Over time, increased urinary pressures can cause hydronephrosis and renal parenchymal atrophy with scarring.  This can progress to chronic kidney disease. "

Patients with RCC classically have a triad of flank pain, palpable mass, and hematuria, although many remain asymptomatic until the disease is advanced. $RCC is a highly vascular tumor that #invades the renal vein# in up to 25% of cases.  IVC obstruction can occur due to intraluminal extension and thrombus formation, rather than mass effect from the tumor itself.  The obstruction can occur acutely or gradually over time.  In chronic cases, collateral venous circulation may develop based on the site of the obstruction.  Prominent abdominal wall #collateral veins#, as in this patient, suggest obstruction of the upper segment of the IVC. $#(Choices A, B, and E)#  The femoral, iliac, and saphenous veins are too low in the legs to produce significant abdominal wall collateral veins if obstructed.  Obstruction of these veins would be more likely to cause varices on the legs, thighs, and hips.  In addition, unilateral (rather than bilateral) lower extremity edema would be expected. $#(Choice D)#  Obstruction of the portal vein is most commonly associated with severe hepatic cirrhosis.  Affected patients have shunting of blood through portocaval anastomoses, leading to hemorrhoids, esophageal varices, and caput medusae about the umbilicus.  They may also have ascites. $#Educational objective# Renal cell carcinoma tends to invade the renal vein; inferior vena cava obstruction can occur by intraluminal extension of the tumor.  Obstruction of the inferior vena cava produces symmetric bilateral lower extremity edema, often associated with prominent development of venous collaterals in the abdominal wall. "

Vomiting causes a significant loss of gastric H+ from the body, which leads to #increased serum HCO3−# (metabolic alkalosis).  There is also loss of water and salt (relatively more Cl− is lost than Na+ due to high gastric quantity of @HCl@), leading to volume depletion that perpetuates the metabolic alkalosis and causes other electrolyte abnormalities. $Intravascular volume depletion decreases renal perfusion, resulting in activation of the #renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system#.  Aldosterone stimulates Na+ reabsorption and a lesser degree of passive Cl− reabsorption in the distal tubules of the kidneys in an effort to increase blood volume.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient's presentation is consistent with #metabolic bone disease# due to chronic kidney disease (CKD).  CKD decreases the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which decreases the filtered phosphate load and causes #elevated serum phosphate levels#.  Hyperphosphatemia reduces serum free calcium and stimulates osteocytes and osteoclasts to release fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23), a circulating peptide that decreases proximal tubule phosphate reabsorption.  Elevated levels of phosphate and FGF-23 also #reduce calcitriol synthesis# by inhibiting the proximal tubular expression of 1-alpha-hydroxylase, resulting in decreased intestinal calcium and phosphate absorption.  This worsens hypocalcemia but does not significantly improve hyperphosphatemia due to the low GFR, which is the limiting factor for phosphate excretion in patients with advanced CKD. $Hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia also #increase parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion#, which stimulates osteoclasts to increase bone turnover.  Long-term elevation in PTH (secondary hyperparathyroidism) can eventually lead to friable bones and #osteitis fibrosa#.  Affected patients can develop weakness, #bone pain#, and fractures. $#(Choice A)#  Primary hyperparathyroidism causes hypercalcemia and decreased serum phosphate due to inappropriately elevated PTH.  Renal synthesis of calcitriol is also increased by PTH.  In contrast, calcitriol levels remain low in patients with CKD due to the reduction in renal mass and the inhibitory effects of FGF-23 and phosphate. $#(Choice B)#  Vitamin D toxicity raises calcitriol levels, which increases calcium and phosphate absorption causing hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia.  Hypercalcemia inhibits PTH release, lowering serum PTH. $#(Choice D)#  Vitamin D deficiency in patients with normally functioning kidneys decreases intestinal calcium and phosphate absorption, leading to lower serum phosphate and calcium levels.  The resulting hypocalcemia stimulates PTH release from the parathyroid glands. $#(Choice E)#  Primary hypoparathyroidism causes hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia due to decreased PTH.  Calcitriol levels can also be low due to decreased PTH-mediated stimulation of renal 1-alpha-hydroxylase. $#Educational objective# Chronic kidney disease causes disordered mineralization and bone metabolism that usually presents with hyperphosphatemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and decreased calcitriol levels.

Glomerular @crescent formation@ occurs in response to immune or inflammatory-mediated injury to glomerular capillaries.

Initiation of the coagulation cascade promotes the deposition of #large quantities of fibrin#, while inflammatory cells proliferate and release growth factors and inflammatory cytokines that recruit fibroblasts and stimulate parietal cell proliferation.

Renal infarctions are most commonly caused by #cardioembolic disease# (ie, originating from the left atrium or ventricle).  #Atrial fibrillation#, suggested by this patient's intermittent palpitations and history of sleep apnea, is the greatest risk factor, although emboli from mural thrombi (following myocardial infarction), prosthetic valves, or valvular vegetations (ie, endocarditis) are also implicated.  Complete occlusion of the renal artery can occur more rarely due to direct arterial injury (eg, dissection, vasculitis) or hypercoagulable states (eg, antiphospholipid syndrome).  The kidneys are predisposed to embolic infarctions due to their high perfusion rates and limited collateral circulation. $Typical presenting symptoms include #flank pain#, #nausea#, vomiting, and low-grade fever.  #Hypertension# can occur due to renin release from hypoxic renal tissue.

AUR is characterized by the inability to voluntarily micturate, which leads to suprapubic pain with #bladder distension#, often palpable above the pelvic brim.  As urine refluxes into the ureters and kidneys, dilation of the ureters, renal pelvis, and calyces (hydronephrosis) results in #acute kidney injury#, bilateral flank pain, and costovertebral angle tenderness.  Elevations in creatinine and blood urea nitrogen are also common, but the ratio between the two is variable. $Etiologies of AUR include: $• Bladder outlet obstruction:  By far the most common cause of urinary retention, bladder outlet obstructions are precipitated by #urethral compression# typically due to #benign prostatic hyperplasia#, particularly in men age >50.  Other etiologies include transitional cell carcinoma and rectal or uterine malignancy. $• Medications:  AUR is commonly caused by anticholinergic medications (eg, oxybutynin, atropine) and sympathomimetics (eg, pseudoephedrine). $• Neurologic dysfunction:  Diabetic neuropathy, spinal cord injury, and stroke can result in a neurogenic bladder. $#(Choice A)#  Diabetic nephropathy typically presents with proteinuria and chronic kidney disease rather than acute anuria with bilateral flank pain.

In addition, although interstitial nephritis can present with oliguria, an overly distended bladder would not be characteristic. $#(Choices C and D)#  Ischemia (eg, due to hypotension) can cause tubular necrosis.  Abundant protein casts can form in multiple myeloma, leading to obstruction and necrosis of the renal tubules.  Both cause intrinsic renal injury with an elevation in creatinine; however, a distended bladder would be unexpected. $#Educational objective# Acute urinary retention is characterized by anuria and bladder distension and can result in hydronephrosis and acute kidney injury.  A palpable, distended bladder is present on examination, and abdominal and flank pain may be present.  The most common cause of urinary retention is bladder outlet obstruction (urethral compression) due to benign prostatic hyperplasia. "

  "explanation_2": "$This child most likely has minimal change disease, the most common cause of #nephrotic syndrome# in children.  It typically presents suddenly after an upper respiratory infection.  The classic features of nephrotic syndrome are #heavy proteinuria# (>3.5 g/day in adults and >50 mg/kg/day in children), #hypoalbuminemia# (<3 g/dL), #generalized edema#, and #hyperlipidemia#.  Two mechanisms, @underfilling and overfilling@, contribute to the pathogenesis of edema in nephrotic syndrome.  The underfilling mechanism is particularly significant in minimal change disease in children and presents as follows: $#1. Increased glomerular capillary permeability# to plasma proteins leads to massive #loss of protein# (predominantly albumin) in the urine. $2. The large decrease in serum albumin causes a #drop in intravascular oncotic pressure#, which results in fluid moving into the interstitial space and edema formation #(choice C)#. $3. The fluid shift results in intravascular volume depletion (ie, underfilling), which triggers the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system to increase aldosterone synthesis (secondary hyperaldosteronism) and antidiuretic hormone secretion #(choice B)#.  The result is intravascular #sodium and water retention (Choice E)#.  This fluid leaks back out into the interstitial space due to the low oncotic pressure, exacerbating the edema. $4. Low intravascular oncotic pressure stimulates #increased lipoprotein production# in the liver.  Impaired lipid catabolism due to decreased lipoprotein lipase and abnormal transport of circulating lipid particles also contributes to hyperlipidemia. $#(Choice A)#  When the serum albumin level decreases due to its massive loss in the urine, the liver responds by increasing albumin synthesis.  However, the amount of renal albumin loss exceeds the liver synthetic capacity. $#Educational objective# Minimal change disease is the most common childhood nephrotic syndrome.  Increased glomerular capillary permeability causes massive protein (eg, albumin) loss in the urine.  Hypoalbuminemia reduces plasma oncotic pressure, which causes a fluid shift into the interstitial space, resulting in edema.  Low oncotic pressure also triggers increased lipoprotein production in the liver (ie, hyperlipidemia). ",

This presentation suggests #minimal change disease# (MCD), the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in #young children#.  MCD is often idiopathic but can occur after an inciting event, including respiratory infections, immunizations, or insect sting/bite.  Subsequent T-cell dysfunction leads to the production of a glomerular permeability factor (possibly IL-13) which damages podocytes and decreases the anionic properties of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM).  Loss of negative charge results in the selective loss of albumin in the urine, which causes hypoalbuminemia and edema. $Most children with MCD can be diagnosed presumptively based on clinical presentation, and renal biopsy is usually unnecessary.  If biopsy is performed, @light microscopy@ (LM) shows #normal glomeruli#, and #no immunoglobulin# or complement deposits are seen with immunofluorescent staining.  However, @electron microscopy@ (EM) shows diffuse #podocyte foot process effacement# and fusion.  These abnormal findings are generally reversible after corticosteroid therapy, and most children experience rapid resolution with an excellent long-term prognosis. $#(Choice A)#  @IgA nephropathy@ presents with nephritic syndrome; patients typically develop marked hematuria with red blood cell casts on urinalysis.

LM demonstrates hypercellular glomeruli, whereas IF shows a 'lumpy-bumpy' pattern of granular IgG and C3 deposition on the GBM.  EM also demonstrates subepithelial immune complex deposits. $#(Choice C)#  @Antiglomerular basement membrane disease@ causes a linear deposition of IgG and C3 on the GBM; it typically results in a @crescentic glomerulonephritis@ (eg, nephritic syndrome; hematuria, red blood cell casts) visible on LM.  EM demonstrates breakage of the GBM, but immune complex deposits are absent. $#(Choice D)#  @Membranous nephropathy@ causes a nephrotic syndrome but is rarer in children; it is often associated with viral hepatitis, solid tumors, or lupus.  LM reveals diffuse GBM thickening, which is due to the granular deposition of immune complexes (IgG and C3); EM demonstrates subepithelial deposits. $#Educational objective# Minimal change disease is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children.

Other commonly associated conditions include gout, high cell turnover states (eg, lymphoproliferative disorders), and metabolic syndrome. $#(Choice A)#  Dietary calcium and oxalate normally form insoluble complexes, which are eliminated in the feces.  Disruption of the normal enterohepatic circulation of bile acids can cause malabsorption of dietary lipids, which then form soap complexes with calcium, allowing increased absorption of free oxalate.  The excess oxalate is then excreted by the kidneys where it promotes formation of calcium oxalate stones.  These stones are radio-opaque. $#(Choice C)#  Overproduction of uric acid (eg, gout, myeloproliferative disorders) can lead to uric acid stones.  However, this patient has no features of these disorders, and her stone formation is likely due to abnormally concentrated and acidic urine. $#(Choice D)#  Hydrolysis of urea by urease-producing bacteria (eg, Proteus, Klebsiella) yields ammonia, which alkalinizes the urine and promotes formation of magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) stones.  These stones are large and radio-opaque, and typically present with fever and moderate flank pain. $#(Choice E)#  Hyperparathyroidism leads to hypercalcemia and an increased filtered calcium load.  The subsequent hypercalciuria increases the risk of radio-opaque calcium (oxalate, phosphate) stones. $#Educational objective# Formation of uric acid kidney stones is promoted by low urine pH, which favors formation of insoluble uric acid over soluble urate ion.

Patients initially have symptoms of ethanol intoxication; signs of acute renal failure (oliguria, flank pain) develop approximately 24-72 hours after ingestion.  Ethylene glycol itself is relatively nontoxic; however, it is metabolized to glycolic acid and oxalic acid, resulting in its various toxicities. $Acute kidney injury occurs due to both glycolic acid, which causes #direct tubular cytotoxicity#, and oxalic acid, which crystalizes and causes tubular obstruction.

It also typically occurs in older patients and presents with hypercalcemia and anemia; altered mentation is unexpected. $#(Choice C)#  Hyperparathyroidism causes hypercalcemia, which predisposes patients to calcium stone (eg, calcium oxalate) formation.

  "explanation_2": "This patient's biopsy findings are consistent with #hypertensive nephrosclerosis# (HN), a complication of chronic hypertension that is most common in elderly patients.  Prolonged elevation of systemic blood pressure causes the renal arterioles to undergo compensatory #medial hypertrophy# and #fibrointimal proliferation#.  Endothelial damage leads to deposition of plasma proteins and basement membrane material in the arteriolar walls (#hyaline arteriolosclerosis#).  The resultant lumenal narrowing restricts renal blood flow, resulting in glomerular ischemia and fibrosis (#glomerulosclerosis#) with collapse of the capillary loops and thickening of the Bowman capsule.  Gross examination of affected kidneys shows mild #renal atrophy# with a finely granular surface. $HN generally progresses slowly, and most patients with mild to moderate disease do not develop renal insufficiency.  However, advanced disease occurs more commonly in patients of African American descent and in those with severe hypertension or comorbid diabetes.  Proteinuria is common in advanced disease, but #urinalysis# is otherwise typically #bland# (eg, no casts, red or white blood cells).  Like all chronic kidney diseases, advanced HN can cause #anemia #due to a reduction in renal erythropoietin production. $#(Choice A)#  Analgesic nephropathy can occur with prolonged, excessive nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory use.  However, pathologic findings typically include papillary necrosis and tubulointerstitial nephritis. $#(Choice B)#  Fibromuscular dysplasia causes renal artery stenosis, resulting in refractory hypertension.  However, it typically occurs in younger women (age <50), and histology characteristically shows fibromuscular ridges alternating with areas of aneurysmal dilation affecting the main renal artery. $#(Choice C)#  Hepatitis C infection can cause membranous nephropathy, which presents with nephrotic syndrome (eg, proteinuria, edema).  Histology demonstrates diffuse thickening of the glomerular basement membrane without glomerular hypercellularity. $#(Choice E)#  Multiple myeloma can cause anemia and renal disease, but histology typically demonstrates a light chain cast nephropathy; eosinophilic casts obstruct the renal tubules, resulting in tubular inflammation and fibrosis.  Patients typically also have fatigue, constipation (hypercalcemia), and bone pain (lytic lesions). $#Educational objective# Chronic hypertension can result in hypertensive nephrosclerosis, which is characterized by compensatory medial hypertrophy and fibrointimal proliferation; endothelial damage from elevated systemic pressure also leads to hyaline arteriolosclerosis.  The narrowed arteriolar lumens cause a progressive decrease in renal blood flow, resulting in glomerular ischemia and fibrosis (glomerulosclerosis). "

HCV-infected patients often produce cryoglobulins against #exogenous# HCV antigens that form #circulating ICs#, which activate complement, causing hypocomplementemia.  These circulating ICs can deposit in small vessels ('cryoglobulinemic vasculitis') affecting the kidney (eg, membranoproliferative GN), skin (eg, palpable purpura), and joints (eg, arthralgias). $#(Choices A and B)#  Antibodies targeting glomerular antigens, whether intrinsic (eg, membranous nephropathy) or deposited (eg, poststreptococcal GN), form ICs within the kidney; this typically results in renal-limited disease.  Anti-GBM disease is an exception because the antibodies are directed against type IV collagen, which is also present in alveoli resulting in alveolar hemorrhage.  This patient's fever, arthralgias, and rash indicate a systemic process characteristic of circulating immune complex deposition. $#(Choice C)#  Antibodies targeting neutrophil antigens (myeloperoxidase, proteinase 3) can activate neutrophils, causing ANCA-associated GN and SVV (without significant IC deposition).  Although the skin and joints can be affected, the respiratory tract and nerves are typically involved, and hypocomplementemia is unusual. $#(Choice D)#  Preformed circulating ICs against endogenous antigens are the cause of IgA nephropathy and lupus nephritis.  IgA nephropathy is more common in children following upper respiratory infections; serum complement is usually normal because IgA fixes complement poorly.  Lupus nephritis is associated with arthralgia, vasculitis, and hypocomplementemia; however, this patient's presentation (eg, male sex, sexual risk factors) is more suggestive of underlying hepatitis C infection. $#Educational objective# Immune glomerular injury results from immune complexes (ICs) or neutrophil activation.  IC formation in the kidney typically produces renal-limited disease (except anti–glomerular basement membrane disease).  Preformed circulating IC deposition is usually associated with small vessel vasculitis and hypocomplementemia. "

  "explanation_2": "This patient's imaging shows an atrophic left kidney associated with a large, hyperdense mass filling the renal pelvis.  These findings are consistent with a chronic @staghorn calculus@, a type of kidney stone that occurs in patients with recurrent upper urinary tract infection caused by #urease-producing organisms# (eg, Proteus, Klebsiella).  Hydrolysis of urea yields #ammonia#, which #alkalinizes the urine# (ie, pH >7) and facilitates precipitation of @struvite crystals@ (magnesium ammonium phosphate). $Because of the large quantities of urea excreted in urine, struvite stones can #grow rapidly# into a branched staghorn calculus that #fills the renal calyces and pelvis#.  Symptoms are usually related to the underlying infection (eg, fever, mild costovertebral pain, hematuria); renal colic (ie, severe flank/groin pain) is uncommon because large stones are unable to pass into the ureter and cause acute obstruction.  Over time, the affected #kidney can atrophy# due to recurrent infection and chronic obstructive nephropathy. $#(Choice A)#  Trace or weakly positive (eg, 1 or 2+) proteinuria can be seen in a variety of disorders (eg, hematuria due to kidney stones, urinary tract infection) due to disruption of the urothelium; however, a strongly positive result (eg, 3 or 4+) is more specific for glomerular protein loss (eg, amyloidosis, diabetic nephropathy) and is not usually due to stones. $#(Choice B)#  Eosinophiluria is typically associated with acute interstitial nephritis, which is most commonly triggered by exposure to certain medications (eg, beta-lactam antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs).  Patients typically have a rash, fever, and acute kidney injury, but this condition is not associated with staghorn calculi. $#(Choice D)#  Red cell casts and dysmorphic red blood cells form when erythrocytes traverse the renal tubules and indicate a glomerular bleeding source (eg, glomerulonephritis).  Staghorn calculi can cause hematuria with morphologically normal red cells due to irritation of the urothelium, but do not cause glomerular bleeding. $#(Choice E)#  Urine specific gravity correlates with urine concentration and is influenced by hydration status and regulatory hormone (eg, antidiuretic hormone) levels.  Kidney stones most commonly form in concentrated urine (eg, >1.015), which results in supersaturation of salts and crystal precipitation.  A specific gravity of ≤1.003 indicates dilute urine, and it is unlikely that a patient with an acute stone would have such a low specific gravity. $#(Choice F)#  Uric acid stones can occasionally form staghorn calculi but would typically be seen in patients with gout or conditions with rapid cell turnover (eg, myeloproliferative disorders) rather than recurrent urinary tract infection.  This patient is much more likely to have a struvite stone. $#Educational objective# Struvite stones are typically seen in patients with recurrent upper urinary infection by urease-producing organisms (eg, Proteus, Klebsiella).  Hydrolysis of urea yields ammonia, which alkalinizes the urine and facilitates precipitation of magnesium ammonium phosphate.  Urinalysis shows hematuria and elevated urine pH. ",

  "explanation_2": "$Recurrent nephrolithiasis in a young patient should raise suspicion for #cystinuria#, which is confirmed by the pathognomonic finding of #hexagonal-shaped crystals# on urinalysis.  Cystinuria is an autosomal recessive disorder affecting the high-affinity, sodium-independent dibasic amino acid transporter found on the apical membrane of intestinal and proximal renal tubular epithelial cells.  This prevents cystine (cysteine homodimer that forms disulfide bonds) and dibasic amino acids (eg, ornithine, lysine, and arginine) from being reabsorbed in the proximal renal tubules, leading to urine supersaturation with cystine and formation of #cystine stones# (ornithine, lysine, and arginine are relatively soluble in the urine and do not form stones). $Patients with suspected cystinuria without cystine crystals on urinalysis can be diagnosed by detecting elevated urinary cystine levels (ie, #aminoaciduria#).  The #sodium cyanide-nitroprusside test# is a qualitative screening test that detects the presence of urinary cystine.  Cyanide is initially added to the urine, converting cystine to cysteine.  Afterward, nitroprusside is added and reacts with the sulfhydryl group on free cysteine, causing a red-purple discoloration (positive test).  Treatment of cystinuria involves increasing hydration and #urinary alkalinization# (eg, acetazolamide). $#(Choices B, C, D, and E)#  Hypercalciuria (eg, sarcoidosis), hyperoxaluria (eg, Crohn disease), and hypocitraturia (eg, distal renal tubular acidosis) are risk factors for recurrent calcium stone formation; high concentrations of calcium or oxalate promote precipitation into stones, while citrate inhibits stone formation by complexing with calcium in the urine, preventing spontaneous nucleation and crystal growth.  Hyperuricosuria (eg, gout) is a risk factor for recurrent uric acid stones, particularly in the setting of low urine pH. $#Educational objective# Cystinuria results from defective cystine reabsorption by proximal renal tubular epithelial cells.  It most often presents with recurrent stone formation at a young age.  Urinalysis shows pathognomonic hexagonal cystine crystals, and the sodium cyanide-nitroprusside test can be used to detect excess cystine in the urine. "

  "explanation_2": "This patient has acute flank pain and tenderness consistent with #nephrolithiasis#.  The pain associated with nephrolithiasis (renal colic) is often severe and, although it may wax and wane, is generally not positional.  The pain commonly radiates to the groin, especially as the stone passes down the ureter to the ureterovesical junction.  Nausea and vomiting are common, and bowel sounds are often diminished due to an associated ileus.  Hematuria is usually present but may not be grossly visible. $Most kidney stones are calcium-based (calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate).  But regardless of chemical composition, low fluid intake can lead to #supersaturation# of urine with crystalline material and promote stone formation.  #Increasing fluid intake# can reduce the risk of all types of stones. $#(Choice A)#  Excessive alcohol intake can trigger acute pancreatitis.  The pain associated with pancreatitis is typically located in the epigastric area rather than the flank and radiates to the back rather than the groin. $#(Choice B)#  Recurrent infections of the upper urinary tract with urease-producing organisms (eg, Klebsiella, Proteus) can lead to formation of magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) stones.  These stones are often large and may fill the renal pelvis.  Although patients may have mild flank pain due to recurrent infection, acute renal colic is uncommon as these large stones do not travel down the ureter. $#(Choice D)#  A high-fiber diet is associated with a decreased risk of diverticulitis.  This condition typically presents over a few days (not suddenly, as in this patient) with lower abdominal pain and tenderness in the left lower quadrant. $#(Choice E)#  Calcium passively follows the reabsorption of sodium and water in the renal tubules.  Increased dietary sodium intake leads to reduced sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule and lowers calcium reabsorption (leading to hypercalciuria). $#(Choice F)#  Dietary calcium binds oxalate in the gut to form unabsorbable calcium oxalate.  Low-calcium diets lead to increased absorption of free oxalate, which is then excreted in the urine; the resulting hyperoxaluria promotes the formation of calcium oxalate stones.  Low-calcium diets are therefore paradoxically associated with increased risk of stone formation. $#(Choice G)#  Untreated infection with chlamydia or gonorrhea can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, presenting with lower abdominal pain and fever.  Examination findings include mucopurulent cervical discharge and cervical motion tenderness. $#Educational objective# Urine supersaturation is the main mechanism underlying all types of renal stones.  Low fluid intake increases the concentration of stone-forming agents, thereby promoting stone formation.  All patients with nephrolithiasis should be advised to maintain adequate fluid intake. "

Etiologies include volume loss (eg, hemorrhage), low-output states (eg, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure), or systemic vasodilation (eg, sepsis). $• #Intrinsic:#  Caused by #tubular epithelial or glomerular damage#; resorptive capacity is lost.  Etiologies include acute tubular necrosis (due to renal ischemia or nephrotoxins) or glomerular diseases (eg, glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome). $• #Postrenal:#  Caused by #urinary tract obstruction# with normal nephron capacity.  Etiologies include bilateral calculi, enlarged prostate, or a renal tumor in an individual with a sole functional kidney. $This patient with severe blood loss was at risk for prerenal and intrinsic renal failure; however, his rapid #improvement with hydration# suggests a prerenal (hypovolemic) etiology.  His laboratory results reflect intact renal tubular function, with compensatory mechanisms to restore blood volume.  Increased tubular sodium reabsorption results in #low urine sodium (<20 mEq/L)# and #low fractional excretion of sodium# (FENa), whereas increased water reabsorption leads to #high urine osmolarity#.  Urea reabsorption also increases to help concentrate the urine, resulting in increased serum levels of urea; creatinine continues to be excreted, resulting in the characteristic #BUN/creatinine ratio >20#. $In contrast, intrinsic ARF reflects tubular epithelium damage and loss of renal reabsorptive capacity.  Water, sodium, and urea are excreted in the urine, leading to lower urine osmolarity, higher urinary sodium, higher urinary FENa, and a normal serum BUN/creatinine ratio. $#(Choice A)#  Dark, granular, \"muddy brown\" casts seen on urinalysis are composed of degenerating tubular epithelial cells.  This finding is associated with acute tubular necrosis, which is a common cause of intrinsic ARF. $#(Choices B, C, and D)#  A serum BUN/creatinine ratio <15, urine FENa >2%, and urine osmolarity <350 mOsm/kg are characteristic of intrinsic ARF.  These alterations in the laboratory indices of renal function represent the diminished ability of tubular epithelial cells to reabsorb urea, sodium, and water, respectively. $#Educational objective# Blood volume loss can cause prerenal or intrinsic acute renal failure (ARF).  Prerenal ARF is associated with normal nephron function (eg, low urine sodium level, low fractionated sodium excretion, high urine osmolarity, and a high BUN/creatinine ratio), whereas intrinsic ARF features diminished renal reabsorptive capacity (eg, lower urine osmolarity, higher urinary sodium, normal serum BUN/creatinine ratio).

Therefore, #serum protein electrophoresis# would be helpful to look for a monoclonal protein produced by an undiagnosed plasma cell dyscrasia (eg, multiple myeloma, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia) causing AL amyloidosis. $#(Choice A)#  24-hour urinary copper excretion is elevated in Wilson disease, which typically presents with hepatic, neurologic, and psychiatric abnormalities.  Renal involvement is less common and causes tubular (eg, Fanconi syndrome) rather than glomerular dysfunction. $#(Choice B)#  24-hour urinary uric acid excretion is useful for evaluating disorders with hyperuricemia (eg, gout, kidney stones).  @Uric acid crystals@ share the property of birefringence on polarized microscopy.  However, nephrotic syndrome would be unexpected even with chronic urate nephropathy. $#(Choice D)#  Serum total bilirubin concentration is elevated in multiple disorders and can result from overproduction, impaired conjugation, biliary obstruction, or hepatocyte damage.  It has no role in determining the type of amyloidosis causing nephrotic syndrome. $#(Choice E)#  Serum total body iron content is indicated for the assessment of anemia and iron overload, neither of which is associated with nephrotic syndrome.  Liver biopsy is sometimes performed for @iron overload@, which shows intense staining with Prussian blue. $#Educational objective# Renal amyloidosis typically presents with proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome.  The diagnosis is confirmed by kidney biopsy showing apple-green birefringence with Congo red stain under polarized light.  Serum protein electrophoresis demonstrating a monoclonal protein helps establish the diagnosis of immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis. ",

  "explanation_2": "$#Diabetic nephropathy (DN)# is the most common cause of end-stage renal disease in the United States.  It occurs in both types 1 and 2 diabetes.  The earliest morphological change is glomerular basement membrane thickening with mesangial matrix expansion.  Normally, the glomerular basement membrane has negatively charged heparan sulfate moieties that form a charge barrier preventing leakage of negatively charged proteins (eg, albumin) into the Bowman capsule.  In diabetes, there is progressive loss of this negative charge due to upregulation of heparanase expression by renal epithelial cells, leading to leakage of albumin and other plasma proteins. $In the initial stages of DN, only small amounts of albumin (30-300 mg/day; ie, #moderately increased albuminuria#) are lost but can be detected with an albumin-specific urine assay (regular dipstick urinalysis has low sensitivity and is not recommended).  Early administration of #ACE inhibitors# in patients with diabetes and moderately increased albuminuria can reduce urinary albumin excretion and slow progression to overt DN. $#(Choice B)#  Glycosuria is seen at blood glucose levels >200-300 mg/dL due to saturation of renal glucose transporters.  Glycosuria reflects poor glycemic control but does not correlate with the degree of renal damage in DN. $#(Choice C)#  Ketonuria occurs in starvation and in conditions that cause ketoacidosis, such as insufficient insulin administration in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.  It is usually a transient phenomenon that corrects with treatment of the ketoacidosis. $#(Choice D)#  Red blood cell casts are a sign of glomerular bleeding, such as in glomerulonephritis (eg, poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis).  Diabetes mellitus usually causes a nephrotic syndrome with proteinuria and a bland urine sediment. $#(Choice E)#  Low-molecular-weight proteins (eg, beta-2 microglobulin, immunoglobulin light chains) are normally filtered by the glomerulus and reabsorbed in the renal tubules.  Damage to the tubular cells can cause loss of these tubular proteins in urine.  Ischemic tubular damage may be seen in advanced DN. $#(Choice F)#  Waxy casts are shiny, translucent structures formed in the dilated tubules of enlarged nephrons that undergo compensatory hypertrophy in response to reduced renal mass.  They indicate advanced renal disease (chronic renal failure). $#Educational objective# Moderately increased albuminuria (urine albumin 30-300 mg/day) is the earliest manifestation of diabetic nephropathy.

When urinary citrate is low (#hypocitraturia#), increased calcium availability leads to formation of calcium-oxalate complexes that can precipitate and form #calcium oxalate stones#.  Hypocitraturia often occurs in the setting of chronic metabolic acidosis (eg, distal renal tubular acidosis, chronic diarrhea) due to enhanced renal citrate reabsorption.  Supplemental oral potassium citrate is often prescribed to prevent recurrent calcium stones. $#(Choice A)#  Individuals with higher (but not excessive) calcium intake paradoxically have a lower risk of calcium oxalate stone formation.  Dietary calcium binds oxalate in the gut to form insoluble calcium oxalate, which is eliminated in the feces.  This reduces the amount of oxalate absorbed into the body and excreted in the urine, reducing stone formation. $#(Choice B)#  In patients with inadequate dietary intake of potassium, increased tubular reabsorption of potassium leads to increased citrate reabsorption, which facilitates formation of calcium oxalate complexes in the renal tubules.  Higher potassium intake promotes urinary excretion of citrate and lowers urinary calcium excretion, leading to a lower risk of calcium oxalate stones. $#(Choice C)#  High fluid intake prevents supersaturation of urine with stone-forming ingredients.  Low fluid intake increases the urinary concentration of these ions regardless of their absolute amounts, promoting stone formation. $#(Choice D)#  Excessive oxalate intake (eg, chocolate, spinach, rhubarb) leads to increased intestinal absorption of free oxalate, which is then excreted in the urine where it promotes formation of calcium oxalate stones.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient with an extensive #smoking history,# 4.5-kg weight loss, painless hematuria, hypercalcemia, and renal mass likely has #renal cell carcinoma# (RCC).  RCC originates in the renal cortex and accounts for up to 90% of primary renal tumors.  It is often identified incidentally on radiographic imaging, and many individuals remain #asymptomatic# until the disease is relatively advanced.  Hematuria is the most common symptom, and #painless hematuria# in an older adult should raise suspicion for a genitourinary malignancy.  Patients may also have flank pain and a palpable abdominal mass at the time of presentation. $Paraneoplastic syndromes are common in RCC due to the secretion of biologically active substances by the tumor cells.  #Hypercalcemia# is frequently seen due to increased production of parathyroid hormone–related peptide or overproduction of prostaglandins that promote bony resorption.  #Erythrocytosis# due to ectopic erythropoietin production may also be seen. $#(Choice A)#  Bladder cancer is another common cause of hematuria and weight loss; however, CT scan would demonstrate a @bladder mass@.  This malignancy tends to metastasize to the liver, bones, and lungs.  Although hypercalcemia may occur occasionally, it is more strongly associated with RCC. $#(Choice B)#  Pheochromocytoma can cause severe, episodic hypertension associated with headaches, anxiety, palpitations, and sweating.  A CT scan would reveal a @suprarenal mass@, and urine catecholamines and metanephrine would likely be elevated.  Hematuria is not seen. $#(Choice C)#  Polycystic kidney disease can cause hematuria; however, flank pain is common, and imaging would show @bilateral renal cysts@, not a unilateral mass.  In addition, weight loss and hypercalcemia would be unexpected. $#(Choice D)#  Prostate cancer typically presents with discrete nodules or asymmetric induration of the prostate on digital rectal examination.  Diffuse, symmetric enlargement and firmness of the prostate are more suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia. $#(Choice F)#  Ureterolithiasis is a common cause of hematuria, and patients with hypercalcemia from other causes (eg, hyperparathyroidism) are predisposed to stone formation.  However, ureterolithiasis would not explain this patient's large, heterogeneous renal mass and unintended weight loss (which are highly suggestive of malignancy). $#Educational objective# Classic signs and symptoms of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) include hematuria, an abdominal mass, flank pain, and weight loss.  Hypercalcemia and erythrocytosis are common paraneoplastic syndromes associated with RCC.  ",

  "explanation_2": "$This patient developed acute kidney injury after taking ibuprofen.  #Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs# (NSAIDs) (eg, ibuprofen, aspirin, naproxen) exert their anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic effects through the inhibition of the cyclooxygenase enzymes.  These enzymes are the rate-limiting step in the formation of prostanoids (ie, prostaglandins, thromboxane), which are involved in mediating pain and inflammation. $Prostaglandins also help maintain renal perfusion by dilating the afferent arteriole, particularly in patients with intravascular volume depletion (eg, congestive heart failure, diarrhea, excessive diuresis) or chronic kidney disease.  In such patients, #increased prostaglandin synthesis# is necessary to #preserve renal blood flow# and maintain glomerular filtration rate.

Prolonged NSAID use can cause chronic kidney disease (analgesic nephropathy) due to papillary necrosis and chronic interstitial nephritis. $#(Choice B)#  Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system results in efferent arteriole constriction, and ACE inhibitors (eg, lisinopril) cause efferent vasodilation.  These medications can cause acute kidney injury, particularly in patients with volume depletion or bilateral renal artery stenosis.

However, urinalysis would demonstrate muddy-brown, granular casts, and NSAIDs are not commonly associated with ATN. $#(Choice E)#  Vasculitis involving the glomerular capillaries (eg, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis) causes a nephritic syndrome; urinalysis would demonstrate red blood cells and red blood cell casts.  In addition, patients with vasculitides typically have associated systemic symptoms (eg, fever, fatigue, weight loss). $#Educational objective# Patients with intravascular volume depletion (eg, congestive heart failure, diarrhea, excessive diuresis) and chronic kidney disease depend on renal prostaglandin production to dilate the afferent glomerular arteriole and maintain the glomerular filtration rate.

HSP is caused by the deposition of #IgA immune complexes# in small-vessel walls and may be precipitated by an upper respiratory tract infection, as seen in this patient. $HSP renal disease is an immune-mediated glomerulonephritis with microscopic features identical to @IgA nephropathy@: $• #Mesangial deposition# of IgA immune complexes triggers #mesangial cell proliferation# and extracellular matrix deposition, primarily via enhanced expression of platelet-derived growth factor and transforming growth factor beta. $• IgA Immune complexes also trigger #complement activation# via the alternative and lectin pathways; hydrolyzed complement proteins (eg, c5a) act as chemokines that attract #neutrophils#, which produce oxidants and release proteases (eg, elastase) that are damaging to glomerular capillaries. $• Macrophages may also be recruited to the glomerulus, where they cause further damage to glomerular capillaries, promote #fibrin deposition#, and contribute to #crescent formation# in severe cases. $Most children with HSP-related renal disease have mild nephritis characterized by #hematuria#, red blood cell (RBC) casts, non–nephrotic range proteinuria, and a normal creatinine.  However, severe complications (eg, nephrotic syndrome, acute kidney injury) can occur. $#(Choice A)#  IgG autoantibodies to phospholipase A2 receptor on podocytes can lead to subepithelial immune deposition and membranous nephropathy.  Patients have nephrotic syndrome (eg, edema, marked proteinuria [usually ≥3+]), not hematuria. $#(Choice B)#  Anti-glomerular basement membrane disease is caused by an autoantibody to the alpha 3 chain of type IV collagen and is often associated with pulmonary hemorrhage.  Although patients have nephritic syndrome with hematuria and RBC casts, arthralgias and purpura are not seen. $#(Choice D)#  Prothrombotic conditions (eg, antiphospholipid syndrome) can cause thrombosis of the glomerular capillaries, and urinalysis may show hematuria and/or proteinuria.  Although purpura may occur due to consumptive thrombocytopenia, the lesions would be diffuse, not localized to the lower extremities (immune complex vasculitis tends to affect dependent areas of the skin).  In addition, his recent upper respiratory tract infection is more characteristic of HSP. $#(Choice E)#  In rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, activated T lymphocytes secrete cytokines that stimulate macrophage activity, a process that contributes to crescent formation.  However, T lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity is not a mechanism of glomerular injury in HSP. $#Educational objective# Henoch-Schönlein purpura is an IgA-mediated, leukocytoclastic vasculitis that presents with palpable purpura, arthralgia/arthritis, abdominal pain, and/or hematuria.  Renal involvement is due to mesangial deposition of IgA immune complexes with subsequent mesangial cell proliferation, neutrophilic infiltration, and glomerular damage. ",

Subsequent activation of the complement cascade leads to neutrophil recruitment and inflammatory damage to the glomeruli. $#(Choices A and E)#  Cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes and macrophages play a prominent role in type IV (delayed-type) hypersensitivity reactions.  These cells are stimulated by T-helper cells, leading to localized inflammation, cellular destruction, and (often) granuloma formation.  Although certain forms of acute interstitial nephritis are due to type IV hypersensitivity, gross hematuria is uncommon and affected patients classically present with fever, rash, and eosinophilia. $#(Choice B)#  Histamine is released by mast cells and basophils during type I (immediate) hypersensitivity, which is seen with anaphylaxis and allergies, not PSGN.  Mast cells and basophils are coated by IgE molecules, which cross-link on antigen exposure, triggering the release of histamine and other mediators. $#(Choice C)#  Direct binding of autoantibodies to tissue is responsible for type II (cytotoxic) hypersensitivity reactions.

Blockade of Na+ and Cl− reabsorption from the tubular lumen decreases the medullary concentration gradient, impairing the kidney's ability to concentrate urine and increasing the overall excretion of Na+, Cl−, and H2O.

However, antimuscarinics often act on several types of muscarinic receptors and should be used with caution, especially in elderly patients and those with cognitive impairment due to medication adverse effects (eg, decreased cognition, blurred vision, drowsiness). $#(Choice A)#  Alpha-1 blockers (eg, doxazosin, prazosin, terazosin) are used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and hypertension.  They relax the smooth muscle in arterial and venous walls, leading to decreased peripheral vascular resistance, and also relax the smooth muscle in the bladder neck and prostate, leading to decreased urinary obstruction in patients with BPH. $#(Choices B and D)#  Beta-1 adrenergic receptors are found in cardiac tissue and on renal juxtaglomerular cells.  Selective beta-1 blockers (eg, metoprolol) decrease heart rate and contractility and block catecholamine-induced renin release by the kidney. $#(Choice C)#  In contrast to beta-3 adrenergic receptor agonists, antagonists would cause increased bladder spasms (ie, contractions) and increased urine loss. $#(Choice F)#  Muscarinic receptor activation leads to contractions of the bladder musculature and promotes bladder emptying.  Cholinergic agonists (eg, bethanechol) are used to treat urinary retention or neurogenic bladder by strengthening muscular contractions.  These medications would worsen this patient's symptoms. $#Educational objective# Urgency incontinence, or overactive bladder, is caused by uninhibited bladder contractions (detrusor instability) that results in a sudden urge to void followed by an involuntary loss of urine.  Treatment with beta-3 adrenergic receptor activation (eg, mirabegron) relaxes the detrusor muscle, promotes urine storage, and decreases incontinent episodes.  "

The apical membrane of early distal tubule cells contains the Na+/Cl- symporter while the basolateral side has Na+/K+ ATPases and Cl- channels that maintain a NaCl gradient across the apical cell membrane.  Thiazides inhibit the apical Na+/Cl- symporter, decreasing luminal NaCl absorption into the distal tubular cell.  This can cause hypercalcemia by reducing intracellular Na+ concentrations, which in turn increases the activity of the basolateral Na+-Ca2+ exchanger.  The resulting reduction in intracellular Ca2+ levels acts to increase luminal Ca2+ absorption in the distal tubule.  Increased Ca2+ absorption in the proximal tubule secondary to volume depletion can also contribute to hypercalcemia in thiazide-treated patients. $There are a number of thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics available.  Examples include hydrochlorothiazide, chlorothiazide, indapamide, and metolazone.  They differ in potency, bioavailability, and half-life.  Thiazides are not as efficacious as loop diuretics as only a small amount of filtered Na reaches the distal tubules.  They are used to treat edema secondary to heart failure, renal disease, and liver disease.  Thiazides are also commonly used to treat hypertension.

Microalbuminuria cannot be detected by standard dipstick urinalysis; only albumin excretion >300 mg/day (severely increased albuminuria) can be detected by conventional urinalysis.  If left untreated, albuminuria is followed by progressive worsening of renal function leading to end-stage renal disease. $The progression of DN can be reduced by #glycemic and blood pressure control#.  In addition, progression can be slowed by use of #ACE inhibitors# (eg, lisinopril) or angiotensin II receptor blockers.  Early DN is characterized by elevated glomerular filtration pressure; angiotensin II further increases glomerular pressure by selective vasoconstriction of the efferent arteriole.  Blockade of this angiotensin effect #lowers glomerular pressure#.  Although ACE inhibitors decrease glomerular filtration in the short term, chronic use decreases albumin excretion and slows progression to overt renal failure.  This benefit is independent of effects on systemic blood pressure and can also be seen in nonhypertensive patients. $#(Choice A)#  Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, diltiazem, verapamil) decrease proteinuria, but this effect is not seen with dihydropyridine agents (eg, amlodipine, nifedipine).  Although blood pressure control is important in patients with diabetes, lisinopril is more beneficial for preventing progression of nephropathy. $#(Choices B and C)#  Carvedilol is a nonselective beta- and alpha-adrenergic blocker used in hypertension and congestive heart failure.  Eplerenone is a mineralocorticoid (aldosterone) antagonist that is also used in congestive heart failure.  These agents have no specific role in the management of DN. $#(Choice D)#  Hydrochlorothiazide is an effective antihypertensive agent.  However, it also causes hyperglycemia and may be associated with worsened glucose control in diabetic patients.  ACE inhibitors are preferred over thiazides for first-line treatment. $#(Choice E)#  Isosorbide dinitrate is an intermediate-acting nitrate used in the treatment of stable angina pectoris.  It has no role in the management of DN. $#(Choice G)#  Alpha-1 blockers (eg, doxazosin, prazosin, terazosin) are useful for treatment of hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia but are not recommended as monotherapy for hypertension due to an increased risk of cardiovascular events. $#Educational objective# The risk of progression of diabetic nephropathy in patients with proteinuria can be reduced by appropriate glycemic and blood pressure control.  ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers are the preferred antihypertensive agents due to their antiproteinuric effects, which are independent from their effects on systemic blood pressure.

  "explanation_2": "#Loop diuretics# (eg, furosemide) are sometimes abused by patients with eating disorders (eg, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa) in an effort to lose weight.  These drugs #inhibit the Na+-K+-2Cl−# #transporter# in the loop of Henle, resulting in increased urinary excretion of Na+, Cl−, K+, and water.  These changes in electrolyte handling also increase renal H+ excretion, leading to #metabolic alkalosis# (elevated serum HCO3−).  Overuse of loop diuretics leads to massive electrolyte and fluid losses with #intravascular volume depletion# and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.  This secondary hyperaldosteronism stimulates increased Na+ reabsorption in the renal tubular collecting duct, as well as a lesser degree of passive Cl− reabsorption.  The relatively high loss of Cl− that occurs is responsible for a #characteristic hypochloremia#. $Secondary hyperaldosteronism also stimulates increased K+ and H+ excretion in the @collecting duct@, exacerbating the #hypokalemia# and metabolic alkalosis.  The alkalosis is further compounded by an angiotensin II-mediated increase in proximal tubule sodium bicarbonate reabsorption.  #Chloride depletion# then #perpetuates the alkalosis# because low Cl− levels in the tubular lumen impair HCO3− excretion via the pendrin Cl−/HCO3− exchanger on @beta intercalated cells@ in the collecting duct. $The #urine electrolyte# findings in loop diuretic abuse depend on how recently the medication was last ingested.  Within several hours after ingestion (as in this patient with positive urine screening), #increased urine Na+, Cl−, and K+# is expected.  Once the medication effect wears off, urine Na+ and urine Cl- are low as the kidneys attempt to increase blood volume.  Urine K+ is likely to remain increased due to ongoing aldosterone-mediated losses #(choice C).# $#(Choices B, D, and E)#  Because Cl− and HCO3− are the most abundant anions in the body, they are the primary determinants of total body electronegativity.  Therefore, when one of these anions is depleted the kidneys and intestines retain the other to maintain electronegative balance.  This results in a typical inverse relationship between serum Cl− and serum HCO3− levels (when one is low the other tends to be elevated).  The presence of additional anions in the body (eg, anion gap metabolic acidosis) may disrupt this relationship. $#Educational objective# Overuse or abuse of loop diuretics (eg, furosemide) characteristically causes hypokalemic, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis.  Urine electrolyte findings depend on how recently the diuretic was last ingested; increased urine Na+, Cl−, and K+ are expected with recent ingestion.  ",

In conjunction with his bilateral #abdominal bruits# (abnormal sound caused by turbulent blood flow), this presentation suggests renovascular hypertension from #bilateral renal artery stenosis# (RAS).  Although RAS can be caused by a variety of lesions (eg, fibromuscular dysplasia in young women), >90% of cases are caused by atherosclerotic narrowing of the proximal renal artery.  Therefore, it is most common in older patients with other atherosclerotic disease (eg, carotid stenosis, as in this patient) or risk factors (eg, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, smoking). $Decreased renal artery perfusion activates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.  The juxtaglomerular cells increase secretion of #renin#, which converts angiotensinogen to angiotensin I.  Angiotensin I is then converted to angiotensin II by angiotensin-converting enzyme.  #Angiotensin II#, a potent vasoconstrictor, causes increased peripheral resistance and elevated systemic blood pressure.  In addition, it stimulates the secretion of #aldosterone#, which increases renal Na+ reabsorption and K+ and H+ excretion, resulting in relative #hypokalemia# and metabolic alkalosis. $#Educational objective# Renal artery stenosis (eg, severe hypertension, abdominal bruits) causes decreased renal artery perfusion, which activates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.  Increased secretion of renin leads to increased production of angiotensin I and angiotensin II, which causes increased peripheral resistance and elevated systemic blood pressure.  Increased aldosterone secretion causes increased renal Na+ reabsorption and K+ and H+ excretion, resulting in relative hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis.  "

  "explanation_2": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (typically named \"-pril\") are one of the most important agents in treating hypertension, heart failure, and renal failure with or without proteinuria.  They work by preventing the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II.  This prevents the efferent arteriole from constricting more than the afferent arteriole, thus decreasing the glomerular pressure and glomerular filtration rate (GFR).  It is expected for the GFR to decrease in all patients initially.  Most clinicians are generally not concerned by this unless the creatinine increases by greater than 30% because the long-term benefits of ACE inhibitors are well studied.  Other common side-effects of ACE inhibitors include hyperkalemia and cough. $#(Choice B)#  Metoprolol is a beta-blocker.  Typical side-effects include bradycardia and erectile dysfunction.  Although beta blockers act upon the beta-1 receptors of the juxtaglomerular cells to reduce renin secretion, their use generally does not have a clinically significant effect on the GFR. $#(Choice C)#  Atorvastatin is an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor; worrisome side-effects include muscle toxicity and hepatic dysfunction.  Statins can uncommonly cause rhabdomyolysis, particularly when used in combination with fibrates or cyclosporin.  However, massive rhabdomyolysis leading to acute kidney injury would most likely produce additional signs and symptoms such as myalgias, muscle weakness, dark urine, and elevated creatine kinase. $#(Choices D and E)#  Hydrochlorothiazide is a potassium-wasting thiazide diuretic that may decrease GFR if it results in volume depletion and pre-renal azotemia.  Furosemide is also potassium-wasting loop diuretic. $#(Choice F)#  Metformin itself does not have nephrotoxic side effects.  However, impaired renal function or recent IV contrast administration may reduce metformin excretion, resulting in systemic accumulation and possible lactic acidosis. $#(Choice G)#  Prazosin is an alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist that is used in the treatment of hypertension.  It does not decrease the GFR. $#Educational objective# Common side-effects of ACE-inhibitors include decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR), hyperkalemia, and cough.

  "explanation_2": "$The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is one of the most important neurohormonal systems, regulating arterial blood pressure and sodium and fluid content in the body.  In response to decreased sodium, fluid volume, or arterial blood pressure, renin is released from the kidneys, converting angiotensinogen to angiotensin I.  Subsequently, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II.  Angiotensin II then increases aldosterone secretion from the adrenal cortex, leading to increased sodium and fluid retention in the collecting tubules of the kidneys.  Angiotensin II is also a potent vasoconstrictor that ultimately increases systemic vascular resistance and arterial pressure. $Angiotensin II itself is involved in 2 negative feedback mechanisms that help regulate the RAAS.  In short-loop negative feedback, elevated angiotensin II stimulates the angiotensin receptors on juxtaglomerular cells to inhibit renin release.  In long-loop negative feedback, increased blood pressure and sodium levels (due to angiotensin II) eventually decrease renin release via intrarenal baroreceptor and macula densa pathways, respectively. $#ACE inhibitors# such as ramipril block ACE and decrease the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, effectively blocking arteriolar vasoconstriction and aldosterone secretion.  In addition to decreased blood pressure and sodium levels, #decreased angiotensin II# levels also interfere with negative feedback mechanisms, ultimately activating the RAAS to #promote renin release#.  @ACE@ is also responsible for the breakdown of bradykinin; therefore, ACE inhibitors lead to i#ncreased bradykinin #levels, which are thought to cause the characteristic ACE inhibitor–induced cough. $#Educational objective# Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors block the effect of ACE, decreasing angiotensin II and aldosterone levels.  By decreasing angiotensin II levels, ACE inhibitors directly interrupt negative feedback loops, thereby increasing renin and angiotensin I levels.

  "explanation_2": "#Hypokalemia# is a common medical condition that can result from several mechanisms, including decreased oral intake, renal or gastrointestinal loss, and increased entry into cells.  In a patient receiving multiple doses of albuterol, the most likely etiology is #intracellular shift of potassium#. $Potassium is primarily stored intracellularly (~98% of total body stores) through the action of the #Na-K-ATPase pump#, which exchanges sodium for potassium against their concentration gradient.  The large concentration difference of intracellular (~150 mEq/L) to extracellular potassium (~4 mEq/L) is a major driver of the resting membrane potential.  Alterations in this ratio can impair action potential generation, explaining why patients with marked hyper- or hypokalemia can develop muscular weakness and cardiac arrhythmias. $#Beta-adrenergic activity# increases the activity of the Na-K-ATPase pump; therefore, both endogenous catecholamines and therapeutic beta-2 agonists (eg, #albuterol#, dobutamine) can cause #transient hypokalemia# due to increased #transport of potassium intracellularly#.  Similar effects can also occur with sympathomimetics (eg, pseudoephedrine) and insulin, which also increase Na-K-ATPase activity. $#(Choice A)#  Decreased oral intake of potassium is a rare cause of hypokalemia.  Because the kidneys can lower potassium excretion in the setting of reduced potassium intake, most patients do not develop hypokalemia unless fasting is prolonged (eg, starvation). $#(Choice B)#  Respiratory acidosis may occur as a complication of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease due to CO2 retention; however, acidosis causes potassium to shift to the extracellular space, leading to hyperkalemia (not hypokalemia).  In contrast, alkalosis causes intracellular shift of potassium, resulting in transient hypokalemia. $#(Choice C)#  Significant diaphoresis (eg, marathon running in a hot climate) can result in potassium depletion.  However, normal sweating (as could occur in patients with increased work of breathing) would not result in significant potassium loss. $#(Choice D)#  Increased urinary potassium loss can occur due to diuretic use or elevated aldosterone levels (eg, renovascular disease, primary hyperaldosteronism).  While beta-1 agonists can result in increased renin release (leading to elevated aldosterone levels and increased renal potassium loss), beta-2 agonists (eg, albuterol) do not have a significant effect on urinary potassium excretion. $#Educational objective# Potassium is primarily stored intracellularly (~98% of total body stores) through the action of the Na-K-ATPase pump.

Patients with excessive ADH activity (ie, SIADH) typically have the following manifestations: $• Serum sodium and osmolality decrease, leading to #hypotonic hyponatremia#. $• Urinary water excretion decreases, increasing urine osmolality and creating a #concentrated urine#. $• #Clinical euvolemia#, which is reflected by an absence of edema, lung crackles, and jugular venous distention (signs of hypervolemia) along with absence of dry mucous membranes and elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (signs of hypovolemia). $In this case, the patient's SIADH is likely due to #carbamazepine#, an antiepileptic drug that induces ADH production and increases renal sensitivity to ADH.  Other medications associated with SIADH include antidepressants (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants), certain antidiabetic drugs (eg, chlorpropamide), and recreational drugs (eg, MDMA [ie, ecstasy]). $#(Choice A)#  Canagliflozin is a diabetic medication that inhibits sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 in the renal proximal tubule, increasing urinary glucose excretion.  Canagliflozin is linked to urinary tract infections and hypotension, but not SIADH. $#(Choices C and E)#  Furosemide and spironolactone are often used in combination to treat severe heart failure.  Furosemide reduces sodium reabsorption in the loop of Henle, increasing sodium and water excretion.  Spironolactone blocks the mineralocorticoid receptor, which increases sodium excretion and potassium reabsorption.  Both diuretics can induce hyponatremia; however, patients are typically also hypovolemic (eg, with dry mucous membranes and elevated BUN and creatinine).  This patient's euvolemia and normal BUN and creatinine are more consistent with SIADH. $#(Choice D)#  Lithium can cause ADH resistance in the renal collecting ducts, resulting in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.  In this condition, water cannot be reabsorbed; urine osmolality is low (dilute urine) and serum sodium and osmolality increase.  This patient has an opposite picture (high urine osmolality, low serum sodium and osmolality), indicating SIADH. $#Educational objective# The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) presents with hypotonic hyponatremia (ie, low serum osmolality and serum sodium), concentrated urine (ie, high urine osmolality), and euvolemia.  Carbamazepine can cause SIADH by increasing antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion and renal sensitivity to ADH.  ",

Aldosterone then acts on the collecting tubule to enhance Na+ reabsorption and promote K+ and H+ loss.  Therefore,# loop and thiazide diuretics# cause #hypokalemia# and #metabolic alkalosis #secondary to volume contraction. $Loop diuretics function by inhibiting the absorption of solutes within the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop, a process that is critical for maintenance of the corticomedullary concentration gradient.  As a result, patients on loop diuretics are unable to maximally concentrate their urine and thus lose substantial amounts of both salt and water in the urine.

  "explanation_2": "$The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is the most important neurohormonal system regulating sodium/fluid balance and arterial blood pressure in the body.  Regulation of the RAAS involves 3 major components: macula densa (distal tubule sodium sensor), intrarenal baroreceptors, and beta-adrenergic receptors.  Beta-adrenergic regulation is mediated through sympathetic stimulation of #beta-1 receptors# located on juxtaglomerular cells, which stimulate the release of renin. $#Beta-adrenergic antagonists# inhibit renin release, which in turn reduces the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I and reduces the levels of angiotensin II and aldosterone.  This effect on the RAAS is only partially responsible for beta blocker effects on blood pressure, and antihypertensive efficacy of beta blockers weakly correlates with plasma renin levels.  Beta blockers have no effect on ACE activity and, therefore, do not affect bradykinin levels. $#(Choice B)#  Direct renin inhibitors (aliskiren) block the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which leads to reduced levels of angiotensin I and II and aldosterone.  Plasma renin concentration is increased via suppression of the inhibitory feedback loop. $#(Choices C and D)#  ACE inhibitors prevent the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II and lead to decreased levels of angiotensin II and aldosterone, along with increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin I levels via inhibition of negative feedback.  ACE is also a kininase and normally degrades bradykinin in the body.  Therefore, ACE inhibitors lead to increased levels of bradykinin, which is responsible for the coughing seen in treated patients. $#(Choice E)#  Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) block the action of angiotensin II on angiotensin (AT1) receptors, which leads to increased levels of renin and angiotensin I and II.  ARBs have no effect on bradykinin levels. $#(Choice F)#  Aldosterone antagonists (spironolactone, eplerenone) compete with aldosterone for the receptor sites in the distal tubules.  They raise the levels of renin, angiotensin I and II, and aldosterone via inhibition of negative feedback. $#Educational objective# Beta-adrenergic blocking drugs inhibit renin release by blocking beta-1 receptor-mediated regulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.  This reduces plasma renin activity, with a resulting reduction in angiotensin I, angiotensin II, and aldosterone levels."

This causes a sudden sensation of urgency, with involuntary leakage of urine often occurring before reaching the toilet. $Pharmacologic therapy with #anticholinergic drugs# is useful for treating the condition.  These agents (eg, oxybutynin) antagonize muscarinic receptors, primarily the #M3 receptors# present on smooth muscle cells in the bladder.  Antagonism of M3 receptors decreases the production of IP3 and the release of calcium, leading to smooth muscle relaxation.  This causes #decreased involuntary detrusor contractions#, increased bladder capacity, and decreased sense of urgency. $Antimuscarinic agents often act on several types of muscarinic receptors and should be used with caution, especially in elderly patients.  These agents should be started at the lowest possible dose and titrated as needed to minimize anticholinergic side effects (dry mouth, blurred vision, tachycardia, drowsiness, and constipation). $#(Choice A)#  Alpha1-blockers such as doxazosin, prazosin and terazosin are useful for the treatment of both benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and hypertension.  They cause relaxation of the smooth muscle in arterial and venous walls, leading to a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance.  In patients with BPH, they also induce relaxation of the smooth muscle in the bladder neck and prostate, leading to a decrease in urinary obstruction. $#(Choice B)#  Beta-1 receptors are found in cardiac tissue and on renal juxtaglomerular cells.  Selective beta-1 blockers (eg, metoprolol) decrease heart rate and contractility, and block catecholamine-induced renin release by the kidney. $#(Choice D)#  Nicotinic cholinergic receptors are found on postganglionic neurons in sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia and on skeletal muscle cells at the neuromuscular junction.  Drugs that block skeletal muscle nicotinic receptors, such as tubocurarine, are often used during general anesthesia to induce paralysis. $#(Choice E)#  Central sympatholytics such as methyldopa and clonidine stimulate alpha-2 receptors centrally, which causes a decrease in generalized sympathetic outflow and a decrease in blood pressure.  Rebound hypertension is a concern with abrupt cessation. $#(Choice F)#  Beta-2 adrenergic receptors are located in the smooth muscle of airways, peripheral vasculature, and uterus.  Stimulation of these receptors causes bronchodilation, vasodilation, and tocolysis, respectively.  In contrast, bladder relaxation is mediated primarily by beta-3 adrenergic receptors. $#Educational objective# Urge incontinence, or overactive bladder syndrome, is caused by uninhibited bladder contractions (detrusor instability).  It results in a sense of urgency accompanied by an involuntary loss of urine.

Hyperphosphatemia is thought to be the inciting event in the onset of CKD-related mineral bone disorder.  Elevated blood phosphate triggers the release of fibroblast growth factor 23 from bone, which lowers calcitriol production and intestinal calcium absorption.  Reduced circulating calcium, along with hyperphosphatemia, leads to secondary hyperparathyroidism. $Dietary phosphorus restriction is recommended for patients with CKD.  However, oral #phosphate binders# are usually needed if dietary restriction is not sufficient to lower phosphate levels.  Phosphate binders can be calcium containing (eg, calcium carbonate/acetate) or non–calcium containing (eg, sevelamer, lanthanum).  #Sevelamer# is a #nonabsorbable anion-exchange resin# that binds intestinal phosphate to #reduce systemic absorption#.  The resulting complex is eliminated in the feces. $#(Choice A)#  Vitamin D receptor antagonists are largely experimental compounds that have been considered for the treatment of Paget disease of bone.  Most patients with CKD benefit from vitamin D supplementation due to decreased renal formation of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. $#(Choices C, D, and F)#  Parathyroid hormone induces internalization and destruction of type IIa sodium/phosphate cotransporters (NPT2) in the proximal renal tubule.  NPT2 gene expression is downregulated by fibroblast growth factor 23.  These processes lead to decreased transcellular transport (and therefore decreased reabsorption) of phosphate in the renal tubules. $#(Choice E)#  Parathyroid hormone functions to reduce phosphate reabsorption by the kidney; reduced secretion would worsen, not correct, hyperphosphatemia.  Sevelamer reduces circulating serum phosphorus by blocking intestinal absorption, which helps to mitigate secondary hyperparathyroidism. $#Educational objective# Chronic kidney disease can cause hyperphosphatemia due to decreased renal excretion of phosphorus.

  "explanation_1": "",
  "explanation_2": "This patient's presentation is consistent with #urge incontinence#, which is due to detrusor overactivity causing a sudden and/or frequent urge to urinate and empty the bladder.  The micturition reflex is an autonomic spinal reflex mediated by both sensory and motor fibers from nerve centers at the S2-S4 levels.  Parasympathetic stimulation causes detrusor muscle contraction and internal urethral sphincter relaxation.  Sympathetic fibers cause internal sphincter contraction and also help with sensing a full bladder. $Multiple sclerosis (MS) is likely an autoimmune disease that causes varying degrees of demyelination, inflammation, and gliosis in the central nervous system (eg, optic nerves, spinal cord, brainstem, periventricular white matter, and cerebellum).  Regions in the pons and cerebral cortex partially inhibit the micturition reflex and also regulate contraction/relaxation of the external urethral sphincter.  Spinal cord lesions above the sacral region cause a loss of higher center control of micturition and lead to detrusor hyperreflexia and urge incontinence.  Patients typically develop a frequent urge to urinate and pass a small amount of urine.  As the disease progresses, the bladder can become atonic and dilated leading to overflow incontinence. $#(Choice A)#  Overflow incontinence can be due to impaired detrusor contractility or bladder outlet obstruction (eg, tumor obstructing urethra).  Patients usually develop involuntary and continuous urinary leakage when the bladder is full and often have incomplete emptying.  Post-void residual urine volume is usually high. $#(Choice B)#  Osmotic diuresis due to hyperglycemia can occur in uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and causes polyuria.  However, it more commonly occurs with blood sugar >250 mg/dL.  This patient's blood sugar of 160 mg/dL and absence of glycosuria make this less likely. $#(Choice C)#  Bladder infection (cystitis) can cause irritation of the bladder wall and findings similar to urge incontinence with urinary urgency, frequency, and incontinence.  However, this patient's relatively normal urinalysis (no leukocyte esterase, hematuria, or bacteria seen) makes this less likely.  Up to 5 wbc/hpf is normal.  $#(Choice D)#  Stress incontinence occurs in patients with sphincter dysfunction or weakness when intraabdominal pressure exceeds the urethral sphincter pressure (eg, sneezing, coughing), causing involuntary urine leakage.  This patient's absence of urinary leakage with coughing or sneezing makes this less likely. $#Educational objective# Patients with multiple sclerosis most commonly develop urge incontinence due to loss of central nervous system inhibition of detrusor contraction in the bladder.  As the disease progresses, the bladder can become atonic and dilated, leading to overflow incontinence.  "

The GFR is the volume of fluid filtered from the renal glomerular capillaries into the Bowman capsule per unit of time.  The RPF is the volume of plasma delivered to the kidney per unit of time.  The #filtration fraction# (FF) is the ratio of GFR to RPF (FF = GFR/RPF).  On average, approximately one-fifth of the plasma that passes through the glomerular capillaries is filtered into the Bowman capsule. $This patient is severely hypovolemic due to profuse diarrhea and vomiting.  The decline in circulating blood volume is sensed by arterial and cardiac baroreceptors and triggers increased systemic arteriolar vasoconstriction.  Renal vasoconstriction further lowers the RPF, which is already decreased due to the decline in circulating blood volume.  Decreased RPF causes glomerular perfusion pressure to drop, lowering the GFR and reducing #distal tubule sodium delivery#.  This stimulates secretion of renin and increased #angiotensin II# production.  Angiotensin II preferentially constricts the efferent glomerular arteriole, which increases hydrostatic pressure in the glomerular capillaries to maintain GFR (#autoregulation#).  Due to this compensatory mechanism, the decrease in GFR is less pronounced than the decrease in RPF, resulting in an increased FF #(choices B, C, and E)#.  As RPF continues to decline, increasing glomerular oncotic pressure will eventually overwhelm the compensatory increase in hydrostatic pressure, leading to a precipitous drop in GFR and subsequent renal failure. $#(Choice D)#  Autoregulation improves but often cannot completely normalize the GFR in the setting of decreased renal perfusion pressure.  If the net GFR were increased above normal, it would result in decreased renin formation and loss of the angiotensin II-driven arteriolar constriction required to maintain it. $#Educational objective# Hypovolemia results in a reduced renal plasma flow (RPF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR).

Elevated serum calcium inhibits the release of parathyroid hormone (PTH) from parathyroid cells, which has several downstream effects including: $• #Hypercalciuria# – low PTH levels increase urinary calcium excretion due to reduced calcium reabsorption in the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the kidney (where PTH exerts its effects) $• #Low 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D levels# – low PTH (and renal insufficiency) reduce the activity of renal 1-alpha-hydroxylase, the enzyme that converts 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (the more active form) $Therefore, patients with MM classically have low PTH and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels and elevated urinary calcium. $#(Choice A)#  Thiazide diuretics cause hypercalcemia by promoting calcium reabsorption in the @distal convoluted tubule@.  This leads to reduced urinary calcium excretion and low serum PTH levels (elevated serum calcium reduces PTH release).  Angiotensin receptor blockers (eg, valsartan) do not increase renal calcium reabsorption. $#(Choice B)#  Granulomatous diseases (eg, sarcoidosis, tuberculosis) can cause hypercalcemia due to production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D by 1-alpha-hydroxylase in granulomatous tissue.  This increases the intestinal absorption and urinary excretion of calcium (the latter effect being caused by concomitant suppression of PTH). $#(Choice C)#  Production of PTH-related protein (PTHrP) is the most common cause of hypercalcemia in malignancy (eg, squamous cell carcinoma).  PTHrP increases osteoclast activity and renal calcium absorption with minimal effect on 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.  The hypercalcemia seen in MM is not typically due to PTHrP; it is caused by osteolytic cytokines. $#(Choice E)#  Primary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by excessive PTH release, leading to increased bone resorption and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D formation.  Urinary calcium excretion is elevated due to the increased filtered calcium load (despite the increased renal reabsorption induced by PTH). $#(Choice F)#  Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is caused by inactivating mutations of the Ca2+-sensing receptor in the nephron and parathyroid glands.  Renal calcium reabsorption is increased (urinary calcium excretion is low) and higher serum calcium levels are required to suppress PTH release (serum PTH is slightly elevated or inappropriately normal). $#Educational objective# Multiple myeloma is associated with increased bone resorption due to the production of tumor-related cytokines.  This results in elevated serum calcium levels, which reduce parathyroid hormone (PTH) production.  Low PTH decreases renal calcium reabsorption (hypercalciuria), and, in combination with renal insufficiency, reduces 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D synthesis.  ",

  "explanation_2": "$This patient with #chronic kidney disease# (CKD) has developed carpal spasm secondary to hypocalcemia.  In CKD, reduced filtration and excretion of phosphorus causes #hyperphosphatemia#, which induces #hypocalcemia# through the following mechanisms: $• Released phosphate binds to free calcium and precipitates in soft tissues (which, over the long term, can lead to vascular calcification and stiffness) $• Increased serum phosphate triggers the release of fibroblast growth factor 23 from bone, which acts to lower phosphate levels in part by inhibiting renal expression of 1-alpha hydroxylase.  This reduces production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol), leading to reduced intestinal calcium absorption $Hypocalcemia is also worsened by the progressive loss of functioning renal tissue in CKD, which further reduces calcitriol synthesis. $Hypocalcemia can cause alterations in cellular membrane potentials and #neuromuscular excitability#.  Manifestations include muscle cramps, Chvostek (#facial twitching# elicited by tapping on the facial nerve) and Trousseau (#carpal spasm# triggered by inflation of a blood pressure cuff around the arm) @signs@, hyperreflexia, QTc prolongation, and seizures. $#(Choice B)#  The hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia that occur in patients with CKD stimulate secretion of parathyroid hormone (ie, secondary hyperparathyroidism).  By contrast, hypoparathyroidism is usually due to autoimmune disease or iatrogenic injury during thyroid surgery and is not a common finding in CKD. $#(Choice C)#  Serum calcium is composed of an ionized free calcium fraction and a protein-bound (largely to albumin) fraction; only ionized calcium is metabolically active.  Hypoalbuminemia can occur in patients with nephrotic syndrome (eg, this patient with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis).  However, although hypoalbuminemia lowers the bound fraction (and therefore total serum calcium), ionized calcium remains normal, and patients do not experience hypocalcemic symptoms. $#(Choice D)#  Fibroblast growth factor 23 levels are usually low in patients with normal phosphate metabolism but are increased in patients with renal failure in response to hyperphosphatemia. $#(Choice E)#  Vitamin D toxicity can occur in food faddists, patients with mental illness, and those inadvertently treated with excessive doses of vitamin D.  However, this causes hypercalcemia, not hypocalcemia. $#Educational objective# In chronic kidney disease, reduced excretion of phosphate can cause hyperphosphatemia.  This induces hypocalcemia directly by binding free calcium and depositing in tissues, and indirectly by triggering fibroblast growth factor 23 secretion (decreases calcitriol production and intestinal calcium absorption).  The resulting hypocalcemia can manifest as neuromuscular excitability (eg, carpal spasm).  ",

Mild hypercalcemia is usually due to benign causes (eg, primary hyperparathyroidism), but serum calcium >13 mg/dL suggests an underlying malignancy. $#Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy# (HHM) is the most common cause of hypercalcemia in patients with malignancy and is due to secretion of #parathyroid hormone-related peptide# (PTHrP) by malignant cells.

  "explanation_2": "This patient developed #reduced renal function# (ie, elevated creatinine) following hospitalization for acute pyelonephritis.  Her appetite loss (which often persists during recovery from illness and can be worsened by antibiotic use) likely resulted in #decreased oral intake# with subsequent hypovolemia and decreased renal perfusion. $Impaired renal function due to hypoperfusion is termed #prerenal #acute kidney injury (#AKI#), as the pathogenesis is driven by impaired renal blood flow; the kidneys are not actually injured and renal tubular function is intact.  In response to perceived hypovolemia, the @renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system@ (RAAS) becomes activated, and there is #increased reabsorption# of renal solutes (namely urea and sodium) and water in an effort to restore intravascular volume.  Expected laboratory findings include: $• #Increased ratio# of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) to creatinine (>20:1) (ie, #prerenal azotemia#) due to increased urea reabsorption $• #Low urine sodium# (<20 mEq/L) and low (<1%) fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) due to increased sodium reabsorption $• High urine osmolality (>450 mOsm/kg) and specific gravity (>1.015), in part due to @nonosmotic stimulation@ of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) with relatively greater reabsorption of water than solute $• #Unremarkable urinalysis# (eg, no protein, cells, or casts) due to lack of intrinsic kidney injury $Restoration of intravascular volume (eg, isotonic intravenous fluids) normalizes RAAS and ADH activity and resolves prerenal AKI. $#(Choice A)#  Chronic pyelonephritis can be a complication of repeated or untreated episodes of acute pyelonephritis.  However, urinalysis typically shows white blood cells (WBCs) and other evidence of kidney injury (eg, hematuria, proteinuria). $#(Choice B)#  Acute interstitial nephritis can occur following new medication exposure (eg, levofloxacin).  However, urinary WBCs and WBC casts are usually present, and laboratory findings are consistent with intrinsic kidney injury (eg, BUN/creatinine ratio ~10:1, FENa >2%). $#(Choice D)#  Renal artery stenosis is typically accompanied by underlying hypertension caused by chronic RAAS activation.  Patients are at risk for developing AKI after initiation of an ACE inhibitor. $#(Choice E)#  Untreated prerenal AKI can eventually lead to ischemic acute tubular necrosis.  However, muddy brown casts are commonly present, and laboratory findings are more consistent with intrinsic (rather than prerenal) kidney injury. $#(Choice F)#  Although common in older men due to urethral obstruction by an enlarged prostate, AKI due to urinary tract obstruction is relatively uncommon in women because it requires obstruction of both ureters (eg, advanced cervical cancer).  In addition, postrenal AKI usually demonstrates a BUN/creatinine ratio <20:1. $#Educational objective# Prerenal acute kidney injury results from renal hypoperfusion (eg, dehydration due to poor oral intake).  Characteristic laboratory findings include an elevated blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio (>20:1), low urine sodium (<20 mEq/L), low fractional excretion of sodium (<1%), high urine osmolality and specific gravity, and unremarkable urinalysis.

Signs of hypovolemia include dry skin with decreased turgor, dry mucous membranes, decreased urine output, and orthostatic hypotension. $Changes in blood volume or osmolality are detected by sensors in the carotid, hypothalamus, atria, and kidneys and result in activation of multiple compensatory mechanisms: $• Activation of the @renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system@ results in systemic vasoconstriction and increased aldosterone release.

Although long-standing PHPT causes thinning of cortical bone, the trabecular architecture remains relatively preserved. $#Educational objective# Increased bone resorption in primary hyperparathyroidism leads to osteoporosis primarily involving the cortical bone of the appendicular skeleton.  The cortical thinning appears radiologically as subperiosteal erosions.  More advanced disease can present as osteitis fibrosa cystica (ie, granular decalcification of the skull, osteolytic cysts, and brown tumors).  ",

  "explanation_2": "$This patient's arterial pH >7.45 is consistent with @alkalemia@.  The PaCO2 is elevated (>40 mm Hg), indicating a respiratory acidosis, which does not explain the alkalemia.  Therefore, #primary metabolic alkalosis with respiratory compensation# is most likely present.  When the etiology of metabolic alkalosis is unknown, assessment of #volume status# and measurement of #urine chloride# can be helpful. $Because low Cl- impairs @renal excretion of HCO3-@, total body #chloride depletion# often plays an important role in the pathogenesis of metabolic alkalosis.  Etiologies of metabolic alkalosis that involve temporary chloride depletion (#hypovolemia#) will demonstrate #low urine chloride# and are amenable to treatment with Cl- repletion (#saline responsive#).  These etiologies include: $• #Nasogastric suctioning# or #severe vomiting#, which involve loss of H+ and Cl- (ie, hydrochloric acid) from the stomach. $• #Loop or thiazide diuretic overuse#, which involve loss of Cl- and retention of HCO3- by the kidneys.  Of note, urine chloride will be high with recent use but drops to low levels once the diuretic effect wanes. $Metabolic alkalosis can also occur in the absence of significant chloride depletion.  Conditions of #mineralocorticoid excess# (eg, primary hyperaldosteronism) cause metabolic alkalosis primarily due to aldosterone-mediated H+ loss from the kidneys.  These patients have #hypervolemia #(eg, hypertension), resulting in a pressure natriuresis with #high urine chloride #levels; the metabolic alkalosis does not correct with Cl- repletion (#saline unresponsive#) due to the persistent mineralocorticoid effect. $Certain renal tubular channelopathies (eg, Bartter and Gitelman syndromes) represent a special case.  Although affected patients are hypovolemic and total body chloride is low, high urine chloride is present because the defect persistently impairs renal Cl- reabsorption. $#(Choices A and E)#  Assessment of serum ketones and urine glucose is helpful in the evaluation of diabetic ketoacidosis as a cause of metabolic acidosis.  However, this patient has metabolic alkalosis. $#(Choices B and C)#  Intravascular volume depletion can also contribute to metabolic alkalosis by increasing renal bicarbonate reabsorption.  However, serum sodium concentration is an indication of the relative amounts of total body sodium and total body water; it provides little information about overall volume status (ie, hypo- or hypernatremia can occur with hypovolemia, euvolemia, or hypervolemia).  Serum osmolality usually reflects serum sodium concentration unless high levels of other osmotically active substances are present (eg, glucose, ethanol); like serum sodium, it cannot be used to reliably differentiate hypovolemia from hypervolemia. $#Educational objective# Total body chloride depletion is often important in the pathophysiology of metabolic alkalosis.  Measurement of urine chloride can be helpful in determining the underlying etiology.  ",

The resulting #vitamin D deficiency# can present as rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. $Vitamin D increases intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorus; deficiency reduces calcium absorption, which in turn stimulates release of parathyroid hormone (PTH).  Vitamin D also directly inhibits PTH release, and therefore vitamin D deficiency facilitates a significant rise in PTH (secondary hyperparathyroidism).  PTH induces release of calcium and phosphorus from bones, leading to decreased bone mineralization.  (Although most phosphorus in the body is in the form of hydroxyapatite in bone, circulating phosphorus is primarily in the form of phosphate/phosphoric acids.) $Typical laboratory findings in vitamin D deficiency include: $• #low 25-hydroxyvitamin D#, which reflects total body vitamin D stores (PTH stimulates renal conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D; therefore, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D may remain within laboratory norms). $• #elevated PTH#. $• increased alkaline phosphatase, reflecting increased bone turnover. $• #low serum phosphorus#, due to decreased intestinal absorption and increased PTH-mediated renal excretion. $PTH may initially maintain normal serum calcium levels by reducing urinary calcium excretion.  However, hypocalcemia may eventually develop as bone stores are depleted in later or more severe cases. $#(Choice A)#  Primary hyperparathyroidism presents with elevated PTH, mild hypercalcemia, and low serum phosphorus (due to increased renal excretion) but is usually due to a parathyroid adenoma and is not associated with celiac disease. $#(Choice C)#  In hypoparathyroidism, low serum PTH is accompanied by hypocalcemia and an increase in serum phosphorus.  Hypoparathyroidism can be caused by severe hypomagnesemia, which can be seen with prolonged diarrhea, but this patient's magnesium level is normal. $#(Choices D and E)#  Chronic kidney disease causes hyperphosphatemia due to decreased filtration and excretion of phosphate.  Concurrently, there is decreased renal production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (the activated form) due to inadequate renal metabolic activity and suppression of 1-alpha-hydroxylase by hyperphosphatemia.  Hypocalcemia may be present, although increased PTH sometimes maintains calcium within laboratory norms.  Pseudohypoparathyroidism is characterized by resistance to PTH and presents with similar biochemical markers. $#Educational objective# Malabsorption caused by celiac disease can lead to vitamin D deficiency.

This disorder can be due to CNS disorders or psychotropic medications and is also associated with hyponatremia (ie, hypotonic hyponatremia).  However, ADH levels are low, rather than increased, and patients often have polyuria.  This patient has no history of excessive water intake or polyuria. $#Educational objective# Ectopic production of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) from malignancy can lead to the syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion, a condition of impaired urinary water excretion.

Complete insulin deficiency leads to excessive generation of organic anions (eg, ketone bodies that smell fruity), thereby causing #metabolic acidosis# (ie, decreased serum bicarbonate [HCO3−] and pH). $The kidneys can normally compensate somewhat for metabolic acidosis by increasing renal acid excretion.  The major mechanisms of increased renal acid excretion include: $• #Increased H+ secretion#:  Intracellular acidosis leads to a direct increase in H+ secretion via increased activity of the apical Na+/H+ exchanger. $• #Increased HCO3− reabsorption#:  Carbonic anhydrase in the proximal tubular lumen facilitates reabsorption of filtered HCO3−.  Each reabsorbed HCO3− is equivalent to the secretion of one H+.  In metabolic acidosis, HCO3- is completely reabsorbed from the tubular fluid. $• Increased acid buffer excretion:  Urinary acid buffers, hydrogen phosphate (HPO42−) and ammonia (NH3), are used to trap H+ in the lumen in the form of #H2PO4-# and #NH4+#, vastly increasing the amount of acid that can be #excreted# in the urine.  With chronic acidosis, proximal tubular cells greatly increase NH3 production to increase acid excretion capacity. $#Educational objective# The kidneys can normally compensate somewhat for metabolic acidosis by completely reabsorbing filtered bicarbonate (HCO3-) and excreting excess H+ in the urine.

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) normally equals approximately 125 ml/min, although this number can vary between 90 to 130 by gender and between different subjects.  The GFR depends on the difference in hydrostatic and oncotic pressures between the glomerular capillaries and Bowman's capsule.$",
  "explanation_2": "$Constriction of the efferent arteriole produces a significant increase in glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure because of the reduction in glomerular blood outflow.  This produces a corresponding increase in GFR.  Efferent arteriolar constriction also reduces renal plasma flow (RPF).  The increase in GFR along with the decrease in RPF leads to an increased filtration fraction (FF) because FF=GFR/RPF (choice D). $As RPF decreases, the slower capillary flow allows more time for the filtration of plasma across the glomerular membrane.  This leads to an increased concentration of non-filterable plasma proteins within the glomerular capillaries, thus elevating capillary oncotic pressure.  As efferent arteriolar constriction increases past a certain point, this increase in capillary oncotic pressure begins to oppose, and eventually overwhelm, the increase in capillary hydrostatic pressure also produced by efferent arteriolar constriction.  Thus, when RPF is low secondary to severe efferent arteriolar constriction, the substantially increased capillary oncotic pressure results in an overall decrease in GFR #(choice A).# $#(Choice B)#  Selective constriction of the afferent arteriole decreases plasma flow into the glomerular capillaries, reducing capillary hydrostatic pressure and thus decreasing the GFR.  Constriction of the afferent arteriole results in relatively equal decreases in RPF and GFR (FF=GFR/RPF), so the filtration fraction remains unchanged. $#Educational objective# Selective vasoconstriction of the efferent arteriole (up to certain extent) increases hydrostatic pressure in the glomerular capillaries, and therefore increases the glomerular filtration rate.  As efferent arteriolar constriction continues to increase, the glomerular filtration rate begins to decrease due to a flow-mediated rise in oncotic pressure in the glomerular capillaries.

However, a bicarbonate of 13 mEq/L is much lower than the @expected secondary compensation@, which indicates a second primary acid-base disorder.  The lower-than-expected serum bicarbonate with a high @anion gap@ [139 − (98 + 13) = 28] is consistent with a concomitant #primary anion gap metabolic acidosis#.  This mixed respiratory alkalosis and anion gap metabolic acidosis is most likely the result of #salicylate poisoning#: $• Primary respiratory alkalosis is due to direct stimulation of the medullary respiratory center by excess salicylate, resulting in both an #increased respiratory rate# and #tidal volume# (ie, increased minute ventilation). $• Primary metabolic acidosis occurs mostly because salicylate uncouples oxidative phosphorylation, which results in #increased production of lactic acid# and ketoacids in peripheral tissues.  Excess salicylic acid in the serum also makes a minor contribution.  The ionized form of these compounds also increases the anion gap (unmeasured anions). $The pH is typically near or within normal range in patients with salicylate poisoning because of the opposing influences of the respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis. $#(Choice A)#  Primary metabolic acidosis and primary metabolic alkalosis can simultaneously develop in the setting of 2 disparate pathologic processes (eg, renal failure and vomiting).  The pH and bicarbonate levels can be increased, normal, or decreased, depending on the severity of the metabolic acidosis compared with the metabolic alkalosis. $#(Choice B)#  Primary metabolic acidosis with primary respiratory acidosis (eg, sepsis and hypoventilatory respiratory failure) typically leads to significant acidemia (very low pH) with low bicarbonate and high PaCO2. $#(Choice D)#  Primary metabolic alkalosis with primary respiratory acidosis (eg, vomiting and hypoventilation due to opioid overdose) is expected to show elevated bicarbonate and PaCO2; the pH can reflect alkalemia or acidemia, depending on the relative severity of the 2 disturbances. $#(Choice E)#  Primary metabolic alkalosis with primary respiratory alkalosis (eg, vomiting and hyperventilation due to anxiety) is expected to cause significant alkalemia (very high pH) with high bicarbonate and low PaCO2. $#Educational objective# Salicylate poisoning causes mixed primary respiratory alkalosis and primary anion gap metabolic acidosis.  Mixed acid-base disturbances can be recognized by inappropriate secondary compensation for one of the primary disturbances, indicating that an additional primary disturbance must be present.  ",

ADH activates G protein-coupled @V2 receptors@ on the basolateral tubular cell membrane, stimulating phosphorylation of intracellular proteins.  This causes fusion of vesicles containing aquaporin 2 to the luminal membrane, where aquaporin serves as a water channel and allows water reabsorption in the collecting duct. $@Diabetes insipidus (DI)@ is caused by either ADH deficiency (central DI) or complete/partial unresponsiveness of the kidneys to ADH (nephrogenic DI).  The end result is free water loss in the urine with production of dilute urine (low specific gravity and urine osmolality) and dehydration that causes excessive thirst.  A water deprivation test with desmopressin (DDAVP) administration can differentiate between central and nephrogenic DI.  In patients with central DI and complete nephrogenic DI, the urine osmolality is persistently low despite an increase in serum osmolality with water deprivation.

However, the correction in primary polydipsia is more rapid, and the urine osmolality returns to a level closer to normal (but still submaximal due to washout of the medullary osmotic gradient).

  "explanation_2": "$Free water excretion by the kidney depends primarily on serum vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone) levels.  This hormone acts on the nephron to regulate the osmotic pressure of body fluids by varying the water permeability of the distal portion of the nephron.  Water and electrolyte permeability varies in different regions of the nephron as follows:  $1. Glomerular capillaries are fenestrated and therefore highly permeable to water and other solutes.  The glomeruli collectively filter about 180 L of isotonic fluid (equal to plasma osmolarity) into Bowman's space daily. $2. The proximal convoluted tubule actively reabsorbs electrolytes, glucose, and amino acids.  Water reabsorption in the proximal tubule occurs passively along with transport of solutes into the epithelial cells; thus, tubular fluid remains isotonic.  $3. The loop of Henle is located in the renal medulla, where the interstitium is hypertonic (higher osmolarity than that of plasma).  The descending limb of the loop of Henle is permeable to water, but most of the ions are retained in the lumen #(choice C).#  As water moves into the interstitium, the fluid left in the lumen becomes hypertonic.  $4. The thick and thin ascending limbs of the loop of Henle are impermeable to water.  In the ascending limb, the osmolarity of the tubular fluid decreases due to passive adsorption of NaCl in the thin region as well as active transport of electrolytes out of the lumen by the Na+/K+/2Cl- cotransporter in the thick portion.  $5. Water permeability of the early distal convoluted tubule is also very low, and more electrolytes than water are reabsorbed.  However, water permeability in the late distal tubule can vary based on vasopressin levels #(choice E).#  Urinary pH is regulated chiefly through H+ secretion by intercalated cells in the late distal and collecting tubules.  $6. The water permeability of the cortical and medullary collecting ducts is also regulated by vasopressin #(choice F).#  If the water intake of the individual is high, vasopressin is not released and water permeability of the collecting duct system is low, producing dilute urine.  In contrast, water deprivation stimulates vasopressin secretion, leading to marked reabsorption of water in the collecting ducts and the production of low-volume, high-osmolar urine. $#Educational objective# The ascending limb of the loop of Henle is impermeable to water regardless of serum vasopressin levels.  Reabsorption of electrolytes by the Na+/K+/2Cl- cotransporter occurs in the thick ascending limb and contributes to formation of the corticomedullary concentration gradient.  "

Evaluate the #pH#:  This patient's low pH of 7.25 indicates #acidemia# (ie, <7.35).  $2. Identify the #primary process#: Analyze the metabolic component of acid-base balance, serum HCO3− (normal: 24 mEq/L), and the respiratory component, PaCO2 (normal: 40 mm Hg).

In addition, patients with advanced CKD typically have decreased renal conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (the more active form) because of inadequate function of renal tissue.  The resulting #hypocalcemia#, along with hyperphosphatemia, stimulates the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and leads to #secondary hyperparathyroidism#. $#(Choice B)#  Primary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia (due to increased renal excretion of phosphorus), and increased renal production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.  In secondary hyperparathyroidism due to CKD, PTH is high but serum phosphate is elevated and hypercalcemia would not be seen. $#(Choice C)#  Hypoparathyroidism is characterized by hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and decreased renal production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.  Hypoparathyroidism is usually caused by autoimmune disease or iatrogenic injury to the parathyroid glands during neck surgery. $#(Choice D)#  Vitamin D deficiency (ie, low 25-hydroxyvitamin D) causes decreased absorption of dietary calcium and leads to hypocalcemia.  The resulting increase in PTH (secondary hyperparathyroidism) causes decreased renal reabsorption of phosphate, leading to hypophosphatemia.  1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D levels are typically low, although the increased renal conversion due to PTH may restore levels to within laboratory norms. $#(Choice E)#  Elevated 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels can be seen in granulomatous diseases (eg, sarcoidosis) and in excess intake of calcitriol supplements, and lead to increased intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate (with hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia) and suppression of PTH. $#Educational objective# Chronic kidney disease can cause hyperphosphatemia due to impaired renal excretion of phosphorus.  Elevated blood phosphate triggers the release of fibroblast growth factor 23, which lowers calcitriol production and intestinal calcium absorption.  The resulting hypocalcemia, along with hyperphosphatemia, leads to secondary hyperparathyroidism.  "

In response to low perfusion pressures, the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney synthesize renin, which converts angiotensinogen (synthesized in the liver) to angiotensin I.  Angiotensin-converting enzyme, which is synthesized largely in the lungs, then converts angiotensin I to its active form, angiotensin II. $#Angiotensin II# has multiple actions to increase systemic blood pressure.  It directly #increases systemic vascular# resistance through generalized arteriolar vasoconstriction #(choice B).#  It also increases sodium and water reabsorption both directly, by increasing sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule, and indirectly, by stimulating #aldosterone# synthesis in the adrenal cortex and antidiuretic hormone in the hypothalamus #(choice A).#  Elevated systemic pressure and blood volume help overcome the decreased perfusion pressures in the stenotic kidney and maintain a near-normal filtration rate. $However, the #unaffected kidney# is exposed to elevated systemic pressures, resulting in #increased sodium excretion# due to a pressure natriuresis effect.  Although this helps reduce circulating volume, many patients with renal artery stenosis have #chronic hypertension# due to persistent hyperreninemia and angiotensin II–induced vasoconstriction caused by the stenotic kidney. $#(Choice C)#  After placement of the clip, glomerular filtration rate will drop in the stenotic kidney, triggering compensatory RAAS activation.  This increases the perfusion pressure of the stenotic kidney, helping to normalize glomerular filtration rate.  However, like most compensatory responses, the increase in filtration caused by RAAS activation is not enough to overcome the initial drop in filtration caused by clip placement.  Therefore, the filtration rate remains less than normal in the stenotic kidney. $#(Choice D)#  Renin production is suppressed in the unaffected kidney due to its exposure to elevated systemic pressures. $#Educational objective# Unilateral renal artery stenosis causes hypoperfusion and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.  Angiotensin II causes arteriolar vasoconstriction and increases aldosterone and antidiuretic hormone synthesis.

Stimulation of the V1 receptor causes vasoconstriction and increased prostaglandin release; stimulation of the V2 receptor results in an antidiuretic response.  ADH is secreted in response to plasma hyperosmolality and, to a lesser extent, depletion of the effective circulating volume.  Water deprivation initially increases plasma osmolality, resulting in increased ADH secretion.  This causes the kidney to produce concentrated urine, which helps to counteract the rise in plasma osmolality by reducing urinary free water excretion. $The medullary portion of the collecting duct is of particular importance in the production of maximally concentrated urine as the medullary interstitium is the region of highest @osmolarity@ in the kidney.  In the setting of high serum ADH levels, a large osmotic gradient drives the absorption of free water into the hypertonic medullary interstitium.  As water leaves the tubular fluid, urea concentration greatly increases.  ADH also increases the number of passive urea transporters in the inner medullary collecting duct, allowing a substantial fraction of the highly concentrated urea to diffuse down its concentration gradient into the medullary interstitium.  When ADH levels are high, this urea resorption contributes up to 50% of total osmolarity of the medulla, further increasing the water-absorbing capacity of the nephron. $#(Choice A)#  ADH also increases water absorption in the cortical segment of the collecting duct, reducing the amount of free water delivered to the medullary collecting duct.  This prevents excess water from being absorbed into the medullary interstitium, which would otherwise dilute the osmotic gradient and reduce the maximum achievable urine concentration. $#(Choice B)#  The early distal tubule is impermeable to both water and urea. $#(Choice D)#  The proximal tubule is permeable to urea and resorbs about half of the filtered load.  However, it does not respond to ADH. $#(Choice E)#  The thin ascending limb of the loop of Henle is permeable to urea, which passively diffuses down its concentration gradient into the tubular lumen.  Secretion of urea into the thin part of the loop of Henle allows urea to recirculate and concentrate in the tubular system, further increasing its contribution to the medullary osmotic gradient. $#Educational objective# Antidiuretic hormone acts on the medullary segment of the collecting duct to increase urea and water reabsorption, allowing for the production of maximally concentrated urine.

This will decrease RPF, but will increase glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure as the fluid \"backs up\" in the glomerulus, increasing hydrostatic pressure.  This increased glomerular hydrostatic pressure will cause an increase in the filtration fraction. $The renal plasma flow (RPF) is the volume of plasma that is delivered to the kidney per unit time.  The RPF is provided by the renal blood flow, which delivers both erythrocytes and plasma to the kidney.  The RPF is theoretically calculated by subtracting the amount of erythrocytes (hematocrit) from the total renal blood flow.  Clinically, however, RPF is generally estimated by calculating the paraaminohippuric acid (PAH) clearance.  RPF is linked to the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and the filtration fraction (FF) by the following equation: $\u2003\u2003 FF = GFR / RPF $The filtration fraction refers to the proportion of the RPF that is filtered from the glomerular capillaries into Bowman's space and is expressed as a percentage.  Using the equation above, one can observe that increases in GFR or decreases in RPF will increase the FF.  The GFR is dependent on hydrostatic and oncotic pressures in the glomerular capillaries and Bowman’s space and can be calculated with the following equation: $\u2003\u2003 \\( {\\small GFR = K_f \\Big( (P_G - P_B) - (\\pi_G - \\pi_B) \\Big)} \\) $ Where Kf refers to the coefficient of filtration, PG refers to the hydrostatic pressure in the glomerular capillaries, PB refers to the hydrostatic pressure in Bowman's space, πG refers to the oncotic pressure in the glomerular capillaries and πB refers to the oncotic pressure in Bowman's space.

  "explanation_2": "$Patients with #chronic kidney disease# (CKD) often develop symptomatic anemia (eg, fatigue, exertional dyspnea) as the glomerular filtration rate declines.  Most cases are due to the #inadequate secretion of erythropoietin# (EPO), a glycoprotein hormone produced by #peritubular fibroblasts in the renal cortex# in response to tissue hypoxia (as is seen with anemia).  EPO acts on erythrocyte precursor cells (erythroid colony–forming unit cells) in the bone marrow to stimulate red blood cell differentiation and survival. $Healthy patients increase EPO levels up to 10,000-fold in response to anemia, but patients with CKD have chronic inflammatory damage to renal EPO-producing cells and are often unable to generate sufficient EPO to maintain red blood cell counts.  These individuals are often treated with #synthetic EPO agents# (eg, epoetin, darbepoetin) to stimulate erythrocyte production.  As iron is rapidly consumed to make red blood cells, individuals treated with EPO agents are often also given iron supplementation to prevent the development of iron deficiency anemia. $In adults, approximately 80% of EPO is generated in the kidney; the remainder is largely generated in the liver by hepatocytes and Ito perisinusoidal cells. $#(Choices A and C)#  Decreased renal perfusion and glomerular filtration leads to decreased solute delivery to the @juxtaglomerular apparatus@ in the distal tubule, which stimulates renin secretion by juxtaglomerular cells.  Activation of the @renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system@ leads to increased production of angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor that preferentially constricts the efferent arteriole to restore glomerular filtration.  These hormones do not have a substantial effect on red cell production. $#(Choices B and E)#  Foot processes of renal podocytes surround glomerular capillaries to prevent filtration of large molecules (eg, plasma proteins); defects can cause chronic proteinuric kidney disease (eg, minimal change disease).  Epithelial cells of the proximal tubule have a prominent role in reabsorption and secretion of solutes into the urine; these cells have high metabolic activity and are therefore susceptible to ischemic injury (eg, acute tubular necrosis) due to inadequate renal perfusion and oxygen delivery.  However, neither of these cell types produces EPO. $#Educational objective# Erythropoietin (EPO) is produced primarily by peritubular fibroblast cells in the renal cortex in response to decreased renal oxygen delivery (eg, decreased blood hemoglobin content).  EPO acts on erythrocyte precursor cells in the bone marrow to stimulate red blood cell production.

  "explanation_2": "$Serum creatinine is the most common indicator of kidney function in clinical use.  Steady-state creatinine levels are a result of the balance between creatinine synthesis in the muscle and excretion via glomerular filtration and proximal tubule secretion.  For the most part, creatinine synthesis and tubular secretion remain relatively constant.  As a result, serum creatinine levels depend primarily on the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). $The relationship between serum creatinine and GFR is nonlinear.  A person's serum creatinine can be essentially normal even after a 50% loss of kidney function (ie, following kidney donation or unilateral nephrectomy).  Serum creatinine levels begin to rise significantly as the GFR declines to <60 mL/min (assuming no change in muscle mass).  As the GFR continues to decline, the slope of the creatinine-GFR curve steepens.  Consequently, when the GFR is significantly decreased, small decrements in GFR produce relatively large changes in serum creatinine.  However, when the GFR is normal, relatively large decreases in GFR result in only small increases in serum creatinine.  Serum creatinine is therefore an insensitive indicator for decreasing GFR when creatinine levels are normal. $#Educational objective# When the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is normal, relatively large decreases in GFR result in only small increases in serum creatinine.  Conversely, when the GFR is significantly decreased, small decrements in GFR produce relatively large changes in serum creatinine.  A good rule of thumb is that every time GFR halves, serum creatinine doubles.  "

The abrupt loss of resorptive stimulus can lead to rapid bone formation, resulting in hypophosphatemia and hypocalcemia.  However, this patient has not yet undergone parathyroidectomy. $#(Choice C)#  Phosphate binders (eg, sevelamer) are synthetic polymers that bind intestinal phosphate and are subsequently eliminated in the feces.  They are used to lower plasma phosphorus in patients with hyperphosphatemia due to chronic kidney disease.  In patients not taking these medications, most phosphorus is eliminated in the urine and very little in the feces. $#(Choice D)#  Phosphate is filtered at the glomerulus and reabsorbed in the absence of PTH.  Hyperparathyroidism results in decreased reabsorption in the proximal tubule; however, phosphate is not secreted. $#(Choice E)#  Reintroduction of carbohydrates in chronically malnourished patients (eg, anorexia nervosa) leads to a surge in insulin, which drives phosphorus intracellularly for use in cellular metabolism (ie, ATP production).  This causes refeeding syndrome, characterized by severe hypophosphatemia, weakness, rhabdomyolysis, and arrhythmias.  This patient's mild hypercalcemia and constipation are more suggestive of hyperparathyroidism. $#Educational objective# Primary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by oversecretion of parathyroid hormone despite normal (or elevated) serum calcium levels.

  "explanation_2": "$This investigational drug causes a dose-dependent increase in serum calcium and urine phosphate excretion, which resembles the activity of #parathyroid hormone# (PTH). $PTH receptors are located on osteoblasts (not osteoclasts), and activation causes osteoblasts to increase production of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANK-L) and monocyte colony-stimulating factor.  These factors stimulate osteoclastic precursors to differentiate into bone-resorbing osteoclasts.  PTH also decreases the release of osteoprotegerin (OPG), a decoy receptor for RANK-L; therefore, lower levels of OPG allow for more interaction between RANK-L and the osteoclastic receptor, #increasing bone resorption# and #releasing calcium and phosphate# into circulation.  In the kidney, PTH #decreases tubular reabsorption of phosphorus# while increasing reabsorption of calcium.  Therefore, the combined effects are #increased serum calcium# and #urine phosphate levels#. $Chronically high levels of PTH (ie, hyperparathyroidism) increase the risk of osteoporosis.  However, intermittent administration of recombinant PTH analogs induces a greater increase in osteoblast activity in proportion to osteoclast activity and a net increase in new bone formation.  Teriparatide is a recombinant PTH analog used to treat osteoporosis. $#(Choice A)#  PTH increases renal conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, which increases intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate and decreases PTH secretion via negative feedback.  1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D analogs (eg, calcipotriol) can raise serum calcium to some extent, but suppression of PTH limits the degree of phosphate excretion in the urine. $#(Choice B)#  PTH increases renal phosphate excretion by inducing internalization and destruction of type IIa sodium/phosphate cotransporters (NPT2) in the proximal renal tubule.  Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is a hormone produced by osteocytes that acts synergistically with PTH to increase phosphate excretion by downregulating NPT2 gene expression.  Investigational FGF23 inhibitors reduce renal phosphate excretion. $#(Choices C and D)#  Bisphosphonates (eg, alendronate, risedronate) are pyrophosphate analogs that attach to hydroxyapatite binding sites on bone surfaces and inhibit osteoclast-mediated bone resorption.  Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody that decreases bone resorption by binding to RANK-L and blocking the interaction between RANK-L and RANK on osteoclast surfaces.  These agents generally lower, rather than raise, serum calcium levels. $#Educational objective# Parathyroid hormone (PTH) causes increased bone resorption, increased serum calcium levels, and increased renal phosphate excretion.

As a result, the urinary excretion of these substances is dependent on the glomerular filtration rate and remains equal to the filtered load of the substance regardless of the serum concentration (note that urinary excretion of creatinine is slightly more than the filtered rate due to tubular secretion). $#(Choice E)#  Urea is filtered and then reabsorbed by passive diffusion into the peritubular capillaries.  Approximately 20%-50% of the filtered load is normally reabsorbed.  Urea has no Tmax because it is passively reabsorbed. $#Educational objective# At normal plasma concentrations of glucose, the renal tubules reabsorb the entire filtered load of glucose because it is below the maximum tubular reabsorption ability (transport maximum of glucose).  At higher plasma concentrations, glucose is excreted when the filtered amount exceeds the transport maximum.  The serum concentration at which glucosuria begins, called the threshold of glucose, is approximately 200 mg/dL.  "

  "explanation_2": "$Polyuria that resolves with the administration of desmopressin (DDAVP, synthetic analogue of vasopressin) is likely secondary to deficient vasopressin secretion (central diabetes insipidus).  #Vasopressin# produces a V2 receptor-mediated increase in water permeability within the cortical and medullary collecting ducts.  As water leaves the tubular fluid, urea concentration greatly increases in these tubular segments.  Although the cortical collecting duct is impermeable to urea, vasopressin activates urea transporters in the #medullary collecting duct#, increasing urea reabsorption and #decreasing renal urea clearance#.  This passive reabsorption of urea into the medullary interstitium in the presence of ADH significantly increases the medullary osmotic gradient, allowing the production of maximally concentrated urine. $#(Choice A)#  The majority of filtered calcium is passively absorbed in the proximal tubule and ascending limb of Henle's loop.  Further calcium reabsorption by the distal and collecting ducts is stimulated by parathyroid hormone (not vasopressin). $#(Choice B)#  Creatinine is freely filtered by the glomerulus, and a small amount is also secreted by the proximal tubule.  No further secretion or reabsorption occurs beyond the proximal tubule. $#(Choice C)#  Glucose is filtered in the glomerulus and fully reabsorbed in the proximal tubule as long as the filtered glucose is lower than the transport maximum (Tm).  Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) receptor inhibitors act on the tubular receptors to lower the Tm of glucose and may be used as third-line agents in type 2 diabetes mellitus. $#(Choice D)#  Para-amino hippuric (PAH) acid is filtered in the glomerulus and nearly completely secreted by the proximal tubules without significant tubular reabsorption.  PAH clearance depends on renal plasma flow.  Unlike vasopressin, desmopressin selectively activates V2 receptors and does not cause vasoconstriction (mediated by V1 receptors). $#Educational objective# Vasopressin and desmopressin cause a V2 receptor-mediated increase in water and urea permeability at the inner medullary collecting duct.  The resulting rise in urea reabsorption (decreased urea clearance) enhances the medullary osmotic gradient, allowing the production of maximally concentrated urine.  "

Therefore, factors that reduce renal drug excretion and lead to increased plasma drug levels include the following: $• #Reduced glomerular filtration:#  Kidney disease (eg, chronic kidney disease from diabetes mellitus) and reduced renal blood flow (eg, NSAID-induced vasoconstriction, volume contraction) lead to reduced drug filtration.  In addition, plasma proteins are not filtered at the glomerulus; therefore, highly protein-bound drugs are not effectively filtered. $• #Reduced renal tubular secretion:#  Active transport of drugs is largely dependent on transporters (eg, organic anion or cation transporter).  Coadministration of drugs with overlapping substrate specificity can result in competition for or inhibition of transporters. $• #Increased renal tubular reabsorption:#  Only polarized (ionized) drugs are water soluble, whereas nonionized forms are lipid soluble and can passively diffuse across the renal tubular membrane to reenter the plasma.  Therefore, alterations in urine pH can augment drug excretion; for example, acidification of urine favors the reabsorption of acidic drugs because a greater proportion of the drug is in the nonionized form. $The urinary excretion rate of drug X was reduced from 75 to 50 mg/min after the administration of drug Y.  Of the options available, only #decreasing the renal tubular secretion# of drug X reduces its excretion rate.  Drug Y likely had similar specificity for active transporters in the renal tubules, limiting or inhibiting the secretion of drug X. $#(Choices A, C, and D)#  Decreased renal tubular reabsorption, displacement from plasma proteins, and increased glomerular filtration would all increase the excretion rate of drug X. $#Educational objective# Renal excretion of a drug is dependent on: $• Glomerular filtration (reduced with low renal blood flow, kidney disease, and high drug protein binding) $• Renal tubular secretion (reduced by coadministration of drugs with overlapping substrate specificity) $• Tubular reabsorption (may be altered by changes in urine pH)  "

Dermal abnormalities (eg, alopecia) also are common due to keratinocyte dysfunction.  The most common cause of rickets is vitamin D deficiency, but less common causes include #hereditary vitamin D–resistant #rickets (HVDRR), which is caused by inactivating #mutations #of the vitamin D receptor. $Most vitamin D is stored in the form of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, which has only weak activity.  In response to parathyroid hormone (PTH), it is converted to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, the primary active form, by @1-alpha-hydroxylase@ in the kidneys.  The action of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is mediated by the vitamin D receptor; prominent effects include increases in intestinal calcium absorption, renal calcium and phosphate reabsorption, and bone mineralization. $In patients with HVDRR, as in those with severe nutritional vitamin D deficiency, #lack of vitamin D effect# leads to #hypocalcemia# (decreased intestinal absorption); the compensatory rise in PTH causes increased bone resorption and renal calcium reabsorption to partially correct the circulating calcium deficit but causes #renal phosphorus wasting# as well.  The high levels of PTH also induce greater 1-alpha-hydroxylase activity, leading to #elevated 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D# levels. $#(Choice A)#  Catabolism of vitamin D is initiated by CYP24A1 (ie, 24-hydroxylase), which inactivates both the 25- and 1,25-hydroxylated vitamin D forms.  Expression of this enzyme is induced by carbamazepine and other anticonvulsants (eg, phenytoin), increasing the risk of vitamin D deficiency. $#(Choice B)#  Patients with vitamin D–deficiency rickets, the more common type, have clinical features resembling HVDRR, including hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia.  However, 25-hydroxyvitamin D is low, reflecting reduced whole-body stores (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D may sometimes be normal due to upregulation of PTH). $#(Choice D)#  Primary hyperparathyroidism presents with mild or moderate hypercalcemia.  Serum phosphorus is low due to renal phosphate wasting, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is elevated due to increased activity of 1-alpha-hydroxylase.  25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are generally unaffected. $#(Choice E)#  Granulomatous diseases (eg, sarcoidosis, tuberculosis) can be associated with extrarenal expression of 1-alpha-hydroxylase by macrophages.  This leads to increased production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, hypercalcemia, and hyperphosphatemia.  Total vitamin D stores (25-hydroxyvitamin D) are generally normal. $#Educational objective# Lack of vitamin D effect (eg, vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D receptor mutation) causes hypocalcemia due to inadequate calcium absorption.  The compensatory rise in parathyroid hormone (PTH) causes increased bone resorption, renal calcium reabsorption, and renal phosphorus wasting.

  "explanation_2": "$This mother has oligohydramnios, and the fetus has bilaterally enlarged cystic kidneys.  Because amniotic fluid is largely composed of fetal urine, these findings are concerning for fetal kidney dysfunction and reduced urine production.  In this case, the fetus likely has #autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease# (ARPKD), a condition caused by a mutation in fibrocystin (protein found in epithelial cells of renal tubules).  Fibrocystin deficiency leads to diffuse microcysts, as seen here, and impaired kidney function. $Any condition that causes #anuria or oliguria in utero# (eg, ARPKD, bilateral renal agenesis) results in #severe oligohydramnios# and risk of Potter sequence.  #Potter sequence# is a predictable series of anomalies caused by fetal compression from insufficient amniotic fluid.  Findings include the following: $• #Flattened facies:#  Extrinsic fetal compression leads to a flattened, depressed nasal bridge; prominent epicanthal folds; low-set ears; and a recessed chin. $• #Limb deformities:#  Restricted fetal movement causes deformities such as contractures, hip dislocation, and clubfoot. $• #Pulmonary hypoplasia:#  Restricted thoracic expansion limits fetal lung development, causing respiratory distress and decreased breath sounds after birth.  Amniotic fluid is also thought to promote production of elastin, collagen, and vascular endothelial growth factor in fetal lungs, and oligohydramnios likely results in reduced alveolarization and angiogenesis. $Potter sequence is often fatal in infancy, and patients who survive typically develop chronic lung and kidney disease. $#(Choice A)#  Bladder outlet obstruction (eg, posterior urethral valves) causes bladder distension, bilateral hydronephrosis, and in severe cases impaired kidney function and oligohydramnios.  However, in contrast to this case, renal cysts would not be present. $#(Choice B)#  Cerebral aneurysms are a common complication of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.  However, most patients remain asymptomatic until adulthood; ARPKD is much more likely in this neonate with severe renal impairment. $#(Choice C)#  Segmental facial hemangiomas may be associated with other anomalies, as in the PHACE syndrome (abnormalities of the #P#osterior fossa; #H#emangiomas; and #A#rterial cerebrovascular, #C#ardiac, and #E#ye anomalies).  Vascular tumors are not associated with ARPKD or Potter sequence. $#(Choice D)#  Intestinal atresia is associated with excessive, not reduced, amniotic fluid (polyhydramnios) due to impaired fluid absorption by the fetal gastrointestinal tract.  Furthermore, this patient's renal findings would not be expected in a patient with intestinal atresia. $#Educational objective# Amniotic fluid is largely composed of fetal urine, and oligohydramnios (low fluid) is often associated with kidney dysfunction in the fetus (eg, diffuse cysts seen in autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease).  Extrinsic fetal compression from a low amniotic fluid level leads to Potter sequence with characteristic findings of flattened facies, limb deformities, and pulmonary hypoplasia.  "

  "explanation_2": "$#Fetal hydronephrosis# is a common finding on routine ultrasound examination during the second trimester.  The finding is most commonly #unilateral#, mild, and transient, likely related to a temporary narrowing in the #ureteropelvic junction# (UPJ) during normal development, as the fetal renal pelvis is highly compliant and susceptible to dilation.  In this case, however, the dilation is severe, making a pathologic cause more likely. $The most common pathologic cause of antenatal hydronephrosis is persistent UPJ #obstruction# due to an embryologic defect that develops as follows: $• The fetal @genitourinary tract@ is derived from the metanephric blastema and the ureteric bud (a dorsal outgrowth of the mesonephric duct).  The metanephric blastema develops into functional renal parenchyma by 10 weeks gestation while the ureteric bud develops into the renal pelvis and ureters through sequential dilation and canalization.  The UPJ is the last segment of the fetal ureter to canalize. $• The pathogenesis of fetal UPJ obstruction likely involves #canalization failure# resulting in stenosis of the proximal ureter.  Most cases are unilateral and cause hydronephrosis with calyceal/renal pelvic dilation and without ureteral dilation.  If the condition is not diagnosed prenatally, it may present with a palpable abdominal mass (enlarged kidney) on examination. $#(Choice A)#  Neurogenic causes of obstructive uropathy (eg, spinal cord damage) result in bilateral hydronephrosis along with hydroureter due to dysfunctional voiding. $#(Choices C and D)#  Obstruction of the urethra or urinary meatus causes bilateral, not unilateral, hydronephrosis in addition to ureteral dilation.  The most common cause in boys is @posterior urethral valves@ or obstructive urogenital membranes at the junction of the bladder and urethra.  Other congenital anomalies at this anatomic level that would also cause bilateral fetal hydronephrosis include urethral strictures, meatal stenosis, and bladder neck obstruction. $#(Choice E)#  Abnormalities at the vesicoureteral junction (eg, congenital anomaly, renal calculi) can cause obstruction but are rare and would lead to ureteral dilation (not seen here) if severe enough to cause hydronephrosis.  Similarly, @vesicoureteral reflux (VUR)@, a common cause of fetal hydronephrosis, is also associated with ureteral dilation/tortuosity. $#Educational objective# Inadequate canalization of the ureter at the ureteropelvic junction (the connection site between the kidney and the ureter) is the most common cause of severe, unilateral fetal hydronephrosis.

However, because it connects the yolk sac to the fetal midgut, failed obliteration results in a connection between @umbilicus and bowel@ (not bladder). $#(Choices B and C)#  The umbilical arteries and vein are contained within the umbilical cord, and abnormalities (eg, single umbilical artery) are usually isolated.  These vascular structures are not connected to the bladder lumen. $#(Choice E)#  The ureters are derived from the @mesonephric duct@, and abnormalities may result in ectopic ureteral insertion along the mesonephric system (eg, urethra).  A midline bladder diverticulum directed toward the umbilicus would not be expected. $#(Choice F)#  The urorectal septum divides the cloaca into the distal anorectal and urogenital regions.  Developmental abnormalities would not explain this patient's abnormal urinary flow from the bladder to the umbilicus. $#Educational objective# Congenital anomalies of the urachus result in an abnormal connection between the bladder and the umbilicus.  Full patency results in urinary umbilical leakage, whereas partial patency can result in a range of defects, including a bladder diverticulum (increases the risk of urinary tract infection due to stasis of urine).

The timeline (3 weeks after a skin infection) of symptoms suggests the most likely cause is #poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis# (PSGN), an immune complex–mediated disease that occurs after exposure to nephritogenic strains of group A Streptococcus.  Laboratory evaluation reveals classic signs of nephritic syndrome (eg, hematuria, red blood cell [RBC] casts, mild proteinuria). $The #immune complexes# in PSGN are deposited along the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) and are visible on electron microscopy as large, dome-shaped, #subepithelial#, electron-dense #deposits# (@\"humps\"@).  These can also be visualized on immunofluorescence as #granular# deposits of IgG, IgM, and C3 along the GBM and glomerular mesangium (\"#lumpy-bumpy#\" appearance).  Because the immune complexes trigger an inflammatory reaction, light microscopy shows large glomeruli that are hypercellular due to leukocyte infiltration and proliferation of glomerular cells (a response to injury). $#(Choice A)#  Proteins such as albumin may be lost in the urine due to increased permeability of the glomerular capillary wall in PSGN.  However, albumin does not deposit within the glomerulus or renal tubules. $#(Choice B)#  Many antibiotics (eg, penicillins, cephalosporins) can cause acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), which often manifests as peritubular T-lymphocyte, macrophage, and eosinophilic infiltration.  However, edema, significant hematuria, and proteinuria are uncommon, and AIN usually resolves when the offending agent is discontinued. $#(Choice C)#  Prominent fibrin deposition is characteristic of rapidly progressive (crescentic) glomerulonephritis. $#(Choice D)#  Hyaline (acellular, homogeneous, proteinaceous material) can accumulate within the glomerular capillary and arteriolar walls in diabetic nephropathy due to extravasation of plasma proteins. $#(Choice F)#  Lipid droplets in renal tubules may be seen in conditions causing nephrotic syndrome, which leads to heavy proteinuria and edema; however, gross hematuria and RBC casts are unexpected.  In addition, lipid droplets do not deposit on the basement membrane. $#(Choice G)#  Neutrophils and monocytes infiltrate the glomeruli in PSGN, contributing to the hypercellular appearance on light microscopy.  Enzymes released from these cells would not typically form extracellular aggregates. $#Educational objective# Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is an immune complex–mediated disease that occurs 2-4 weeks after group A Streptococcus skin infections.
