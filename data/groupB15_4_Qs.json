It may be the result of a recording error, a measurement error, or a natural phenomenon.  In this case, the value of 26 mm Hg is an outlier as all the other values lie between 10 and 12 mm Hg.  An outlier can affect measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) as well as measures of dispersion (standard deviation, variance). $This patient had 20 initial measurements that were all between 10 and 12 mm Hg.  Although it is not required to answer this question correctly, a numerical example can help to explain the effect of an outlier such as 26 mm Hg.  Assume that the patient's 20 initial measurements were: 9 measurements of 10 mm Hg, 6 measurements of 11 mm Hg, and 5 measurements of 12 mm Hg.  The #mode# is the most frequently observed data point, so the mode for this initial dataset is 10 mm Hg (because this value is observed 9 times whereas the other 2 values are observed 6 times and 5 times).  If the next measurement is 26 mm Hg, the mode would remain 10 mm Hg because this would still be the most commonly observed value.  Therefore, the mode would remain unchanged.  The mode tends to be resistant to outliers because outliers are not likely to affect the most frequently observed value in a dataset. $#(Choice A)#  The #mean# (or average) can be quite sensitive to outliers, especially in the case of small datasets and extreme outliers.  For instance, the mean of the 20 initial measurements is 10.8 mm Hg (obtained by calculating [9 × 10 mm Hg + 6 × 11 mm Hg + 5 × 12 mm Hg] / 20).  With an additional measurement of 26 mm Hg, the mean would become 11.5 mm Hg (obtained by calculating [1 × 26 mm Hg + 9 × 10 mm Hg + 6 × 11 mm Hg + 5 × 12 mm Hg] / 21). $#(Choice C)#  The #range# is equal to the maximal value minus the minimal value and would clearly be affected by outliers.  With the 20 initial measurements, the range is 12 mm Hg – 10 mm Hg = 2 mm Hg.  If the next measurement is 26 mm Hg, then the range will be 26 mm Hg – 10 mm Hg = 16 mm Hg. $#(Choices D and E)#  The standard deviation and variance are measures of dispersion, which reflect how spread out the values in a dataset are from one another.

According to the figure, 50 children had 0 UTIs, 30 children had 1 UTI, 10 had 2 UTIs, and 10 had 3 UTIs. $In general, the average (or mean) of a dataset is the sum of the values divided by the total number of values.  In this example, the average number of UTI episodes per child is the sum (ie, total number) of UTIs divided by the total sample size (ie, total number of children).  The total sample size is: 50 + 30 + 10 + 10 = 100 children.  The total number of UTIs is: (0 × 50) + (1 × 30) + (2 × 10) + (3 × 10) = 0 + 30 + 20 + 30 = 80 UTIs.  The average is obtained by dividing the total number of UTIs (80) by the total sample size (100).  Therefore, the average number of UTI episodes per year = 80/100 = 0.8 UTIs for a child in this sample. $In conclusion, children age 2-5 years in this clinic experienced between 0 and 1 UTI over 1 year on average. $#Educational objective# The average (or mean) of a dataset of values is the sum of the values divided by the total number of values.

However, in actual research scenarios, continuous variables often have #asymmetrical distributions#.  When a distribution curve is asymmetric, it is either positively or negatively skewed: $• In a #positively skewed# distribution, there is an increased number of observations with #larger-than-expected magnitudes# (ie, extreme values) that shift the mean toward the #right#, producing a longer slope of the curve (\"tail\") on the positive side of the distribution. $• In a #negatively skewed# distribution, there is an increased number of observations with #smaller-than-expected magnitudes# that shift the mean toward the #left#, producing a longer slope of the curve (\"tail\") on the negative side of the distribution. $In general, in a #positively# skewed distribution, the mean is the most shifted in the positive direction, followed by the median and then the mode (#mode < median < mean#).
