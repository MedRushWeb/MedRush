A common cause is #uterine atony# (failure of the uterus to contract and compress the placental site vessels), as evidenced by a #boggy uterus#. Surgery is indicated when medical management (eg, uterotonic medications) cannot control uterine bleeding.\nThe main blood supply to the uterus is the uterine artery, a branch of the anterior division of the internal iliac artery. However, there are robust collaterals (eg, vaginal, ovarian) to the uterus during pregnancy such that in cases of severe PPH, ligation (tying off with suture) of the uterine arteries may fail to control the bleeding. In these cases, #bilateral ligation# of the #internal iliac artery# (also known as the hypogastric artery), the main blood supply to the pelvis, is performed to decrease flow rate and pulse pressure within all pelvic vessels, which can #stop uterine bleeding# and avoid hysterectomy.\nThe structures supplied by the internal iliac arteries are typically unharmed by the procedure due to anastomoses with branches of the external iliac artery (eg, medial femoral circumflex-obturator anastomosis) or eventual recanalization. Therefore, in women of childbearing age, fertility is preserved and complication rates (eg, buttock claudication) are low.\n$#(Choices A and B)# The aorta bifurcates into the common iliac arteries, which bifurcate into the internal and external iliac arteries. The external iliac becomes the femoral artery after exiting the pelvis and supplies the leg. Bilateral ligation of the common or external iliac would cut off blood flow to the lower extremities, leading to ischemia and necrosis of the legs.\n$(Choice D) The internal pudendal artery, also a branch of the anterior division of the internal iliac, runs through the sciatic foramina to supply the perineum. Because the internal pudendal artery is distal to the uterine artery on the internal iliac, ligation would not decrease uterine blood flow.\n$(Choice E) The ovarian artery, which originates from the abdominal aorta, supplies primarily the ovary and secondarily the uterus. Although bilateral ligation could somewhat decrease uterine blood flow, it would also cause irreversible ovarian necrosis, infertility, and menopause.\n$Educational objective\nThe internal iliac artery (hypogastric artery) supplies blood to the pelvis, including the uterus via the uterine artery. Therefore, bilateral ligation of the internal iliac artery is a potential surgical management option for postpartum hemorrhage due to uterine atony."

Fibroids in the #posterior uterus# can put pressure on the #colon#, leading to #constipation#. $Additional symptoms vary, depending on location.  Anterior subserosal fibroids may cause obstructive urinary symptoms (eg, urgency, incomplete emptying).

As a result of pooled blood behind the hymen, physical examination typically reveals a smooth @vaginal bulge@ (#hematocolpos#) and a #palpable mass anterior to the rectum# (ie, the distended vagina).  Treatment is with hymenal incision and drainage, which resolves the obstruction and amenorrhea. $#(Choice A)#  @Androgen insensitivity syndrome@ causes primary amenorrhea due to the lack of müllerian structures.  Patients are 46,XY males but appear phenotypically female (ie, no external male genitalia) due to an androgen receptor defect.  These patients have normal breast development due to peripheral aromatization of testosterone to estrogen and may have palpable prostate tissue (eg, mass anterior to the rectum).  However, unlike this patient, they usually have minimal axillary or pubic hair due to androgen resistance. $#(Choice B)#  @Asherman syndrome@, the development of intrauterine adhesions, can obstruct uterine outflow and cause abdominopelvic pain and amenorrhea (typically secondary amenorrhea).  However, patients usually have a history of uterine infection or intrauterine surgery (eg, dilation and curettage), and there is no association with a palpable mass on digital rectal examination. $#(Choice C)#  @Endometriosis@, the ectopic implantation of endometrium outside the uterus, can cause worsening, cyclic abdominopelvic pain and rectovaginal nodularity (eg, endometrial implants in the pouch of Douglas) that may be palpable on digital rectal examination.  However, endometriosis is not associated with amenorrhea. $#(Choice E)#  @Kallmann syndrome@ can present with primary amenorrhea due to the impaired synthesis of gonadotropin-releasing hormone in the hypothalamus; therefore, in contrast to this patient with normal secondary sexual characteristics, those with Kallmann syndrome typically have no secondary sexual characteristics. $#Educational objective# Adolescent girls with primary amenorrhea, normal secondary sexual characteristics, and progressively worsening abdominopelvic pain may have an imperforate hymen.  Examination typically shows a smooth vaginal bulge (hematocolpos) and a palpable mass anterior to the rectum.  ",

The most common risk factor is #vaginal delivery#, which can either directly damage the pelvic musculature or #injure the pudendal nerve# that provides motor and sensory innervation to the pelvic floor muscles and external urethral and anal sphincters. $Although some women have symptoms of prolapse immediately after delivery (typically due to complete transection of the pudendal nerve), most patients develop prolapse months to years later due to slow #degeneration# of the #pelvic floor muscles#.  Delivery-related muscle injury, in addition to age-related tissue atrophy, can also contribute to pelvic floor laxity and resultant herniation of pelvic organs through the vaginal wall. $Patients typically have #vaginal pressure#; other symptoms (eg, bladder dysfunction, constipation) may develop, depending on whether the prolapse is located at the anterior vaginal wall (ie, herniated bladder [@cystocele@]) or the posterior vaginal wall (ie, herniated rectum [@rectocele@]).  On examination, patients typically have a #vaginal bulge# exacerbated with the Valsalva maneuver (ie, increased intraabdominal pressure). $#(Choice A)#  The @uterosacral ligaments@ run along the lateral pelvic wall and support the uterus and vaginal apex by lifting and anchoring them to the sacrum.  Excessive ligament laxity contributes to uterine and vaginal prolapse; in contrast, chronic endometriosis causes fibrosis and scarring that can shorten the ligaments and fix pelvic organs in place. $#(Choice B)#  Ligation of the uterine artery decreases blood flow to the uterus to shrink uterine @fibroids@.  However, the pelvic floor muscles are supplied primarily by the internal pudendal artery (another branch of the internal iliac artery); therefore, uterine artery ligation would not compromise pelvic floor strength. $#(Choice D)#  The presence of uterine leiomyomas increase pressure on the pelvic floor and place greater strain on the pelvic floor muscles.  However, this patient has a small mobile uterus on examination, making uterine leiomyomas an unlikely cause of her pelvic organ prolapse. $#Educational objective# Pudendal nerve injury during vaginal delivery leads to gradual denervation and weakness of the pelvic floor muscles.

The levator ani muscle complex forms most of the pelvic floor and functions to hold the pelvic organs in a stable position; when this complex is damaged, such as with increased intraabdominal pressure (eg, #pregnancy#, obesity) or obstetric trauma (eg, forceps-assisted vaginal delivery), there is increased pelvic floor laxity, resulting in decreased pelvic organ support. $The decreased pelvic floor support causes an anatomic change to normal pelvic organ positions; for the rectum, this leads to a change in rectal angle during defecation, which can cause incomplete defecation and #constipation#.  With accumulation of fecal material, the rectum expands and herniates through the rectovaginal septum, causing #prolapse of the rectum# into the #posterior vaginal wall# (ie, #rectocele#).  The prolapse is exacerbated by Valsalva maneuvers (eg, #vaginal bulge while straining#), which cause further difficulty with defecation; therefore, some patients apply digital pressure against the prolapse (ie, #splinting#) to help improve bowel movements. $#(Choice A)#  @Hirschsprung disease@, the absence of colonic intramural ganglion cells due to failed neural crest cell migration, typically presents in infants.  It causes constipation and increased rectal tone due to the inability of the aganglionic segment to relax. $#(Choice B)#  Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is often associated with chronic irregular luminal contractions and increased gastrointestinal tract sensitivity.  It typically presents with recurrent abdominal pain and either diarrhea or constipation.

Symptoms related to arousal may include decreased excitement/pleasure in response to mental and physical sexual cues and encounters. $ (Choice A)  Although the patient mentions that her condition is worse since her promotion 3 months ago, there is evidence of a change in sexual functioning preceding this stressful event. $ (Choice B)  Serotonergic antidepressants (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) are a common cause of medication-induced sexual dysfunction and can cause decreased libido as well as anorgasmia in women.  This patient, however, is taking bupropion, a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor that does not affect serotonin and is unlikely to cause sexual side effects. $ (Choice C)  Female orgasmic disorder is characterized by marked delay in, decreased frequency and intensity of, or absence of orgasms. $ (Choice E)  Genitopelvic pain/penetration disorder involves recurrent difficulties with pain or fear of pain with vaginal intercourse or penetration attempts. $ (Choice F)  Although declining levels of estrogen in peri- and post-menopausal women may be associated with decreased sexual interest in some patients, this is typically accompanied by decreased vaginal lubrication, which this woman does not describe. $ Educational objective Female sexual interest/arousal disorder is characterized by lack of, or significantly reduced, sexual interest and/or arousal.  Diagnosis requires ruling out psychological, medical, and substance/medication-related causes and relationship problems."

These elements proliferate during pregnancy in preparation for lactation. $The lobes consist of #terminal duct lobular units# (TDLUs), the epithelial elements that serve as the functional units of the breast.

    "explanation_2": "This patient with an ovarian mass, hirsutism (eg, coarse facial hair), and voice deepening likely has a #Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor#, an ovarian sex cord–stromal tumor.  Ovarian tumors can be associated with increased hormonal or enzymatic activity based on their cell composition.  Sertoli and Leydig cells are normally found in the male testes but can develop in the ovaries and produce #excess testosterone#.  With proliferation of these cells, male-range testosterone levels can occur and cause signs of hyperandrogenism.  Therefore, patients typically present with: $• #Frank virilization#:  Testosterone excess can cause #hirsutism# and #clitoromegaly#, as seen in this patient.  Additional features may include male pattern (bitemporal) baldness, #voice deepening#, and increased muscle mass. $• Anovulation and amenorrhea:  Elevated testosterone levels suppress hypothalamic GnRH and pituitary FSH/LH release.  Therefore, patients may develop signs of anovulation such as abnormal uterine bleeding or #amenorrhea#. $Diagnosis is supported by markedly elevated serum testosterone levels, but surgical removal is needed for definitive histologic diagnosis. $#(Choices A and B)#  Dysgerminomas and endodermal sinus (yolk sac) tumors are both malignant ovarian germ cell tumors with hormonal activity.  Dysgerminomas secrete β-hCG and lactate dehydrogenase; yolk sac tumors secrete alpha-fetoprotein.  Because they do not secrete testosterone, neither tumor type is associated with rapid-onset virilization. $#(Choice C)#  Granulosa cell tumors are sex cord–stromal tumors that secrete estrogen and inhibin.  Patients typically have signs of excessive estrogen (eg, breast tenderness, abnormal uterine bleeding due to endometrial hyperplasia) rather than signs of excess testosterone. $#(Choice D)#  Mature cystic teratomas (dermoid cysts) are the most common benign germ cell tumor and are typically composed of several differentiated tissues (eg, hair, sebaceous glands) arising from the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm.  Most mature cystic teratomas do not produce hormones.  The exception is struma ovarii, a monodermal teratoma mostly composed of thyroid tissue that can secrete thyroid hormone and cause signs of hyperthyroidism (eg, tachycardia, weight loss). $#(Choice E)#  Serous cystadenocarcinomas are the most common epithelial ovarian cancer but typically have no hormonal or enzymatic activity. $#Educational objective# Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors of the ovary arise from the sex cord stroma and secrete testosterone.

HPV is a small double-stranded DNA virus with multiple genotypes.  High-risk subtypes 16 and 18 are the most common identified in cervical cancers. $The oncogenic capability of HPV is dependent on its ability to integrate into the host genome and subsequently produce #viral proteins E6 and E7#, which interact with cell cycle regulatory proteins #p53 and Rb#, respectively.  E6 binds p53, leading to its ubiquination and subsequent proteasomal degradation.  Without p53, the cell is unable to halt cell growth to repair damaged DNA or trigger apoptosis when DNA is damaged beyond repair.  Similarly, E7 binds Rb and displaces bound transcription factors, promoting unregulated DNA replication and cyclin-mediated cell cycling.  The collective effects of E6 and E7 lead to #inhibition of cell cycle regulation# and evasion of apoptosis, consequently increasing malignant potential. $#(Choice A)#  RAS and BRAF are proto-oncogenes that code for cytoplasmic signal transducer proteins, which upregulate cellular proliferation and differentiation when activated.  Mutations causing constitutive activation of these proteins are linked to development of pancreatic cancer (Ras) and malignant melanomas (BRAF). $#(Choice B)#  Mutations resulting in upregulation of the epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene have been implicated in the development of solid tumors (eg, colon, breast, lung). $#(Choice C)#  MSH2 is a DNA mismatch repair protein encoded by the MSH2 gene, which leads to ineffective DNA repair when inactivated.  This is the pathogenic basis of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). $#(Choice D)#  Platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) activity is essential for normal development of the central nervous system during the embryonic period.  Upregulation of PDGF synthesis and corresponding receptor activation are responsible for the malignant transformation of glial cells in glioblastoma. $#Educational objective# Human papillomavirus (HPV) oncogenicity relies on the inhibitory effects of viral proteins E6 and E7 on cell cycle regulatory proteins p53 and Rb.  This allows cells infected with HPV to undergo unchecked cellular proliferation and evasion of apoptosis, promoting genomic instability and malignant transformation. "

Risk factors include nulliparity, early menarche, and prolonged menses; in contrast, multiparity and late menarche lower the risk due to fewer menstrual cycles (ie, fewer opportunities for retrograde menstruation). $Like the uterine endometrium, ectopic endometrium undergoes periods of proliferation and breakdown concordant with the @menstrual cycle@.  Although patients typically have #regular menstrual cycles# (eg, every 26 days, lasting 5 days), shedding from ectopic endometrial glands can form intraperitoneal blood collections, leading to #dysmenorrhea#.

In contrast to this patient with endometriosis, those with endometrial hyperplasia typically have irregular, anovulatory menses. $#(Choice D)#  Multiple ovarian follicular cysts with cortical fibrosis occur in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).  Although PCOS can cause infertility due to anovulation, it is typically associated with obesity, hyperandrogenism (eg, hirsutism, acne), and oligomenorrhea.  This patient's regular menses make this etiology unlikely. $#(Choice E)#  @Adenomyosis@ is the abnormal presence and proliferation of endometrial glands within the uterine myometrium.  Although adenomyosis can cause dysmenorrhea, patients typically have heavy menses and a symmetrically enlarged uterus, which are not seen in this patient. $#Educational objective# Endometriosis is the presence of endometrial glands and stroma in an extrauterine location.  Ectopic implants within the intraperitoneal cavity degenerate during menses and can cause abdominopelvic inflammation and the formation of tissue adhesions.

Ovarian estrogen production occurs primarily by the conversion of androgens (produced by theca cells) into estrogens within granulosa cells that contain the enzyme aromatase.  Letrozole #inhibits aromatase# (ie, prevents androgen-to-estrogen conversion) and #suppresses ovarian estradiol production#.  Letrozole also inhibits aromatase in adipose tissue, decreasing another source of estrogen (eg, estrone).  In response, the pituitary releases more FSH and LH, which stimulates ovulation. $• #Clomiphene# acts on estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus and pituitary.  When estrogen levels are high (as in PCOS), there is negative estrogenic feedback on both the hypothalamus and pituitary to stop the release of GnRH, FSH, and LH.  @Clomiphene@ binds to estrogen receptors for an extended period, resulting in receptor depletion in the hypothalamus and pituitary, thereby allowing for continued FSH and LH release #(choice B).# $#(Choice A)#  Bromocriptine, a dopamine receptor agonist, decreases prolactin secretion.  Prolactin normally inhibits FSH release, so patients with hyperprolactinemia (eg, lactotroph adenoma) often have infertility.  In these patients, bromocriptine can normalize prolactin levels and restore FSH and estrogen levels. $#(Choice C)#  Increased endometrial proliferation, which increases the risk for endometrial hyperplasia or cancer, occurs with the use of unopposed estrogen (eg, estrogen-only hormone therapy) or certain selective estrogen receptor modulators (eg, tamoxifen). $#(Choice D)#  When administered continuously, leuprolide (@GnRH agonist@) downregulates pituitary GnRH receptors and decreases FSH and estrogen, causing a hypogonadotropic, hypogonadal state clinically similar to that of menopause. $#Educational objective# Polycystic ovary syndrome can present with irregular menses, enlarged ovaries, and anovulatory infertility.  Letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, acts on the ovary and peripheral adipose tissue to inhibit androgen-to-estrogen conversion by the enzyme aromatase; the subsequent decrease in estrogen production causes the pituitary to release more FSH and LH, thereby stimulating ovulation.

Ovarian tumor types include: $• Surface epithelial-stroma: composed of cells that support the normal ovarian structure for ovulation (eg, serous, mucinous epithelial cells). $• Sex cord-stroma: composed of cells that support and surround the oocyte.  These cells secrete sex hormones including estrogen (granulosa cells) and testosterone (Sertoli-Leydig cells). $• Germ cell: composed of cells that can develop into an embryo or placenta.  These tumors are composed of varying amounts of germ layers (ie, endoderm, mesoderm, ectoderm), yolk sac, or placenta (eg, chorion).  They often have associated hormonal activity (eg, increased hCG, alpha fetoprotein). $This patient's unintentional weight loss, hot flashes, irregular menses, and low TSH level are consistent with #thyrotoxicosis# (ie, abnormally high circulating thyroid hormone levels).  In the setting of an adnexal mass, this presentation is classic for #struma ovarii#, an ovarian #germ cell tumor# composed of >50% mature thyroid tissue (derived from the #endoderm#) that can secrete thyroid hormone.  On gross examination, struma ovarii typically appears as an oily (eg, sebaceous) cystic mass.  Microscopic examination reveals @thyroid follicles@ filled with colloid and surrounded by ovarian stroma. $#(Choice A)#  @Endometriomas@ occur when ectopic endometrial tissue and old blood collect in the ovary.  Patients can have lower abdominal pain; however, they typically have regular menses.  In addition, endometriosis is not associated with hot flashes, weight loss, or abnormal TSH levels. $#(Choice C)#  Granulosa cell tumors are a type of sex cord–stroma tumor that secrete estrogen and inhibin, thereby suppressing FSH release and causing irregular menses.  They do not secrete thyroid hormone and therefore do not cause thyrotoxicosis. $#(Choice D)#  @Ovarian fibromas@ are sex cord–stroma tumors that arise from ovarian fibroblasts, which have no endocrine activity and therefore do not affect TSH levels.  Fibromas are typically solid, not cystic. $#(Choice E)  #Ovarian thecomas are benign sex cord–stroma tumors composed of cells histologically similar to thecal cells.  Therefore, thecomas typically increase circulating estrogen (causing abnormal uterine bleeding) but do not cause thyrotoxicosis. $#Educational objective# Struma ovarii is an ovarian germ cell tumor composed of >50% mature thyroid tissue that can secrete thyroid hormone.  Therefore, struma ovarii can be a rare cause of thyrotoxicosis (eg, weight loss, irregular menses, low TSH level).  ",

Unlike SUI, vesicovaginal fistulas cause continuous urinary dribbling rather than intermittent urinary leakage, and pelvic examination shows leakage of urine from the vagina (not the urethra). $#(Choices C and D)#  The bladder receives both sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation to control continence and micturition.  Sympathetic stimulation promotes urine storage and continence by increasing urethral sphincter tone.  In contrast, parasympathetic activity stimulates detrusor muscle contraction and micturition.  Therefore, increased bladder sphincter sympathetic activity or reduced detrusor parasympathetic activity would promote continence rather than the urinary leakage seen in this patient. $#Educational objective# Stress urinary incontinence (intermittent, involuntary leakage of urine) is caused by weakened pelvic floor muscle support that often occurs due to chronically increased intraabdominal pressure (eg, obesity, chronic cough, prior pregnancies).

Because of this cancer's propensity to metastasize to the lymphatic system, most patients have lymph node involvement (eg, #axillary lymphadenopathy#) at the time of presentation. $#(Choice A)#  Deep venous thrombosis occurs due to hypercoagulability related to malignancy, surgery, or intravenous catheter placement.  Deep venous thrombosis most often affects the lower extremities but can also involve the upper extremities.  It presents with edema and pain in the affected limb. $#(Choice B)#  Rupture of a silicone breast implant can lead to a foreign body reaction with local inflammation (eg, edema, induration), and granuloma formation can result in a palpable, tender mass.  Although these findings can mimic inflammatory breast cancer, this patient's pitted skin texture (indicating lymphatic obstruction) and hard axillary lymph nodes make malignancy a more likely diagnosis. $#(Choice C)#  Mastitis (ie, breast infection) most commonly occurs in lactating women and presents with pain, breast swelling, and erythema.  Most patients also have systemic findings such as fever, malaise, and leukocytosis. $#(Choice E)#  Breast implant surgery requires surgical incisions that can leave scars on the breast skin.  A @hypertrophic@ scar is a thick, raised, and pink fibrous tissue line that follows the original incision.  @Keloid@ scars occur due to disorganized collagen deposits; they have a thick, rubbery appearance and extend outside the incision borders. $#Educational objective# Peau d'orange is an erythematous, itchy breast rash with skin texture changes that resemble an orange peel.  It is the key dermatologic presentation of inflammatory breast cancer and is caused by cancerous cells spreading to the dermal lymphatic spaces and obstructing lymphatic drainage.  ",

Right-sided torsion is more common because of the greater length of the right uteroovarian ligament and because the rectosigmoid colon takes up space around the left ovary (leaving less room for movement).

  "explanation_2": "$This patient has lower abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding.  In the setting of a #positive pregnancy test# (eg, detectable β-hCG) and an #adnexal mass#, her presentation is most concerning for #ectopic pregnancy#. $Following ovulation, the ovum normally travels along the length of the fallopian tube where it can be fertilized by a sperm cell.  The fertilized ovum continues through the fallopian tube, developing into a blastocyst, and subsequently implants on the uterine endometrium.  However, migration of the fertilized ovum is occasionally impeded, resulting in #implantation in the fallopian tube# (~90%) or other @extrauterine locations@.  Ectopic pregnancy often occurs secondary to tubal pathology (eg, pelvic inflammatory disease, prior pelvic surgery) but can present in patients without risk factors. $After implantation in the fallopian tube, the ectopic pregnancy develops into a highly vascular adnexal mass that draws blood flow from surrounding tissues to maintain its rapid growth.  This causes ischemic injury to surrounding tissues, fallopian tube edema, and potential tubal rupture, resulting in the classic symptoms of #pelvic cramping# and #vaginal bleeding# (eg, spotting). $#(Choice A)#  A hydatidiform mole can occur due to abnormal ovum fertilization by 2 sperm and may present with vaginal bleeding and adnexal enlargement (ie, theca lutein cyst formation due to β-hCG stimulation).  Patients typically have an enlarged uterus (due to abundant growth of chorionic villi) and markedly elevated β-hCG levels (>100,000 mIU/mL), neither of which is seen in this patient. $#(Choice B)#  Uterine leiomyoma (ie, @fibroids@) are tumors arising from benign proliferation of the myometrium.  Although they can cause cramping and vaginal bleeding, fibroids usually present with uterine enlargement or an abnormal uterine contour, which are not seen in this patient.  In addition, fibroids are not associated with elevated β-hCG levels. $#(Choice C)#  An endometrioma, or ectopic endometrial tissue in the ovary, can cause an adnexal mass and vaginal bleeding if ruptured.  However, patients typically have dysmenorrhea and additional symptoms associated with endometriosis (eg, dyspareunia, dyschezia). $#(Choice E)#  Ovarian torsion can occur in patients with a mature teratoma (an ovarian mass composed of ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm).  Although torsion can cause pelvic pain and a palpable adnexal mass, the pain is typically sudden and unilateral and vaginal bleeding is uncommon. $#Educational objective# Ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized embryo implants in an extrauterine location (eg, the fallopian tube).

The most common risk factor for endometrial hyperplasia/cancer is chronic unopposed estrogen exposure, which is associated with #obesity#, early menarche, late menopause, and chronic anovulation. $Postmenopausal women have decreased ovarian function (ie, low estrogen and progesterone production), resulting in cessation of endometrial proliferation and subsequent amenorrhea.  However, small amounts of androgens continue to be produced in the ovaries and adrenal glands after menopause.  In obese women, these androgens (eg, androstenedione) are readily converted to estrogens (eg, estrone) by the #aromatase# enzyme found #in adipose tissue#. $The increased peripheral production of estrogens in adipose tissue and the decrease in sex-hormone binding globulin levels (that normally occurs with menopause) lead to elevated free estrogen levels #(choice C).#  However, ovarian progesterone production remains low; therefore, the #unopposed estrogen# causes #unregulated endometrial proliferation# and subsequent endometrial hyperplasia or cancer, which often presents as postmenopausal or abnormal uterine bleeding. $#(Choice A)#  Hyperprolactinemia due to autonomous pituitary secretion of prolactin (ie, pituitary adenoma) causes negative feedback to the @hypothalamus@.  This results in decreased hypothalamic GnRH secretion, decreased pituitary FSH and LH secretion, and decreased estrogen and progesterone levels.  Therefore, premenopausal women often have signs of hyperprolactinemia (eg, galactorrhea) and hypoestrogenism (eg, amenorrhea).  In postmenopausal women, the most common symptom is tumor mass effect (eg, headache, bitemporal hemianopsia). $#(Choice B)#  @Endometriosis@, the ectopic implantation of endometrial glands and stroma, typically causes painful menses (ie, dysmenorrhea) due to inflamed tissue on the peritoneum.  Endometriosis is uncommon after menopause because it requires high premenopausal estrogen levels that do not occur even in obese women. $#(Choice E)#  Suppression of hypothalamic GnRH secretion (ie, hypothalamic hypogonadism) most commonly occurs in women with severe caloric restriction (eg, anorexia), excessive energy expenditure (eg, female athlete triad), or stress.  The decreased GnRH secretion results in decreased pituitary FSH and LH secretion and subsequent decreased ovarian estrogen and progesterone production.  Therefore, patients typically have amenorrhea rather than postmenopausal bleeding. $#Educational objective# Endometrial hyperplasia and cancer often present with postmenopausal bleeding.

In general, douching is not a significant risk factor for persistent HPV infection. $#Educational objective# Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections, particularly types 16 and 18, are the primary cause of cervical dysplasia and cancer.

Unlike primary genital herpes, primary syphilis typically presents with a painless genital ulcer with a clean base (@chancre@). $#(Choice C)#  Varicella-zoster virus also invades the dorsal root sensory ganglia, and reactivation causes herpes zoster (shingles).  One complication is postherpetic neuralgia (persistent pain after resolution of herpes zoster lesions).  Patients typically have a painful vesicular rash in a dermatomal distribution and no systemic involvement. $#(Choice E)#  Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection increases the risk of cervical and vulvar carcinoma.  Certain strains (HPV 6 and 11) can cause anogenital warts (@condylomata acuminata@), which are pink or skin-colored papules or verrucous lesions, not ulcers.  In addition, primary HPV infections do not cause fever or painful lymphadenopathy. $#Educational objective# Primary genital herpes (herpes simplex virus type 1 or 2 infection) presents as multiple, grouped vesicles on the genitals that progress to ulcers.  Primary infections can cause systemic symptoms (eg, fever, malaise) and painful inguinal lymphadenopathy.  Because HSV can invade and lie latent in the sacral dorsal root ganglia, patients are at risk for viral reactivation and recurrent genital lesions.  ",

C albicans is a normal component of vaginal flora and exists in balance with the predominant bacteria of the vaginal microbiome, gram-positive Lactobacillus spp.  #Alterations# in the balance of #vaginal microbiome# allow for excessive Candida proliferation and symptomatic #vulvovaginal candidiasis#.  Common triggers include: $• #Antibiotic use# $• High estrogen levels (eg, pregnancy, oral contraceptive pills) $• Systemic corticosteroid therapy $• Diabetes mellitus, particularly if uncontrolled $• Immunosuppression (eg, HIV) $Antibiotic use, as in this patient recently treated for a urinary tract infection, results in #decreased number of lactobacilli# and is the most common predisposing cause of Candida vaginitis.  Patients can develop vulvar, vaginal, and perianal inflammation that results in erythema; pruritus; and a thick, white, clumpy vaginal discharge.  Diagnosis is made via wet mount microscopy, which typically shows #budding yeast and pseudohyphae#. $#(Choice A)#  Decreased glycogen concentration in the vaginal epithelium is typical in postmenopausal and lactating women.  This occurs due to low estrogen levels and can result in atrophic vaginitis (eg, vaginal dryness, pruritis).  This patient's regular monthly menstrual cycles indicate adequate estrogen levels. $#(Choice C)#  Enterobial larva and egg deposition occurs with @pinworm infection@ (Enterobius vermicularis).  Although this common helminth infection causes perianal and vulvar pruritis that worsens at night, there is no association with thick, white vaginal discharge. $#(Choice D)#  Elevated (alkaline) vaginal pH (>4.5) is associated with bacterial vaginosis and Trichomonas@ vaginitis@, which cannot thrive under acidic conditions.  In contrast, C albicans readily adapts to its surrounding pH level; therefore, vaginal pH associated with Candida vaginitis is typically normal (3.8-4.5). $#(Choice E)#  Human papillomavirus can incorporate its DNA into anogenital, cervical, and vaginal epithelial cells.  As a result, patients can develop anogenital warts, dysplasia, and malignancy.  However, patients do not typically have an associated thick, white vaginal discharge. $#Educational objective# Antibiotic use alters the balance of normal vaginal flora (eg, decreases the number of gram-positive lactobacilli) and facilitates Candida overgrowth.  Patients can develop vulvovaginal candidiasis, which presents with vulvar/vaginal/perianal pruritis; erythema; and a thick, white vaginal discharge.  ",

In bacterial vaginosis, the addition of potassium hydroxide (KOH) to the vaginal discharge releases amines, causing a characteristic odor (eg, positive whiff test).  Vaginal pH is elevated in both bacterial vaginosis and trichomonas infection; therefore, pH testing is not specific for diagnosis. $#(Choice D)#  Urine culture is used to diagnose urinary tract infections, which can present with dysuria; however, patients do not have associated vaginal discharge. $#Educational objective# Trichomonas vaginalis is a sexually transmitted motile protozoan which can be seen on wet mount microscopy of vaginal discharge.

  "explanation_2": "$Reproductive-age women have monthly menstrual cycles (ovulation and bleeding) due to cyclic hormonal changes in the @hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis@ (HPO axis).  FSH and LH are gonadotropins released by the anterior pituitary.  FSH stimulates maturation of a dominant ovarian follicle, which produces estrogen.  During the late follicular phase (ie, midcycle), the increasing estrogen levels cause the hypothalamus to release GnRH in a specific pulsatile pattern that triggers the LH surge.  The LH surge then induces follicular rupture and oocyte release (ie, ovulation). $This patient with coarse chin hair likely has anovulatory infertility related to polycystic ovary syndrome.  Patients with anovulatory infertility often undergo #ovulation induction# therapy with exogenous gonadotropins (ie, FSH) to stimulate ovarian follicular development #(choice B).#  Once the follicles appear mature on ultrasound, patients receive an #injection of hCG#.  The hormones hCG, LH, FSH, and TSH share a common alpha subunit; in addition, the beta subunit of hCG is also structurally similar to the beta subunit of LH.  Due to this beta subunit similarity, hCG can bind to and activate the same receptors as LH.  Therefore, the hCG injection #mimics the LH surge# and acts as the #ovulation trigger#. $#(Choice A)#  Estrogen, produced by the dominant ovarian follicle, physiologically increases and peaks in the late follicular phase.  This change leads to the LH surge, follicular rupture, and ovulation.  Estrogen levels decrease with rupture of the dominant follicle. $#(Choice D)#  After ovulation, the remnants of the dominant follicle form the corpus luteum, which secretes progesterone.  Progesterone induces endometrial decidualization in preparation for pregnancy implantation.  An implanted pregnancy will secrete hCG as a signal to the ovary to maintain the corpus luteum until the placenta can take over progesterone production.  If no pregnancy implants, the corpus luteum regresses and progesterone decreases. $#(Choice E)#  Testosterone is produced in the adrenal glands and ovarian theca cells.  Testosterone production within theca cells increases slightly during the late follicular phase in response to the LH surge. $#Educational objective# Anovulatory infertility can be treated with ovulation induction therapy, which may include a course of gonadotropins to stimulate the ovarian follicles.  Once the follicles mature, patients are administered an injection of hCG, which mimics the LH surge and acts as the ovulation trigger.  ",

  "explanation_2": "$Menstruation occurs due to fluctuating estrogen and progesterone levels, which regulate the endometrium.  Progesterone is secreted during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and transforms the endometrium from proliferative to secretory to promote pregnancy implantation.  Endometrial glands become more elaborate, and the spiral arteries, which supply the stratum functionalis, elongate and coil.  Exogenous progesterone intake for 10 days similarly matures the endometrium. $When the endometrium is no longer exposed to progesterone (ie, #progesterone withdrawal#), local prostaglandin production increases.  This causes uterine contractions (eg, cramping), leading to #compression/constriction of the spiral arteries#.  In response to decreased blood supply, the cells in the stratum functionalis undergo programmed cell death, or #apoptosis#.  Progesterone withdrawal also causes endometrial stromal cells to secrete metalloproteases, causing degradation of the extracellular matrix.  The net effect is degeneration of the stratum functionalis, which sloughs away as #menstrual blood flow#.  The stratum basalis remains intact (as it is supplied by the straight, not spiral, arteries), allowing for regeneration of the stratum functionalis during the next proliferative phase. $#(Choice B)#  Dysplasia is the abnormal growth of cells, tissues, or organs.  In epithelial tissues such as the transformation zone of the cervix, dysplasia is an early form of precancer. $#(Choice C)#  Granulation refers to the formation of new connective tissue and capillaries as part of the wound healing process.  Intrauterine procedures or infection can result in proliferation of granulation tissue with subsequent endometrial scarring and formation of fibrous adhesions (ie, @Asherman syndrome@). $#(Choice D)#  Hyperplasia is increased cell number due to increased cell proliferation.  Endometrial hyperplasia can cause abnormal (eg, intermenstrual, prolonged) uterine bleeding if the overly proliferative, thickened endometrium outgrows its blood supply.  However, the immediate cause of bleeding in this patient is cellular apoptosis triggered by withdrawal of progesterone. $#(Choice E)#  Hypertrophy is the enlargement of tissue due to increased cell size without increased cell proliferation.  Patients with @adenomyosis@ have hypertrophy of the surrounding uterine smooth muscle cells, which results in a uniformly enlarged, globular uterus. $#(Choice F)#  Invagination (inward folding) of epithelial cells occurs during embryonic development (gastrulation) to form structures such as the @neural tube@.  It is not associated with menstruation. $#Educational objective# Progesterone is secreted during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and transforms the endometrium from proliferative to secretory.  Progesterone withdrawal causes endometrial cells in the stratum functionalis to undergo apoptosis, resulting in menstrual bleeding.  ",

  "explanation_2": "$This patient with #short stature# (height <3rd percentile) has #delayed puberty# (ie, no breast development by age 12) and dysmorphic features (eg, low hairline, short/wide neck, widely spaced nipples).  This constellation of findings is characteristic of @Turner syndrome@ (TS), a sex chromosome disorder due to #loss of an X chromosome#.  Because the X chromosome contains a short stature homeobox (SHOX) gene, which normally promotes long bone growth, patients often present with declining linear velocity, as seen in this girl. $Aneuploidy (abnormal chromosome number), as in TS, is most often caused by #meiotic nondisjunction# during gametogenesis.  Meiotic nondisjunction refers to failed separation of homologous chromosomes (meiosis I) or sister chromatids (meiosis II), which results in a gamete with an abnormal number of chromosomes (eg, 22, 24).  When a gamete lacking an X chromosome is fertilized with a gamete containing a normal number of chromosomes, the embryo has a 45,X genotype. $Alternately, absence of an X chromosome may be due to mitotic nondisjunction after fertilization.  This results in somatic mosaicism, in which the X chromosome is missing in only some cells (45,X/46,XX), and a milder TS phenotype. $#(Choice A)#  Balanced translocations are clinically silent because genetic material is exchanged between nonhomologous chromosomes but not lost.  Affected individuals can have offspring with unbalanced translocations (eg, @trisomy 21@).  However, autosomal translocation would not cause Turner's syndrome. $#(Choice B)#  Frameshift mutation occurs when a number of nucleotides not evenly divisible by 3 are inserted into or deleted from a sequence of coding DNA.  The reading frame is shifted during translation, creating a different peptide sequence. $#(Choice D)#  Skewed X-chromosome inactivation occurs when one X chromosome is inactivated more often than would occur by chance alone.  However, because many of the genes that contribute to TS (eg, SHOX) normally escape X inactivation, findings of TS are not typical with this mechanism. $#(Choice E)#  Uniparental disomy occurs when both copies of a chromosome are inherited from 1 parent.  Disease occurs when the inherited chromosomes contain genes that are physiologically imprinted (silenced), and gene expression normally relies on the other parent's genes (which are absent), as in Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome. $#Educational objective# Turner syndrome is characterized by loss of an X chromosome, most often due to meiotic nondisjunction during gametogenesis.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient's posterior neck mass is most likely a multiloculated #cystic hygroma#, which develops when obstruction of the lymphatic system causes lymph to accumulate in the jugular lymphatic sacs of the neck.  Impaired flow can also cause extravasation of fluid from lymphatic vessels into the interstitial space of the hands and feet, resulting in #congenital lymphedema#, as seen in this patient with nonpitting extremity edema. $In a newborn girl with @cystic hygroma@ and/or @congenital lymphedema@, chromosomal aneuploidy should be suspected.  In this case, the patient's #diminished femoral pulses# (which raise clinical suspicion for #aortic coarctation#) and characteristic dysmorphic features (eg, high-arched palate, low-set ears) strongly suggest #Turner syndrome# (TS).  Other manifestations of TS include a webbed neck with low hairline and a broad chest with widely spaced nipples. $TS is caused by complete or partial #loss of an X chromosome# (most commonly the paternal copy).  Although genotypically normal females (46,XX) undergo X-inactivation (random silencing of one X chromosome in a given cell), some genes on the silenced X chromosome normally escape inactivation; in males, these genes also have homologous counterparts on the Y chromosome.  Therefore, females with only one X chromosome are missing 1 of the normal 2 copies, causing a #decreased gene dosage# effect that impacts genes such as SHOX (short-stature homeobox gene) and those responsible for lymphatic development. $#(Choice A)#  A trinucleotide repeat expansion causing loss of function of the FMR1 gene on chromosome X is responsible for @fragile X syndrome@.  Neonates may have dysmorphic features (eg, prominent ears), but diminished femoral pulses and cystic neck mass are not associated findings. $#(Choices C and E)#  Cystic hygromas and lymphedema can occur with trisomies such as Edwards syndrome (typically caused by meiotic nondisjunction of chromosome 18) and Down syndrome (usually caused by nondisjunction or robertsonian translocation of chromosome 21).  However, patients with @Edwards syndrome@ typically have hypertonia, clenched fists, and rocker-bottom feet, and patients with @Down syndrome@ characteristically have upslanting palpebral fissures, epicanthal folds, and a single palmar crease.  Down syndrome is also more likely to cause a murmur due to an atrioventricular canal defect rather than diminished pulses. $#(Choice D)#  Cri-du-chat syndrome is due to a partial deletion of the short arm of chromosome 5.  Patients typically have a round face, cat-like cry, and microcephaly (not cystic hygroma or lymphedema). $#Educational objective# Turner syndrome (loss of an X chromosome) should be suspected in a newborn girl with cystic hygroma or lymphedema.

In addition, patients with AIS have cryptorchid testes that actively secrete antimüllerian hormone, leading to complete regression of all müllerian structures with an absent (not rudimentary) uterus. $#(Choice C)#  @Kallmann syndrome@ occurs due to decreased synthesis of GnRH in the hypothalamus (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism).  Although female patients are rarely affected, they can have primary amenorrhea but typically do not develop secondary sexual characteristics. $#(Choice D)#  @Klinefelter syndrome@ (47,XXY) affects males and is characterized by tall stature, poorly developed secondary sexual characteristics, atrophic testes, and infertility. $#Educational objective# Patients with müllerian agenesis (ie, Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome) have variable uterine development and no upper vagina (eg, shortened vagina).  These patients are 46,XX females with normal ovaries and secondary sexual characteristics.  ",

In preparation for #labor#, increasing #estrogen# levels stimulate upregulation of connexin 43, increasing formation of gap junctions between individual myometrial cells.  An #increase in gap junction density# allows the passage of small ions between neighboring myometrial cells, resulting in coordinated, synchronous labor contractions. $Estrogen also increases the expression of uterotonic #oxytocin receptors#, Gq–coupled membrane receptors that increase intracellular calcium levels, heightening myometrial excitability. $#(Choices A and B)#  Both adherens junctions and desmosomes are composed of @cadherins@, which are calcium-dependent adhesion proteins that bind epithelial cells together.  The cytoplasmic anchor of adherens junctions is the actin filament, whereas the cytoplasmic anchor of desmosomes is the intermediate filament.  Autoantibodies against desmoglein, a cadherin protein for desmosomes, are found in pemphigus vulgaris. $#(Choice C)#  Fenestrae are transcellular pores within endothelial cells that facilitate increased solute exchange.  They are found in capillaries perfusing the intestine, renal tubules, and endocrine glands. $#(Choice E)#  Hemidesmosomes are similar to desmosomes but link cells to the basement membrane via integrins, transmembrane anchor proteins.  Autoantibodies to hemidesmosomes cause bullous pemphigoid and pemphigoid gestationis. $#(Choice F)#  Tight junctions (zonula occludens), composed of claudins and occludin, prevent paracellular passage of fluid and solutes.  Tight junctions between capillary endothelial cells help form the blood-brain barrier. $#Educational objective# Gap junctions facilitate communication and coordination between cells and play an important role in labor contractions.

Adenomyosis is common in multiparous women, and prior uterine surgery (eg, cesarean delivery) is a risk factor. $Although the exact pathogenesis is unclear, adenomyosis may occur due to endometrial invagination into the myometrium during periods of myometrial weakening or changes in vascularity at the endomyometrial interface (eg, pregnancy, uterine surgery).  The clinical features of adenomyosis reflect its pathophysiology: $• endometrial gland proliferation and cyclic bleeding within the myometrium leads to #dysmenorrhea# and #uterine tenderness# $• abnormal myometrial hyperplasia and hypertrophy results in a concentric, #uniformly enlarged uterus# $• uterine enlargement and subsequently increased endometrial surface area causes #regular, heavy menstrual bleeding# $Definitive therapy is with hysterectomy, which allows for histologic diagnosis. $#(Choice A)#  Leiomyomas (ie, uterine fibroids) are benign myometrial smooth muscle cell tumors.  Although fibroids can cause regular, heavy menses (also due to increased endometrial surface area), the uterus is typically nontender and @irregularly enlarged@ rather than tender and uniformly enlarged. $#(Choice B)#  An @ectopic pregnancy@ most commonly occurs due to abnormal blastocyst implantation in the fallopian tube.  Although prior tubal surgery (eg, bilateral tubal ligation) is a risk factor, ectopic pregnancy is unlikely in this patient with a negative urine β-hCG.  In addition, uterine enlargement would not be seen. $#(Choice D)#  @Endometrial polyps@ are benign, intracavitary, focal hyperplastic growths of endometrial tissue.  In contrast to adenomyosis, endometrial polyps cause painless intermenstrual bleeding rather than painful, cyclic, heavy menses.  There is also no associated uterine tenderness or enlargement. $#(Choice E)#  Patients with endometrial hyperplasia have unregulated endometrial gland proliferation with increased gland-to-stroma ratio; the thickened endometrial lining may slightly increase uterine size and cause heavy menses.  However, endometrial hyperplasia does not typically cause dysmenorrhea or uterine tenderness.  In addition, the most common risk factor is unopposed estrogen from chronic anovulation and/or obesity; this patient has regular menses and a normal BMI. $#Educational objective# Adenomyosis is the abnormal presence of endometrial glands and stroma within the uterine myometrium.  Affected patients are typically multiparous women with dysmenorrhea, heavy menses, and a uniformly enlarged uterus.  ",
