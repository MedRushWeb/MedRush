During fetal development, the testes originate within the retroperitoneum and establish their arterial supply from the abdominal aorta. The testes subsequently descend through the inguinal canals into the scrotum, taking with them their arterial, venous, and lymphatic supplies. Thus, lymph from the testes drains through lymph channels directly back to the para-aortic lymph nodes.\n\n$(Choice A) The superficial inguinal lymph nodes are located on the anterior thigh inferior to the inguinal ligament. These nodes drain nearly all cutaneous structures inferior to the umbilicus, including the external genitalia and the anus up to the pectinate line.\n\n$(Choice B) The deep inguinal nodes reside under the fascia lata on the medial side of the femoral vein. They receive afferents from the superficial inguinal nodes and deep lymphatic trunks along the femoral vessels. The lymphatics from the glans penis and clitoris also drain directly to these nodes.\n\n$(Choice C) The external iliac nodes drain the superficial and deep inguinal nodes and the deep lymphatics of the abdominal wall below the umbilicus.\n\n$(Choice D) The common iliac nodes are located alongside the common iliac artery and drain the internal and external iliac nodes.\n\n$(Choice E) The inferior mesenteric nodes drain the structures supplied with arterial blood by branches of the inferior mesenteric artery (eg, the left colic, sigmoid, and superior rectal arteries).

In addition, he has #hypertension# that has not been well controlled.  When possible, it is desirable to choose drugs that can address multiple issues to minimize adverse effects and drug interactions. $In this patient, an #alpha-1 blocker# (eg, doxazosin, prazosin, terazosin) can be used to #treat both# the BPH symptoms and the hypertension.  Although alpha-1 blockers are not first-line medications for hypertension, they can be useful second-line drugs in hypertensive patients with concomitant BPH. $Alpha-1 blockers work by #relaxing smooth muscle# in the @bladder neck and prostate@, opening up the bladder outlet and decreasing the resistance to the flow of urine.  They also relax smooth muscle tone in #arterial walls#, thus decreasing blood pressure.  Uroselective alpha-1 blockers (specific for alpha-1A subtype), such as alfuzosin, silodosin, and tamsulosin, affect only the urinary tract smooth muscles; therefore, they would not be helpful in decreasing blood pressure #(choice F).# $#(Choice B)#  Finasteride is a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor that is effective for the treatment of BPH but has no effect on blood pressure.  It works by inhibiting the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, the hormone that causes progressive glandular enlargement in BPH.  After being administered for several months, finasteride decreases the size of the prostate. $#(Choice C)#  Hydralazine is a powerful, typically third-line antihypertensive that works by relaxing smooth muscles in the arterial walls.  It would not be useful in the treatment of BPH. $#(Choice D)#  Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic that functions at the distal convoluted tubule of the nephron to prevent the reabsorption of sodium, chloride and water by blocking a Na/Cl co-transporter.  It is one of the first-line medications for the treatment of primary hypertension.  Diuretics have no role in the treatment of BPH. $#(Choice E)#  Metoprolol is a selective beta-1-receptor blocker used to treat hypertension and coronary artery disease.  It works by blocking adrenergic stimulation of the heart, causing the heart to contract less forcefully and less frequently.  Beta-1-receptor blockers would not help with BPH symptoms. $#Educational objective# Alpha-1 blockers such as doxazosin, prazosin, and terazosin are useful for the treatment of both benign prostatic hyperplasia and hypertension.  To minimize adverse effects and drug interactions, it is desirable to prescribe a medication that can address multiple issues at once.  ","clickable_1":"images/img1.150.jpg"},

The #Sertoli cells# are connected by a continuous barrier of #tight junctions#, forming a functional boundary between the outer basal compartment and the inner luminal compartment of the tubule.  These tight junctions form the #blood-testis barrier# (BTB), which controls the environment of the developing spermatids and prevents immune exposure. $Undifferentiated germ cells (@spermatogonia@) reside along the basal lamina, between the Sertoli cells, and outside the BTB.  The spermatogonia are continually replenished by mitosis.  During differentiation, spermatozoa pass through the barrier, which reforms behind them.  Disruption to the BTB (eg, due to trauma or ischemia) can lead to formation of antisperm antibodies, which can impair fertility. $#(Choice A)#  Leydig cells produce a high local concentration of testosterone, which diffuses into the nearby seminiferous tubules and facilitates spermatogenesis.  However, the Leydig cells are outside the tubules and do not form the BTB. $#(Choices B and C)#  Primary and secondary spermatocytes are postmeiotic cells derived from spermatogonia.  They migrate between the Sertoli cells, inside the BTB, but are not found in a continuous layer and do not form the BTB. $#(Choice E)#  The @tunica albuginea@ of the testis is a thick connective tissue structure that forms the outer capsule of the testis within the scrotum.
