      "explanation_2": "This patient's presentation is consistent with #subclavian steal syndrome#, which typically occurs due to hemodynamically significant stenosis of the subclavian artery proximal to the origin of the vertebral artery. #Subclavian stenosis# is typically caused by atherosclerosis, although less common etiologies include Takayasu arteritis and complications from heart surgery (eg, aortic coarctation repair). The lowered distal subclavian arterial pressure leads to reversal in blood flow (\"steal\") from the contralateral vertebral artery to the ipsilateral vertebral artery, away from the brainstem.$Most patients with subclavian artery stenosis are asymptomatic. When symptoms occur, they are typically related to #arm ischemia# in the affected extremity (eg, exercise-induced fatigue, pain, paresthesias) or #vertebrobasilar insufficiency# (eg, dizziness, vertigo, drop attacks). Physical examination can show a significant difference (>15 mm Hg) in brachial systolic blood pressure between the affected arm and normal arm. Doppler ultrasound of the cerebrovascular and upper extremity arterial circulation establishes the diagnosis in most patients.$(Choice A) Although innominate (brachiocephalic) artery stenosis or occlusion can cause subclavian steal syndrome, patients with significant occlusion would develop retrograde flow through the right vertebral artery rather than the left.$(Choice B) Internal carotid artery occlusion may occur due to thrombosis or embolism, leading to a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or ischemic stroke. Patients typically have profound neurologic deficits (eg, contralateral homonymous hemianopsia, hemiparesis, hemisensory loss), including cortical signs (eg, aphasia, agnosia, neglect). Blood flow reversal in the vertebral artery is not characteristic.$(Choice C) Coronary-subclavian steal phenomenon occurs in patients with prior coronary artery bypass surgery using the internal mammary artery (IMA). Similar to that of subclavian steal syndrome, blood flow through the IMA can reverse and steal flow from the coronary circulation during increased demand (eg, upper extremity exercise). However, symptoms are typically related to coronary ischemia (eg, angina pectoris).$(Choice E) Right vertebral artery occlusion usually leads to ischemic stroke or TIA and can cause similar symptoms as seen in this patient. However, occlusion of the right vertebral artery would cause retrograde flow on the right versus the left, and symptoms are not typically precipitated by arm exertion.$Educational objective Subclavian steal syndrome occurs due to severe stenosis of the proximal subclavian artery, which leads to reversal in blood flow from the contralateral vertebral artery to the ipsilateral vertebral artery. Patients may have symptoms related to arm ischemia in the affected extremity (eg, exercise-induced fatigue, pain, paresthesias) or vertebrobasilar insufficiency (eg, dizziness, vertigo)."

    "explanation_2": "$The @coronary circulation@ is composed of 3 major epicardial vessels. $• The #left anterior descending# artery (LAD) arises from the left main artery and courses down the anterior heart, supplying the anterior left ventricular (LV) wall and septum. $• The #left circumflex# artery (LCx) arises from the left main artery and courses around the left side of the heart to supply the lateral LV wall.  Occasionally, the LCx extends all the way around the heart to supply the inferior LV wall (left-dominance). $• The #right coronary# artery (RCA) comes directly off the aorta and courses around the right side of the heart to supply the right ventricle (RV).  In most patients, the RCA extends past the RV to also supply the inferior LV wall (right-dominance). $Blood supply to the #inferior LV wall# depends on coronary artery #dominance#.  Right coronary dominance is present in approximately 85% of patients and involves the RCA coursing past the RV to give off the posterior descending artery (PDA) and supply the inferior LV wall.  Left coronary dominance is present in approximately 10% of patients and involves the LCx extending around the left side of the heart to give off the PDA and supply the inferior LV wall.  Approximately 5% of patients have codominant circulation. $In virtually all patients, the RV is fully supplied by the RCA, and in patients with left-dominant circulation, none of the inferior LV wall is supplied by the RCA.  Therefore, #isolated RV myocardial infarction# (MI) can occur due to #RCA occlusion# in a patient with #left-dominant circulation#.  Given the low prevalence of left-dominant circulation, isolated RV MI is an uncommon event (approximately 3% of MIs). $#(Choices A, B, C, and D)#  The LAD and LCx do not supply the RV and are not involved in RV MI. $#(Choice F)#  With right-dominant circulation, the RCA supplies the inferior LV wall.  Therefore, RCA occlusion would cause MI involving the RV and the inferior LV wall, or the inferior LV wall alone if the occlusion is distal to the RV. $#Educational objective# Blood supply to the inferior left ventricular (LV) wall is determined by coronary dominance.  Most patients have right-dominant circulation, in which the inferior LV wall is supplied by the right coronary artery.  Approximately 10% of patients have left-dominant circulation, in which the inferior LV wall is supplied by the left circumflex artery.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient most likely has a #patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)#. The ductus arteriosus is an embryonic derivative of the #sixth aortic arch# that allows fetal blood to pass directly from the pulmonary artery to the proximal descending aorta (bypassing the pulmonary circulation). This vessel usually closes shortly after birth, secondary to decreased #prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)# levels and increased oxygen concentration. Patency of the ductus after birth results in a left-to-right shunt that can cause left ventricular volume overload and symptoms of heart failure (eg, failure to thrive, respiratory distress). Physical examination will show a continuous \"machinery-like\" murmur and palpable thrill over the left infraclavicular region due to turbulent blood flow through the PDA.$Pharmacologic closure of a PDA can be achieved by PGE2 synthesis inhibitors (eg, indomethacin) in premature infants. However, older patients usually require surgical ligation or percutaneous PDA occlusion.$(Choice A) The bulbus cordis forms the beginning of the ventricular outflow tract in the embryonic heart. This structure forms the smooth portions of the left and right ventricles adjacent to the aorta and pulmonary artery, respectively.$(Choice B) The fourth aortic arch on the left forms the arch of the aorta between the left carotid artery and ductus arteriosus. Abnormalities during development can result in coarctation (narrowing) of the aorta, which can present with continuous murmurs over the back due to collateral formation.$(Choice C) The primitive atrium receives blood from the sinus venosus in the embryonic heart and transmits it to the primitive ventricle. The primitive atrium forms the rough portions of the left and right atria.$(Choice D) The sinus venosus is an embryologic structure within the heart that receives blood from the vena cava. In adults, this structure forms the smooth portion of the right atrium, known as the sinus venarum.$Educational objective The ductus arteriosus is derived from the sixth embryonic aortic arch. A patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) causes left-to-right shunting of blood that can be heard as a continuous murmur over the left infraclavicular region.

Viral infection is the most common cause of acute pericarditis, with coxsackievirus (types A and B) and echovirus being the most common organisms.  Patients with pericarditis typically experience chest pain, which may be intermittent (as in this patient) but is often pleuritic and/or positional (eg, relieved by leaning forward). $As in this patient, viral pericarditis can be #complicated by pericardial effusion# due to fibrinous or serofibrinous pericardial inflammation.

In addition, pericardial effusion often causes the following clinical findings: $• #Tachycardia# to compensate for decreased ventricular filling $• #Low voltage QRS# on ECG and diminished heart sounds to auscultation due to pericardial fluid accumulation increasing the distance between the heart and the ECG leads or stethoscope $• #Electrical alternans# on ECG due to the swinging motion of the heart in the fluid-filled pericardial cavity, causing a beat-to-beat variation in the QRS axis $Patients with pericardial effusion classically have an #enlarged, globular cardiac silhouette# on #chest x-ray#, which occurs when progressive pericardial stretching over days to weeks (ie, subacute course) allows large volumes (eg, up to 1-2 L) of pericardial fluid to accumulate.  #Clear lung fields# are typically seen because the increase in pericardial pressure (due to pericardial fluid accumulation) affects the lower pressure, right-sided heart chambers more than the left-sided heart chambers.

    "explanation_2": "$ This patient has @clinical features@ of #Marfan syndrome#, an autosomal dominant disorder caused by #mutations# in the FBN1 gene encoding #fibrillin-1#, a main component of extracellular matrix microfibrils.  Fibrillin-1 provides support to elastic fibers and helps maintain connective tissue integrity.  It also regulates extracellular matrix remodelling by binding to and sequestering #transforming growth factor-beta# (TGF-beta). $ In Marfan syndrome, defective fibrillin-1 is unable to bind TGF-beta.  The resulting #overexpression# of free, active TGF-beta leads to increased production of matrix metalloproteinases, which cleave elastic fibers and other components of the extracellular matrix, #reducing tissue integrity#.  Within the mitral valve, this process results in fragmentation of elastic fibers and decreased collagen density with pooling of glycosaminoglycans (#myxomatous mitral degeneration#). $ The elongated, floppy mitral valve leaflets #prolapse# into the atrium, which causes a midsystolic click on auscultation and allows for @mitral valve regurgitation@.  This regurgitant flow is characterized by a #mid-to-late systolic apical murmur#, as seen in this patient; severe regurgitation may produce a holosystolic murmur. $ (Choice A)  Although aortic root dilation is common with Marfan syndrome, the associated aortic regurgitation causes a decrescendo diastolic murmur. $ (Choice B)  Aortic valve cusp fusion (ie, bicuspid aortic valve) is commonly associated with @Turner syndrome@, not Marfan syndrome.  Auscultatory findings are attributed to aortic stenosis (systolic crescendo-decrescendo murmur at the right upper sternal border) and/or aortic regurgitation (diastolic murmur along the left sternal border). $ (Choice C)  Endocardial fibrous deposition occurs with carcinoid heart disease.  In contrast to this case, presentation includes right-sided heart failure (eg, edema, hepatomegaly), and common murmurs include tricuspid regurgitation (ie, holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border) and pulmonic regurgitation (ie, diastolic decrescendo murmur). $ (Choice E)  Papillary muscle dysfunction, which is typically the result of myocardial ischemia/infarction, can cause mitral regurgitation (ie, holosystolic murmur).  Marfan syndrome is not associated with papillary muscle dysfunction. $ Educational objective Marfan syndrome is a connective tissue disorder in which defective fibrillin-1 decreases tissue integrity and increases expression of transforming growth factor-beta.  Cardiac effects include myxomatous degeneration and prolapse of the mitral valve with associated regurgitation, which manifests as a midsystolic click and mid-to-late systolic murmur.",

    "explanation_2": "$#Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm# (AAA) is a surgical emergency involving full-thickness compromise of the aortic wall with extravasation of blood into surrounding tissues and spaces.  The #acute onset# of #severe abdominal and back pain# is the most common presenting symptom.  In general, anterior rupture into the #peritoneal cavity# is quickly accompanied by #syncope#, hypotension, and shock, whereas posterior rupture into the retroperitoneum may be temporarily contained, resulting in delayed onset of hemodynamic instability.  Other signs suggesting AAA rupture include abdominal distension, a pulsatile abdominal mass, and umbilical or flank hematoma (indicators of retroperitoneal hemorrhage). $ Early detection of AAA can be difficult because patients frequently have few symptoms until the AAA either ruptures or markedly expands.  Therefore, ruptured AAA should be suspected in patients with consistent symptoms and known #risk factors#, which include advanced age (>60), #smoking#, male sex, and a history of atherosclerosis or connective tissue disease.  @CT imaging@ can confirm the diagnosis, but hemodynamically unstable patients with suspected ruptured AAA should go straight to emergent surgical repair. $ (Choice A)  Acute mesenteric ischemia has similar risk factors to AAA.  Patients typically describe severe abdominal pain but have few findings on physical examination (eg, minimal tenderness)  and hypotension and syncope are not usually seen. $(Choice B)  Colonic perforation can be due to diverticulitis, malignancy, or complications from colonoscopy.  Patients can develop hypotension due to sepsis, but signs of infection (eg, fever) and peritonitis (eg, rebound, guarding) are also expected. $ (Choice C)  Renal colic is characterized by episodic (eg, every 30 min) flank or groin pain due to capsular stretch from nephrolithiasis-associated obstruction.  Hypotension and syncope are not typical features. $ (Choice E)  Vertebral compression fractures can cause acute back pain exacerbated by minimal movement (eg, coughing, bending).  Although the pain can occasionally refer to the abdomen, it is most commonly at the midline over the spinous processes.  There should not be associated hypotension. $ Educational objective Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm is a surgical emergency that usually presents with the acute onset of severe abdominal and back pain in patients with appropriate risk factors (eg, advanced age, smoking, atherosclerosis).

    "explanation_2": "$This patient's presentation is most consistent with aortic dissection, which is characterized by severe retrosternal chest pain radiating to the mid-to-upper back that can move downward as the dissection progresses.  It is initiated by a #tear in the aortic intima# that typically extends for about 1-5 cm in a transverse or oblique direction.  The dissection can progress both proximally and distally as blood is forced through the tear, bisecting through the aortic media.  Dissections involving any portion of the ascending aorta are classified as type A; those confined to the descending aorta are classified as type B.  As the dissecting intramural hematoma spreads along the aortic wall, it can compress major arterial branches.  This patient's brachial #blood pressure discrepancy# suggests compromise of the brachiocephalic trunk servicing his right arm. $ #Hypertension# is the primary risk factor for aortic dissection.  In many patients with longstanding hypertension, there is medial hypertrophy of the aortic vasa vasorum and, consequently, reduced blood flow to the aortic media.  This can cause medial degeneration with a loss of smooth muscle cells, leading to aortic enlargement and increased wall stiffness.  Both of these changes exacerbate aortic wall stress, which is already increased due to the hypertension itself.  This synergistic increase in aortic wall stress greatly increases the risk of intimal tearing and subsequent development of aortic dissection. $ (Choice A)  An intimal fatty streak is the initial lesion of atherosclerosis.  Some fatty streaks progress to frank atheromas, which can progressively weaken the underlying media of the aortic wall.  However, atherosclerosis predisposes more to aortic aneurysm formation than to aortic dissection. $ (Choice C)  Monckeberg sclerosis (@medial calcific sclerosis@) is a form of arteriosclerosis characterized by calcific deposits in the medial layer of muscular arteries.  These lesions generally occur in patients age >50 and are thought to cause isolated systolic hypertension due to arterial hardening. $ #(Choices D and E)#  Aortitis with medial inflammation can be caused by autoimmune conditions such as Takayasu and giant cell arteritis.  #Tertiary syphilis# can also cause a form of aortitis characterized by #obliterative endarteritis# of the vasa vasorum.  These conditions weaken the aortic wall and can predispose to aortic aneurysms and, rarely, dissections.  However, hypertension is a more important risk factor for the development of intimal tearing, the primary triggering event of an aortic dissection. $ Educational objective Aortic dissection classically presents with severe retrosternal pain that radiates to the back.  This condition develops when overwhelming hemodynamic stress leads to tearing of the aortic intima with blood subsequently dissecting through the aortic media.  The resulting intramural hematoma can extend both proximally and distally and can compress major arterial branches and impair blood flow.",

    "explanation_2": "$@Click here for posterior view@.$This patient presents with symptoms and ECG findings consistent with transmural ischemic injury to the inferior wall of the heart.  In 90% of individuals, the posteroinferior wall of the left ventricle is supplied by the posterior descending branch of the right coronary artery (RCA).  The patient's bradycardia and resultant hypotension suggests that there may have been ischemic injury to the sinus node as well.  (The sinus node normally receives its arterial blood supply from the RCA.) $ #(Choices A, B, and C)#  The left main coronary artery gives rise to the left anterior descending (LAD) and the left circumflex (LCX) coronary arteries.  The LAD supplies the interventricular septum and the anterior wall of the left ventricle.  Transmural ischemia of the septum would produce ST elevation mainly in leads V1 and V2.  Infranodal (Mobitz type II) second-degree or third-degree heart block is a possible result as well; but sinus bradycardia would not occur with this type of injury.  Transmural ischemia of the anterior left ventricular wall would produce ST elevations mainly in leads V3 and V4.  An occlusion of the proximal LAD would cause anteroseptal transmural ischemia, with ST elevations in leads V1–V4. $ The LCX supplies the lateral wall of the left ventricle.  Transmural ischemia secondary to LCX occlusion would produce ST elevations mainly in leads V5 and V6, and possibly also in leads I and aVL.  An occlusion of the left main coronary artery would therefore be expected to produce widespread transmural ischemia of the interventricular septum and left ventricle, with ST elevations in all of the chest (V) leads, and possibly also in leads I and aVL. $ (Choice E)  Intramural arteries in the substance of the myocardium are unlikely sites of occlusion because, unlike the epicardial coronary arteries, they are rarely affected by atherosclerosis.  Moreover, if occlusion of intramural arteries did occur, subendocardial ischemia (with associated ST depression) would be more likely than transmural ischemia (with ST elevation). $ Educational Objective In 90% of individuals, occlusion of the right coronary artery can result in transmural ischemia of the inferior wall of the left ventricle, producing ST elevation in leads II, III, and aVF as well as possible sinus node dysfunction.  Occlusion of the proximal LAD would be expected to result in anteroseptal transmural ischemia, with ST elevations in leads V1–V4.  Occlusion of the LCX would produce transmural ischemia of the lateral wall of the left ventricle, with ST elevations mainly in V5 and V6, and possibly also in I and aVL.",

Autopsy findings reveal #uniformly thickened# left ventricular (LV) walls and a small LV cavity, which are consistent with concentric LV hypertrophy. $ @Concentric LV hypertrophy@ most commonly results from prolonged #systemic hypertension# as myocardial fibers are added in parallel to increase contractile strength and handle the increased pressure load.  As concentric hypertrophy worsens, it can manifest clinically as #hypertensive heart disease#, consisting of #impaired diastolic filling# and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.  The elevated diastolic filling pressures are transmitted back to the left atrium, causing atrial dilation and altered conduction that predisposes to #atrial fibrillation#.  Loss of atrial contraction can lead to a dramatic #reduction in left ventricular filling# in patients with diastolic heart failure and can precipitate #acute decompensation# (as likely occurred in this patient). $ On histopathology, h ypertensive heart disease demonstrates transverse thickening of cardiomyocytes with prominent hyperchromatic nuclei.  The increased myocardial mass may be inadequately supplied with oxygen, contributing to cellular necrosis and interstitial fibrosis. $ (Choice A)  Cardiac amyloidosis involves deposition of abnormal proteins in the myocardium and can lead to restrictive cardiomyopathy, which is characterized by impaired diastolic filling due to stiffening, rather than thickening, of the ventricular walls.

The elevated pressure load on the right ventricle can lead to concentric right ventricular hypertrophy and right-sided heart failure.  Pulmonary edema is not present in right-sided heart failure. $ Educational objective Concentric left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy involves uniform thickening of the LV walls with reduction in LV cavity size and most commonly results from prolonged systemic hypertension.

Common causes of right-sided heart failure include obstruction of pulmonary circulation (eg, pulmonary arterial hypertension, pulmonary embolism) and #right ventricular infarction# (likely in this patient due to multiple cardiovascular risk factors). $ In right ventricular infarction, the right ventricle is unable to effectively pump blood forward into the pulmonary arteries, causing increased pressure in the right atrium (ie, elevated central venous pressure).  The decreased right ventricular outflow also lowers PCWP (an indicator of left-sided preload), which subsequently reduces cardiac output and causes hypotension.  A reflexive increase in heart rate is mostly intact in this patient, though it is often impaired in right ventricular infarction due to frequent ischemic involvement of the conduction system. $ #(Choices A and D)#  Anaphylactic shock and @septic shock@ are associated with peripheral vasodilation and massive fluid shift to the extravascular space.  The depleted intravascular volume lowers the mean circulatory filling pressure, reducing both RAP and PCWP, while hypotension caused by widespread peripheral vasodilation leads to a compensatory increase in cardiac output. $ (Choice B)  Gastrointestinal bleeding can cause @hypovolemic shock@ with decreased RAP, PCWP, and cardiac output.  Decreased cardiac output triggers an increase in sympathetic tone with peripheral vasoconstriction (increased systemic vascular resistance) to help maintain perfusion pressure. $ (Choice E)  Aortic stenosis causes left ventricular outflow obstruction and would increase pressure in the left atrium (increased PCWP) and pulmonary circulation.  In severe cases, right-sided heart failure can also develop, leading to increased RAP.  Systemic vascular resistance is increased with aortic stenosis in response to a reduction in cardiac output. $ Educational objective Right ventricular infarction (right-sided heart failure) can lead to shock via impaired forward blood flow to the left heart, which lowers left-sided preload (decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure) and decreases cardiac output.

These deposits then become colonized by microorganisms (eg, viridans streptococci) during episodes of bacteremia (eg, following dental extraction). $ In #developing countries#, the most common acquired heart disease leading to IE development is #rheumatic heart disease# (RHD).  RHD is a late (10-20 years) complication of acute rheumatic fever (eg, migratory arthritis, carditis/valvulitis, erythema marginatum).  RHD was historically considered a frequent predisposing factor for IE; however, MVP, valvular sclerosis, and mechanical valves are now more common causes in developed nations due to the recognition and treatment of group A streptococcal pharyngitis. $ (Choice A)  Congenital heart lesions that predispose to increased risk of IE include bicuspid aortic valve, ventricular septal defects, patent ductus arteriosus, and unrepaired tetralogy of Fallot.  Isolated atrial septal defects are not commonly associated with an increased risk of IE, likely due to the low-pressure differential between the atria and the absence of high-velocity intracardiac flow jets that can damage the endocardium. $ (Choice B)  Coronary heart disease can cause ischemic papillary muscle dysfunction with resultant mitral regurgitation.  However, the clinical presentation and autopsy findings in this patient are most consistent with MVP and IE. $ (Choice C)  IE is a rare complication of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and is almost always seen in patients with outflow obstruction.  @Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy@ is characterized by asymmetric ventricular hypertrophy leading to reduced left ventricular cavity size. $ (Choice D)  Mitral annular calcification refers to degeneration and progressive calcium deposition involving the fibrous annulus of the mitral valve.  Mitral annular calcification is usually seen in older adults (age >60), and the annulus is not a common location for IE. $ Educational objective Mitral valve prolapse with regurgitation is the most common predisposing condition for native valve infective endocarditis (IE) in developed nations.  Rheumatic heart disease remains a frequent cause of IE in developing nations.",

A primary insult to the myocardium leads to impaired myocardial contractile function with dilation of one or both ventricles.  The structural changes to the ventricular myocardium places these patients at risk of #sudden cardiac death# from ventricular arrhythmia (ie, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation).  In addition, the global hypokinesis of the left ventricle leads to stagnation of blood flow and the possible development of LV mural thrombus and subsequent systemic embolization. $ Causes of DCM include infection (eg, viral myocarditis, Chagas disease), chemical toxicity (eg, alcohol), and inherited disease.  The premature death of this patient's father from a heart problem suggests #familial DCM#, which is typically transmitted in an #autosomal dominant# inheritance pattern.  Truncating mutations affecting the #TTN gene#, which encodes for the cardiac @sarcomere protein@ #titin#, are the most common cause of familial DCM. $ (Choice A)  Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is an autoimmune disorder characterized by venous and/or arterial thrombosis.  Cardiac manifestations can include valvular thickening, nonbacterial vegetations, and increased risk of coronary atherosclerosis; however, LV cavity enlargement and mural thrombus are not typical. $ (Choice C)  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by mutation in genes encoding for one of several cardiac sarcomere proteins (eg, beta-myosin heavy chain, myosin-binding protein C).  It is a common cause of sudden cardiac death in young individuals, usually during exertion.  Autopsy typically shows asymmetric septal hypertrophy of the left ventricle. $ (Choice D)  Ischemic heart disease can lead to myocardial dysfunction and LV enlargement that mimics DCM; however, this patient's coronary arteries had only minor atherosclerotic narrowing (ie, 20% and 25%) that would not have caused clinically significant myocardial ischemia. $ (Choice E)  Restrictive cardiomyopathy is typically the early cardiac manifestation of an infiltrative process (eg, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis) and is characterized by nondilated ventricles with enlargement of both atria. $ Educational objective Dilated cardiomyopathy results from primary myocardial dysfunction leading to eccentric remodeling of the left ventricle.

Hypertensive emergencies typically occur in patients with preexisting essential hypertension and may be induced by medication noncompliance, which can result in a rapid increase in systemic blood pressure.  Severe hypertension can cause damage to the vascular endothelium, leading to increased vascular permeability to coagulation factors (eg, fibrinogen), platelet activation, and endothelial cell death.  In the kidney, this manifests as #malignant nephrosclerosis#, which is characterized by 2 distinct histopathologic patterns: $ • #Fibrinoid necrosis:#  Cell death and excessive fibrin deposition within the arteriolar walls is visible as circumferential, amorphous, pink material with smudged, necrotic endothelial cells that lack cytologic detail. $ •  #Hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis:#  Over time, activated platelets and injured endothelial cells release growth factors, which induce concentric hyperplasia and layering of smooth muscle cells and collagen, resulting in intimal thickening and an '@onion-skin@' appearance. $ These changes result in narrowing and/or obliteration of the arteriolar lumen; the resultant erythrocyte fragmentation and platelet consumption can cause a #microangiopathic hemolytic anemia# that is histologically indistinguishable from hemolytic uremic syndrome.

These changes may be seen in chronic hypertension; however, the severely elevated blood pressure and evidence of end-organ dysfunction in this patient are indicative of acute hypertensive emergency and malignant nephrosclerosis. $ (Choice C)  Granulomatous inflammation of the media characterizes @temporal (giant cell) arteritis@, the most common form of systemic vasculitis in adults. $ Educational objective Hypertensive emergency is severely elevated blood pressure (typically >180/120 mm Hg) with evidence of end-organ damage.

The endothelium lining the aortic side of the aortic valve cusps is exposed to the same high pressure and turbulent blood flow as the aortic vascular endothelium.  As occurs with @atheroma development@ in the vascular endothelium, these mechanical forces (along with smoking, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia) over time cause damage to the #aortic valve cusp endothelium#, triggering #endothelial dysfunction# and the onset of a similar atherosclerotic process.  There is subendothelial lipid deposition and infiltration of inflammatory cells (ie, macrophages, T lymphocytes) followed by the release of inflammatory mediators (eg, interleukin-1-beta, transforming growth factor beta-1). $ Subsequently, there is increased production of proteins involved in tissue calcification (eg, osteopontin).

The likelihood of plaque rupture is typically related to plaque stability rather than plaque size or degree of luminal narrowing.  Plaque stability largely depends on the mechanical strength of the fibrous cap:  Thin-cap fibroatheromas are generally unstable and more vulnerable to rupture. $ During the chronic inflammatory progression of an atheroma, the fibrous cap is continually being remodeled.  The balance of collagen synthesis and degradation determines the mechanical strength of the cap.  #Thin-cap fibroatheromas# are characterized by a large necrotic core covered by a thin fibrous cap.  Activated macrophages infiltrating the atheroma contribute to the breakdown of extracellular matrix proteins (eg, collagen) by secreting #metalloproteinases#.  Ongoing intimal inflammation can destabilize the mechanical integrity of the plaque through release of these metalloproteinases, resulting in plaque rupture and consequent acute coronary syndrome. $ (Choice A)  Hydroxymethylglutaryl (HMG) CoA reductase is the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis and is mostly expressed in the liver, intestine, adrenal cortex, and reproductive tissues.  Patients with hyperlipidemia are typically treated with statins (eg, atorvastatin), which competitively inhibit HMG CoA reductase. $ (Choice B)  Lysyl oxidase strengthens extracellular collagen fibers by mediating cross-link formation between lysine and hydroxylysine residues (requires copper).  Therefore, a high activity of lysyl oxidase would favor atheroma stabilization by strengthening collagen in the fibrous cap. $ (Choice D)  Procollagen peptidase cleaves the terminal regions of procollagen molecules exocytosed by fibroblasts or smooth muscle cells, transforming procollagen into insoluble tropocollagen.  Tropocollagen then aggregates to form collagen fibrils. $ (Choice E)  Prolyl hydroxylase is responsible for the hydroxylation of proline on procollagen chains (requires vitamin C), which is a necessary step in the formation of a stable collagen triple helix. $ Educational objective The likelihood of plaque rupture is related to plaque stability rather than plaque size or the degree of luminal narrowing.  Plaque stability largely depends on the mechanical strength of the fibrous cap.

Dissections can affect the ascending aorta (@type A@) or may involve only the descending aorta (type B).  The most common symptom is sharp or tearing #chest and back pain# that is severe and sudden.  If an ascending dissection extends proximally to the aortic root, it can affect the coronary ostia or aortic valve, resulting in myocardial ischemia or aortic regurgitation, respectively.  Other signs and symptoms include #blood pressure asymmetry#, stroke, or paraplegia, depending on the @vessels and structures@ involved (eg, subclavian artery, carotid artery, spinal arteries). $ In addition, a dissection may extend proximally into the #pericardium#, causing blood to fill the pericardial space and leading to acute tamponade.  As blood accumulates, the rising pericardial pressure can rapidly exceed right-sided filling pressures and restrict venous return, resulting in a precipitous drop in cardiac output and #obstructive shock# that can lead to cardiac arrest.  Signs of tamponade include jugular venous distension, muffled heart sounds, and hypotension (Beck triad), as well as reduced point of maximal impulse, cool extremities, and clear lungs. $ (Choice A)  Air in the pleural space is expected with tension pneumothorax, which can cause obstructive shock due to mediastinal shifting with vena cava collapse and impaired venous return to the heart.  Although sudden-onset chest pain is common, shortness of breath and unilaterally absent breath sounds are expected. $ (Choice C)  A ruptured posteromedial papillary muscle causes acute mitral regurgitation, which can abruptly lead to cardiogenic shock.  Patients are expected to have shortness of breath and lung crackles due to acute pulmonary edema. $ (Choice D)  A saddle pulmonary thromboembolism can cause obstructive shock with right ventricular failure and jugular venous distension.  However, it would not account for upper extremity blood pressure asymmetry or an unpalpable point of maximal impulse. $ (Choice E)  Transmural necrosis of the anterolateral myocardium can cause left ventricular free wall rupture with patients developing acute tamponade as blood rapidly fills the pericardium.  This etiology of tamponade would not explain upper extremity blood pressure asymmetry. $ Educational objective Acute aortic dissection typically presents with sudden-onset, severe chest pain that is sharp or tearing in nature.  Upper extremity blood pressure asymmetry can result from extension of the dissection into the subclavian artery, and additional complications (eg, stroke, myocardial ischemia) can result from extension into other vessels.

Although most cases are associated with normal ventricular wall thickness, infiltrative conditions such as cardiac amyloidosis may lead to significant #ventricular hypertrophy#.  Infiltrative diseases can also cause conduction system abnormalities (eg, bradycardia) that may ultimately require pacemaker implantation. $ #Cardiac amyloidosis# results from abnormal extracellular deposition of insoluble proteins such as monoclonal light chains (AL amyloidosis), mutated transthyretin (familial ATTR amyloidosis), or wild-type transthyretin (senile systemic amyloidosis) in myocardial tissue.

Left atrial myxomas can obstruct blood flow across the mitral valve, resulting in syncope and symptoms of heart failure.  Endomyocardial biopsy typically reveals numerous bland stellate cells in a background of myxoid ground substance. $ (Choice B)  Cardiac @sarcoidosis@ can present with restrictive or dilated cardiomyopathy along with conduction defects and atrial or ventricular arrhythmias; sudden death can also occur.  Microscopic examination of the myocardium reveals the presence of noncaseating granulomas containing giant cells. $ (Choice C)  @Chagas disease@ occurs secondary to Trypanosoma cruzi infection and is a common cause of myopericarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy in Latin America.  Microscopic examination typically shows multiple parasitic protozoa within the myocardial fibers with a dense cellular infiltrate and myofiber destruction. $ (Choice D)  @Hemochromatosis@ leads to excessive iron deposition in the myocardium and can cause conduction abnormalities and restrictive or dilated cardiomyopathy.  Endomyocardial biopsy typically reveals excessive iron deposition in the myocardium, which can be confirmed with Prussian blue staining. $ Educational objective Restrictive cardiomyopathy can be caused by infiltrative diseases (eg, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis) and often results in diastolic heart failure due to ventricular hypertrophy with impaired ventricular filling.

This patient's Lichtenberg figures (erythematous cutaneous marks in a fern-leaf pattern) and second-degree burns confirm the suspicion.  Although lightning injuries are rare, they are associated with a 25% fatality rate, and more than 70% of survivors have long-lasting complications.  Two-thirds of lightning-related deaths occur within the first hour following injury; the most common causes are fatal arrhythmias and respiratory failure.  A comprehensive and thorough physical examination should always be performed on lightning strike victims as injury patterns are widely variable and skin findings can significantly underestimate the extent of internal injury. $ (Choice B)  Superficial burns are common in lightning injury.  In contrast, deep-tissue burns are relatively rare due to the short duration of electrical contact and the 'flashover effect,' the tendency of lightning to travel over the skin surface and discharge to the ground.  This effect is responsible for the formation of Lichtenberg figures. $ (Choice C)  Intracranial hemorrhage only rarely occurs following lightning injury.  Lightning strikes can damage the autonomic system and cause fixed and dilated or asymmetric pupils.  These signs may not accurately reflect the extent of neurologic injury and should not be a reason to stop resuscitation. $ #(Choices D and E)#  Lightning induces rapid heating of the surrounding air, generating shock waves that can travel through the body and cause mechanical trauma.  As a result, patients should be thoroughly assessed for skeletal fractures.  Myocardial contusion and pulmonary barotrauma occur less frequently and would be extremely rare causes of death. $ Educational objective Although lightning injuries are rare, they are associated with a 25% fatality rate.

Carcinoids are well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors found most commonly in the distal small intestine and proximal colon, with a strong propensity for metastasis to the liver.  These tumors secrete several products (including histamine, serotonin, and vasoactive intestinal peptide) that are metabolized in the liver.  In patients with liver metastasis, these hormones are released directly into the systemic circulation, leading to carcinoid syndrome. $ Carcinoid heart disease is caused by excessive secretion of #serotonin#, which stimulates fibroblast growth and fibrogenesis.

This septum is composed of muscular and membranous portions; failed fusion of any of its derivative parts results in @VSD@.  The associated murmur #may not be audible immediately# after birth due to high pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) that limits left-to-right shunting through the VSD; it typically develops over the ensuing days as PVR declines (as in this case). $ • #Small VSDs# are typically asymptomatic due to the small volume of shunted blood, but turbulent flow through this narrow connection causes a #harsh, holosystolic murmur# at the left-mid to left-lower sternal border.  Unlike larger defects, small VSDs usually undergo spontaneous closure. $ • #Moderate to large VSDs# lead to pulmonary overcirculation and @left-sided volume overload@ that can cause #heart failure# (eg, diaphoresis, failure to thrive); larger shunts increase the risk.  Because of relatively unrestricted flow compared to smaller defects, auscultation typically demonstrates a softer or no murmur.

The characteristic systolic ejection murmur best heard over the second intercostal space is caused by right-sided volume overload and increased flow across the pulmonic valve. $ (Choice C)  Patent ductus arteriosus (@PDA@) occurs due to failed obliteration of the vascular connection between the pulmonary artery and aorta and allows left-to-right shunting.  Like VSD, a PDA murmur typically increases in intensity as PVR declines following birth; the continuous murmur is best heard at the left upper sternal border. $ (Choice E)  Malalignment of the infundibular septum can cause varying degrees of right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) obstruction, as in @tetralogy of Fallot@.  Patients typically have a large VSD and a murmur created by flow through the partially obstructed RVOT (crescendo-decrescendo murmur best heard along the left mid to upper sternal border). $ Educational objective Ventricular septal defect occurs due to insufficient development of the interventricular septum and commonly presents with a holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border as pulmonary vascular resistance declines in the neonatal period.

The exacerbation with swallowing indicates that the posterior pericardium may be involved, and the radiation into the neck suggests involvement of the inferior pericardium, which is adjacent to phrenic nerve afferents supplying the diaphragm.

Fibrous thickening and fusion of the valve leaflets in chronic rheumatic heart disease following acute #rheumatic fever# is the most common cause of MS, accounting for up to 99% of cases.  There is often a latency period of 10-20 years between the initial episode of rheumatic fever and symptomatic MS, with most patients manifesting during the fourth or fifth decade of life. $ Mitral stenosis can cause atrial enlargement, which may lead to #atrial fibrillation# and/or atrial #mural thromboses#.  Thrombi dislodged from the wall of the left atrium may later cause an embolic stroke, which likely occurred in this patient.  Cardiac auscultation in #mitral stenosis# often reveals a loud first heart sound (S1), an early diastolic sound (opening snap), followed by a #mid-diastolic murmur# from turbulent flow across the mitral valve. $ (Choice A)  Congenital endocardial cushion defects can result in mitral regurgitation.  However, congenital mitral valve stenosis is rare and untreated newborns and infants typically have a grim prognosis. $ (Choice B)  Degenerative calcific deposits most commonly develop in the mitral valve annulus in women over age 60 and generally do not impair valve function.  This patient's autopsy did not show any peripherally located nodular calcific deposits. $ (Choice C)  Embolization of vegetations due to infective endocarditis can cause a stroke or septic infarct resulting in a brain abscess.  However, infective endocarditis is usually associated with large friable vegetations on the valve cusps along with destruction (rather than fibrosis) of the valve leaflets. $ (Choice D)  Tertiary syphilis may result in aortitis, aortic aneurysm, and/or aortic regurgitation.  Mitral valve lesions are not commonly observed. $ (Choice F)  Although cardiac involvement is uncommon in rheumatoid arthritis, patients can develop pericarditis and myocarditis.  Rheumatoid nodules can also develop in the cardiac tissues (including valvular structures), but these are rarely symptomatic. $ (Choice G)  Rupture of papillary muscle (whether due to bacterial endocarditis, a connective tissue disease, or myocardial infarction) leads to prolapse of the valve leaflets and mitral regurgitation (holosystolic or early systolic murmur). $ Educational objective Rheumatic mitral stenosis is characterized by diffuse fibrous thickening and distortion of the mitral valve leaflets along with commissural fusion at the leaflet edges.  Patients often present with a diastolic murmur, dyspnea, and fatigue and are at increased risk of atrial fibrillation and thromboembolism (eg, stroke)."

Pericarditis typically presents with substernal #pleuritic chest pain# that may radiate to the bilateral scapulae posteriorly.  The pain is typically worse when lying flat and improves with sitting up and leaning forward.

Despite a family history of CAD, myocardial infarction is relatively unlikely in this man age <40. $ (Choice C)  Gram-positive cocci (eg, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae) in rare cases can cause pericarditis (purulent pericarditis) via direct extension of pneumonia or hematogenous bacterial spread.  Affected patients are typically quite ill and present with high fever and sepsis. $ (Choice D)  Malignant pericarditis can occur in the setting of metastatic cancer (eg, lung cancer, breast cancer); however, it is less likely to present with pain and inflammation and more likely to present with symptoms of fluid accumulation (ie, dyspnea due to subacute cardiac tamponade).  Malignant pericarditis is also relatively uncommon compared to viral pericarditis and less likely in this relatively young man. $ Educational objective Viral infection is the most common cause of acute pericarditis.

Inflammatory cells (particularly macrophages) release matrix metalloproteinases and elastases that degrade extracellular matrix components (eg, elastin, collagen), leading to weakening and #progressive expansion# of the aortic wall.

However, thiazides, especially in higher doses, can cause a variety of metabolic complications, including hypercalcemia, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hyponatremia, and hypokalemia.  The incidence of the individual side effects is relatively low, and, patients rarely experience all of the potential adverse effects. $ Thiazides increase renal Ca2+ reabsorption, leading to #hypercalcemia# and #hypocalciuria#.  This occurs through 2 major mechanisms: $ 1. Thiazides #inhibit the Na+/Cl− cotransporter# on the apical side of distal convoluted tubule cells, which decreases intracellular Na+ concentration.  This activates the basolateral #Na+/Ca2+ antiporter#, which pumps Na+ into the cell in exchange for Ca2+.  The resulting decrease in intracellular Ca2+ enhances luminal Ca2+ reabsorption across the apical membrane. $ 2. #Hypovolemia# induced by thiazides increases Na+ and H2O reabsorption in the proximal tubule, leading to a passive increase in paracellular Ca2+ reabsorption. $ The increase in circulating calcium suppresses parathyroid hormone (PTH) release, leading to a new steady state with a mildly elevated serum calcium concentration and low serum PTH. $ (Choice A)  Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is a benign disorder caused by mutations in the calcium-sensing receptor in the parathyroid gland and kidneys.  Higher calcium levels are required to suppress secretion of PTH, leading to mild hypercalcemia and hypocalciuria.  However, unlike in patients taking thiazide diuretics, PTH is high-normal or mildly elevated. $ (Choice B)  Hyperthyroidism can cause hypercalcemia due to increased osteoclastic bone resorption, but serum calcium in hypothyroidism is usually normal. $ #(Choices D and E)# Primary hyperparathyroidism is caused by parathyroid hyperplasia or adenoma; it is characterized by hypercalcemia with elevated or inappropriately normal PTH levels.  Secondary hyperparathyroidism is usually seen in patients with chronic kidney disease and is due to phosphate retention and decreased production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D; these disturbances lead to decreased intestinal calcium absorption, hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and a compensatory increase in PTH secretion.  This patient has a decreased PTH level. $Educational objective Thiazide diuretics cause hypercalcemia by increasing the distal tubular reabsorption of Ca2+.  The increased circulating calcium levels result in suppression of parathyroid hormone, which distinguishes this effect from hyperparathyroidism."

    "explanation_2": "$The presence of a #midsystolic click# followed by a systolic murmur at the cardiac apex that disappears with squatting is most consistent with @mitral valve prolapse@ (MVP).  The click is caused by sudden tensing of the chordae tendineae as they are pulled taut by the ballooning valve leaflets, and the murmur results from regurgitation of blood due to malalignment of the valve margins with prolapse. $ During systole, there is a critical left ventricular (LV) size at which prolapse occurs; therefore, @maneuvers@ that change LV end-diastolic volume affect the timing of the click and murmur. #Squatting increases venous return# and #LV volume#, increasing the tension and #decreasing the slack# in the mitral valve apparatus.  Because the ventricular walls have farther to travel to reach the critical LV size at which prolapse occurs, #prolapse occurs later# in systole or not at all. $ Primary MVP is most commonly a sporadic disorder and is characterized by myxomatous degeneration (ie, pathologic #deterioration of the connective tissue#) affecting the mitral valve leaflets and chordae tendineae.  Secondary MVP is associated with inherited connective tissue disorders, including Marfan or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and osteogenesis imperfecta. $ (Choice A)  @Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy@ (HCM) presents with a systolic murmur at the left sternal border that decreases in intensity with squatting (due to increased LV volume and decreased outflow tract obstruction).  A midsystolic click is not heard with HCM. $ (Choice C)  Coronary artery disease can cause myocardial ischemia or infarction leading to papillary muscle dysfunction and acute mitral regurgitation.

Pericarditis may produce a friction rub; however, it is not associated with a cardiac murmur. $ Educational objective Mitral valve prolapse is most often caused by defects in connective tissue proteins that predispose to myxomatous degeneration of the mitral leaflets and chordae tendineae.

In this patient, the #slow development# of a #stable atherosclerotic plaque# in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) likely allowed collateral vessels from the right coronary artery to supply the ischemic myocardium located distal to the LAD occlusion.  Because there is low hydrostatic pressure distal to the LAD occlusion, a pressure gradient is created that facilitates blood flow through the small collateral vessels. $  An @unstable atherosclerotic plaque@ is less likely to allow the development of viable collateral vessels, as it is more likely to rupture before it becomes large enough to cause significant chronic ischemia; rupture leads to overlying thrombus and #abrupt arterial occlusion# with acute myocardial ischemia/#infarction# and cellular necrosis.  The rapid development of ischemia allows insufficient time for collateral vessels to develop and mature. $ #(Choices A, B, and F)# Atherosclerotic plaques with active inflammation (containing activated macrophages that secrete metalloproteinases and degrade collagen), high core concentration of lipids, and/or a thin fibrous cap are unstable and more likely to rupture.  All of these properties are less likely in an atherosclerotic lesion that has grown to create near-total occlusion without rupturing. $ (Choice C)  A patient's total coronary artery calcium content correlates with the total atherosclerotic plaque burden, and calcium scoring by cardiac CT scan is sometimes used to estimate the severity of coronary artery disease.  However, low calcium content (or immature calcification) within an individual plaque may decrease stability of that plaque and increase the likelihood of rupture. $ (Choice D)  Ostial atherosclerotic plaques (those located at a branch point of 2 arteries) are more likely to occlude blood flow to multiple areas of myocardium, thereby limiting the availability of nearby well-perfused arteries from which viable collateral vessels can develop. $ Educational objective Gradually developing myocardial ischemia encourages the formation and maturation of collateral vessels and is most likely to occur in the setting of a slow-growing, stable atherosclerotic plaque.  An unstable atherosclerotic plaque (eg, that with active inflammation, a lipid-rich core, and/or a thin fibrous cap) is more likely to rupture, resulting in the abrupt onset of ischemia/infarction that precludes the development of viable collateral vessels.",

Up to 30% of cases may present with no apparent risk factors (eg, hypercoagulability). $ Massive PE can lead to hypotension and @obstructive shock@.  There is a rapid increase in pulmonary arterial resistance that leads to an increase in pulmonary arterial and right ventricular (RV) pressure.

Chagas disease is caused by infection with the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, which is transmitted by the triatomine 'kissing' bug (Reduviid family) found throughout the Americas as far north as the southern United States.  Infection is rare in developed regions, but the disease is endemic throughout #Central and South America# where widespread open-air and thatched-roof housing exposes individuals to routine contact with the triatomine vector. $ Years following initial infection, some individuals develop serious end-organ damage affecting the cardiac, gastrointestinal, and/or central nervous systems.  Cardiac disease results from a chronic parasite-induced and immune-mediated @myocarditis@ that leads to #dilated cardiomyopathy# (DCM).  Chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy is relatively unique among DCMs in that there is characteristically localized #apical wall thinning# with the development of a large apical #aneurysm#.  In addition to impairing ventricular systolic function, the aneurysm can harbor #mural thrombus# that may systemically embolize and cause stroke.  Damage to the cardiac conduction system can also trigger #ventricular arrhythmias# (eg, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation) that can lead to sudden cardiac death (the likely cause of death in this patient). $ The gastrointestinal manifestations of Chagas disease result from destruction of the myenteric plexus, which can lead to progressive dilation and dysfunction of the esophagus and, less commonly, the colon. $ #(Choices A, C, D, and E)#  Excessive alcohol consumption can lead to DCM.  Measles, mumps, and rubella are typically vaccinated against in childhood and are potential causes of viral DCM.  Genetic mutations of the gene encoding for the cardiac sarcomere protein titin can lead to familial DCM.  Miners and metal workers who are exposed to high levels of cobalt can develop DCM.  These DCMs typically involve diffuse left ventricular wall thinning, unlike the characteristic localized apical wall thinning and aneurysm development that occurs in chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy.  DCM due to ischemic heart disease may sometimes involve localized wall thinning with aneurysm development, but it is unlikely in this young man with no evidence of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease.  Esophageal enlargement is also not expected with these other etiologies of DCM. $ Educational objective Chagas disease is endemic to Central and South America and can lead to chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy, a dilated cardiomyopathy.

The lack of collaterals between segmental renal arteries (\"#end-organ#\" blood supply) means that any interruption of blood flow can lead to coagulative infarcts.  Common laboratory findings include elevated lactate dehydrogenase (reflecting cell necrosis), mild leukocytosis, and hematuria.  Serum creatinine is usually normal due to compensation by the unaffected kidney.  Macroscopically, renal infarcts appear as pale #wedges#, with the base (widest part) at the renal cortex and the apex pointing to the medulla. $ The most common cause of renal infarction is #systemic thromboembolism# from the left atrium or ventricle.  Thromboembolism is a common complication of #atrial fibrillation# because the irregular contractions lead to sluggish, uneven flow in the left atrium and facilitate clot formation.  Emboli from atrial fibrillation, which can be paroxysmal (thereby going undiagnosed), may have also caused this patient's recent stroke.  The #brain and kidneys# are more likely than other organs to suffer embolic infarctions because they are perfused at a higher rate. $ (Choice B)  Lower extremity venous thromboembolism can lead to pulmonary embolism because returning blood passes through the right heart and subsequently to the lungs.

      "explanation_2": "The appearance of vacuoles and phospholipid-containing amorphous densities within mitochondria generally signifies irreversible injury, and implies a permanent inability to generate further ATP via oxidative phosphorylation.  When the mitochondria are injured irreversibly, the cell cannot recover.  Simple mitochondrial swelling may be associated with reversible cellular injury, however. $ (Choice A)  Myofibril relaxation is an early sign of reversible injury in cardiac myocytes, which occurs within the first 30 minutes of severe ischemia.  Myofibril relaxation corresponds with intracellular ATP depletion and lactate accumulation due to anaerobic glycolysis during this period. $ (Choice B)  Disaggregation of polysomes denotes the dissociation of rRNA from mRNA in reversible ischemic/hypoxic injury.  Depletion of intracellular ATP is thought to promote the dissolution of polysomes into monosomes as well as the detachment of ribosomes from the rough endoplasmic reticulum.  Disaggregation of polysomes results in impaired protein synthesis. $ (Choice D)  Disaggregation of granular and fibrillar elements of the nucleus is associated with reversible cell injury.  Another common nuclear change associated with reversible cell injury is clumping of nuclear chromatin, perhaps secondary to a decrease in intracellular pH. $ (Choice E)  Triglyceride droplet accumulation is characteristic of reversible cell injury, especially in hepatocytes, and also in striated muscle cells and renal cells.  This fatty change may result from the decreased synthesis of intracellular proteins that occurs with cell injury.  In the hepatocyte, decreased production of lipid acceptor proteins prevents the normal incorporation of triglycerides into lipoproteins.  Since triglycerides cannot be rapidly exported from the cell in the form of lipoproteins, they accumulate intracellularly. $ (Choice F)  Glycogen loss is another early and reversible cellular response to injury.  As a result of lowered mitochondrial ATP production, ATP must be supplied to the cell via anaerobic glycolysis of glucose derived from the cell's glycogen stores.  Myocardial glycogen stores may be completely depleted within 30 minutes of the onset of severe ischemia. $ Educational Objective Mitochondrial vacuolization is typically a sign of irreversible cell injury, signifying that the involved mitochondria are permanently unable to generate ATP."

In the evolution of STEMI on ECG, peaked T waves in the affected leads are typically the first manifestation, followed by the appearance of ST elevation within several minutes, then Q waves within hours to days.  Patients with STEMI typically have sudden-onset substernal chest pain that may be accompanied by nausea, diaphoresis, or dyspnea; the pain does not improve with rest or the administration of short-acting nitrates (eg, nitroglycerin). $Myocardial infarction is usually caused by acute #atherosclerotic plaque rupture# with release of lipids, collagen, and tissue factor into the blood stream; because these contents are highly thrombogenic, there is rapid formation of #overlying thrombus#.  In STEMI, the overlying thrombus is extensive enough to fully occlude the coronary artery lumen, completely blocking blood flow to a portion of the heart and leading to transmural (full-thickness) infarction of the myocardial wall.  Partially obstructive thrombus #(choice E)# is likely to produce non-STEMI or unstable angina.  Non-STEMI is associated with impaired blood flow to only the subendocardial region; the symptomatic presentation is similar to STEMI, but ECG reveals ST segment and T wave abnormalities with no ST elevation. $ (Choice A)  Atherosclerotic plaque obstructing 50% of the coronary artery lumen is likely to be asymptomatic.  Symptoms of stable angina do not typically become prominent until >70% of the cross-sectional area of the coronary artery lumen is occluded. $ (Choice B)  Atherosclerotic plaque obstructing 80% of the coronary artery lumen is likely to cause stable angina, characterized by substernal or left-sided chest pressure, tightness, or pain that is precipitated by exertion and relieved by rest or short-acting nitrates. $ (Choice D)  Coronary artery vasospasm (vasospastic or Prinzmetal angina) results from hyperactivity of intimal smooth muscle, usually in the absence of significant atherosclerotic coronary artery disease.  Transient anginal chest pain with corresponding ST elevation on ECG can occur; however, the chest pain should rapidly resolve with nitroglycerin. $ Educational objective ST-elevation myocardial infarction involves transmural (full-thickness) infarction of the myocardial wall, and usually results from acute atherosclerotic plaque rupture with the development of overlying thrombus that fully occludes the coronary artery lumen.

      "explanation_2": "$This patient likely has #pulmonic valve stenosis# (PS), which most commonly occurs as an isolated #congenital defect# and rarely occurs as an acquired defect (eg, rheumatic fever, carcinoid syndrome).  Severe PS is typically diagnosed early in life due to development of right-sided heart failure, but patients with relatively mild PS often do not present with symptoms (eg, dyspnea, fatigue) until adulthood.  The physiologic changes of pregnancy (eg, increased plasma volume) can unmask underlying PS. $ Cardiac auscultation in PS reveals a pulmonic #ejection click# followed by a harsh #crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur# best heard at the @left upper sternal border@.  The stenosis causes the pulmonic valve to close later than usual as it takes longer for the right ventricle to push blood through the narrowed valve.  This results in #widened splitting# of the aortic and pulmonic components of S2.  Inspiration draws additional blood into the right side of heart, which increases the intensity of the murmur and further widens the splitting of S2. $ Pulmonary hypertension is another cause of widened splitting of S2 because more time is required for the right ventricle to overcome pulmonary arterial pressure (ie, the pulmonic valve opens later and closes later). $ (Choice A)  A benign flow murmur can occur in patients with high cardiac output states (eg, pregnancy) due to increased flow across the aortic and pulmonic valves; however, the murmur is typically low grade (2/6 or less) and abnormal splitting of S2 is not present. $ (Choice B)  A bicuspid aortic valve is the most common congenital heart defect seen in adults and can lead to aortic stenosis in relatively young patients (eg, those in their 50s).  However, aortic stenosis causes delayed closure of the aortic valve, leading to narrowed or paradoxical splitting of S2. $ (Choice C)  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can cause a @systolic murmur@ that mimics that of aortic stenosis and is best heard at the mid-left sternal border.  Aortic valve closure may be delayed due to prolonged ejection of blood through the left ventricular outflow tract. $ (Choice E)  A small- or moderate-sized ventricular septal defect may present in adulthood with symptoms of heart failure.  There is typically widened splitting of S2 due to early closure of the aortic valve (less blood is ejected into the aorta because some blood is ejected into the right ventricle).  However, a holosystolic murmur best heard at the left lower sternal border is expected. $ Educational objective Pulmonic valve stenosis causes a crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur (best heard at the left upper sternal border) and delays closure of the pulmonic valve, resulting in widened splitting of S2.  Inspiration increases blood flow to the right side of the heart, causing increased intensity of the murmur and even later closure of the pulmonic valve.",

      "explanation_2": "#Myocardial hibernation# refers to a state of #chronic myocardial ischemia# in which both myocardial metabolism and function are reduced to match a concomitant reduction in coronary blood flow (due to moderate/severe flow-limiting stenosis).  This new equilibrium prevents myocardial necrosis.  Chronically hibernating myocardium demonstrates decreased expression and disorganization of contractile and cytoskeletal proteins, altered adrenergic control, and reduced calcium responsiveness.  These changes lead to #decreased contractility# and left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction.  However, coronary revascularization and subsequent restoration of blood flow to hibernating myocardium improves contractility and LV function. $ (Choice B)  Ischemic preconditioning is a phenomenon in which brief repetitive episodes of myocardial ischemia, followed by reperfusion, protect the myocardium from subsequent prolonged episodes of ischemia.  In clinical terms, repetitive episodes of angina prior to myocardial infarction can delay cell death after complete coronary occlusion and therefore provide greater time for myocardial salvage with coronary revascularization. $ (Choice C)  Post-infarction myocardial scarring refers to the replacement of myocardium with collagen and fibrous tissue.  This leads to complete loss of myocardial contractile function, and cardiac contractility would not be expected to improve with coronary revascularization. $ (Choice D)  Reperfusion injury refers to further myocardial cell damage due to restoration of blood flow after a sudden ischemic event.  The clinical manifestations of reperfusion injury include arrhythmias, microvascular dysfunction with myocardial stunning, and myocyte injury and death. $ (Choice E)  Ventricular remodeling refers to a change in the structure (cardiac mass or dimensions) or function of the heart in response to cardiac injury or hemodynamic changes (pressure/volume overload).  Remodeling can occur with long-term myocardial hibernation, but it would take weeks to months (not days) to recover following reperfusion therapy. $ Educational objective Hibernating myocardium refers to the presence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction due to reduced coronary blood flow at rest that is partially or completely reversible by coronary revascularization."

In Marfan syndrome, the dissection almost always affects the ascending aorta; it can propagate proximally to impair aortic valve closure, causing acute aortic regurgitation (evidenced by a decrescendo @diastolic murmur@) and heart failure (evidenced by pulmonary edema). $ Marfan syndrome results from a mutation that disrupts the synthesis, secretion, and incorporation into the extracellular matrix of #fibrillin#, a protein that provides the glycoprotein scaffolding for elastin structure.

Myxomatous degeneration does not play a significant role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. $ (Choice C)  The pathogenesis of berry aneurysms is multifactorial.  Contributory factors include hemodynamic stress, hypertension, and certain connective tissue disorders.  Type IV Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (which results in abnormalities in type III collagen) predisposes patients to the development of berry aneurysms.  Myxomatous degeneration is not associated with berry aneurysms. $ (Choice D)  A @false aneurysm@, or pseudoaneurysm, is the result of a breach in the continuity of all the layers of a blood vessel, leading to blood leakage outside the vessel wall (eg, hematoma).  The intima would not be intact in a false aneurysm. $ (Choice E)  Giant cell arteritis involves granulomatous inflammation of the media and fragmentation of the internal elastic lamina, perhaps due to autoimmunity to elastin.  It is not related to myxomatous changes of the arterial wall. $ (Choice F)  Hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis of the renal arterioles is associated with malignant hypertension.  It results from concentric lamellar reduplication of the intimal smooth muscle cells (\"onion-skinning\").  Myxomatous degeneration is not a contributing factor. $ Educational objective Myxomatous changes, with pooling of mucopolysaccharides in the media layer of large arteries, are found in cystic medial degeneration, which predisposes affected patients to the development of aortic aneurysms.  Medial degeneration in younger individuals is frequently due to Marfan syndrome.",

However, in constrictive pericarditis, the rigid pericardium prevents the right side of the heart from accommodating increased venous return, which leads to a #paradoxical rise in JVP during inspiration#, referred to as Kussmaul sign. $ (Choice B)  A loud pulmonic component of the second heart sound (P2) is heard in patients with pulmonary hypertension. $ (Choice C)  During inspiration, venous return to the right side of the heart is increased, resulting in later closure of the pulmonic valve and physiologic splitting of the aortic (A2) and pulmonic components of S2.  Paradoxical splitting occurs when cardiac pathology (eg, aortic stenosis, left bundle branch block) delays closure of the aortic valve, causing A2 to occur noticeably later than P2. $ (Choice D)  An S3 gallop occurs due to the sudden deceleration of blood as it enters a dilated ventricle; it is typically heard in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy or severe mitral regurgitation. $ (Choice E)  A sustained left parasternal lift is most commonly a sign of right ventricular hypertrophy, such as occurs with chronic right ventricular pressure overload (eg, pulmonary hypertension, pulmonic stenosis) or volume overload (eg, tricuspid regurgitation). $ Educational objective In constrictive pericarditis, normal pericardium is replaced by dense, rigid pericardial tissue that restricts ventricular filling, leading to low cardiac output and progressive right-sided heart failure.  Physical examination findings in such patients include elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), pericardial knock, pulsus paradoxus, and a paradoxical rise in JVP with inspiration (Kussmaul sign)."

This presentation is suggestive of #hereditary hemochromatosis# (HH), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by excessive intestinal iron absorption with #accumulation of the excess iron# in parenchymal tissues. $ Cardiac manifestations of HH include heart failure and conduction system disease.  In early stages, myocardial iron overload is expressed as #diastolic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction# with a restrictive filling pattern.  As the disease advances, progressive ventricular remodeling leads to #dilated cardiomyopathy# and reduced LV ejection fraction.  Iron deposition can also affect the cardiac conduction system. #Sinus node dysfunction# (ie, sick sinus syndrome) can lead to presyncope or syncope; malignant arrhythmias with sudden cardiac death occasionally occur. $ On light microscopy, cardiac hemochromatosis is visible as @brown, granular deposits (arrow)@ in myocytes that stain strongly with Prussian blue.  Cardiomyopathy can be the first presenting manifestation of HH, although careful assessment can usually find evidence of iron deposition elsewhere (eg, elevated hepatic transaminases, hepatomegaly).  Treatment includes therapeutic phlebotomy to remove excess iron stores, which can lead to regression of cardiomyopathy in some patients. $ (Choice A)  Amyloidosis is caused by extracellular deposition of misfolded amyloid proteins.  Multiorgan involvement (eg, cardiomyopathy, hepatomegaly) is common, but amyloidosis frequently involves the kidney (eg, nephrotic syndrome), nerves (eg, neuropathy), and muscles (eg, macroglossia).  It is not associated with hyperpigmentation. $ (Choice B)  Primary adrenal insufficiency (ie, cortisol deficiency) can cause hyperpigmentation due to cosecretion of melanocyte-stimulating hormone with ACTH (both derived from proopiomelanocortin).  However, hepatomegaly is not seen, and although hypotension is common, sinus node and diastolic dysfunction are not. $ (Choice C)  Sarcoidosis results from widespread formation of noncaseating granulomas.  Cardiac infiltration can cause conduction blockade, and liver involvement may result in hepatomegaly.  However, lung symptoms (eg, dyspnea, cough) are more common, and skin manifestations include papules and nodules rather than hyperpigmentation. $ (Choice D)  HH is associated with mutations in the HFE gene; the @HFE protein@ binds to the transferrin receptor and regulates intestinal and hepatic iron uptake.  Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mutations are associated with autoimmune disorders (eg, celiac disease, type 1 diabetes). $ (Choice F)  Glycogen storage disease type II (ie, Pompe disease) is caused by a deficiency in alpha-glucosidase (acid maltase).

Concentric hypertrophy is characterized by #uniform# thickening of the ventricular wall with the outer dimensions of the ventricle remaining almost unchanged, resulting in a narrowed ventricular cavity size.  It is due to chronic elevation of ventricular pressures during systole, which is usually caused by #long-standing hypertension# or aortic stenosis (#increased LV afterload#).  Patients may develop diastolic dysfunction with left atrial enlargement and congestive heart failure due to impaired ventricular compliance and filling. $ (Choice A)  An atrial septal defect causes a shunting of blood flow from the left to right atrium.  This typically results in volume overload of the right ventricle, producing right atrial enlargement and eccentric (dilated) right ventricular hypertrophy. $ (Choice C)  Mitral insufficiency causes LV volume overload as regurgitant flow through the mitral valve during systole increases the amount of blood returning to the LV during diastole.  The net structural consequence of mitral insufficiency is enlargement of the LV cavity and eccentric hypertrophy. $ (Choice D)  Mitral stenosis leads to left atrial enlargement due to elevated pressure in the left atrium.  The LV cavity is typically small/normal in size with normal wall thickness due to restriction of blood flow across the mitral valve. $ (Choice E)  Aging is associated with a decrease in LV chamber size, predominantly through shortening of the apex-to-base dimension accompanied by a leftward bowing of the lower interventricular (sigmoid) septum.  The aortic valve may also become calcified, resulting in aortic stenosis; however, structural cardiac changes due to aging are generally not prominent before age 65. $ (Choice F)  The ventricular remodeling that occurs after an acute myocardial infarction involves expansion, thinning, and fibrous healing of the infarcted zone of myocardium.  Regional dysfunction of the infarcted myocardium causes volume overload for the remaining viable myocardium.  The net result is usually eccentric hypertrophy, with enlargement of the LV cavity. $ (Choice G)  Patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome have an accessory pathway that bypasses the atrioventricular node and directly connects the atria and ventricles.  This results in ventricular preexcitation and the development of tachyarrhythmias.  The LV usually appears grossly normal. $ Educational objective Concentric hypertrophy is characterized by uniform thickening of the ventricular wall and narrowing of the ventricular cavity due to increased afterload (eg, chronic hypertension, aortic stenosis).  Eccentric hypertrophy is characterized by reduced ventricular wall thickness with an associated increase in chamber size due to volume overload."

These findings are consistent with #acute decompensated heart failure# (ADHF); chronic hypertension is a common cause of heart failure due to concentric left ventricular hypertrophy and resulting diastolic dysfunction. $ In ADHF, increased atrial and ventricular filling pressures are transmitted to the pulmonary vasculature, causing fluid transudation into pulmonary interstitial and alveolar spaces (#cardiogenic pulmonary edema#).  The chest x-ray may also show @Kerley B lines@—short, horizontal lines perpendicular to the pleural surface that represent edema of the interlobular septa. @Cardiomegaly@ (cardiac-to-thoracic width ratio >50%) is also common in heart failure, but it is difficult to assess on anteroposterior view due to magnification of the heart. $ (Choice B) @Acute respiratory distress syndrome@ (ARDS), or noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, results from endothelial injury and pulmonary capillary fluid leakage; it is typically preceded by a precipitating event such as sepsis, pneumonia, or trauma.  The appearance on chest x-ray is similar to ADHF, but pleural effusions are typically less prominent with ARDS (mostly alveolar opacification is seen), and ADHF is more likely given the absence of an inciting event in the patient's history. $ (Choice C)  The chest x-ray in @idiopathic interstitial fibrosis@ shows diffuse, reticular opacities typically associated with decreased lung volumes.  Most patients have slowly progressive dyspnea and a nonproductive cough. $ (Choice D)  Obstructive pulmonary diseases (eg, @chronic obstructive pulmonary disease@) are associated with hyperinflated lungs and a flattened diaphragm.

There are several genetic mutations described in patients with congenital LQTS.  The 2 most common forms (LQT type 1 and LQT type 2) are due to genetic #mutations in K+ channel# proteins that contribute to the outward-rectifying potassium current. $ Phase 3 (repolarization) of the @myocardial action potential@ occurs due to time-dependent inactivation of the L-type (long-lasting, large-conductance) Ca2+ channels (which reduces inward current) along with activation of the voltage-gated delayed rectifier K+ channels (which increases outward current).  This net increase in outward transmembrane current is responsible for ventricular repolarization.  #Decreased outward potassium# flow due to K+ channel mutations leads to prolongation of action potential duration and QT interval.  Prolongation of QT interval predisposes to the development of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias (eg, @torsades de pointes@), which can present as recurrent palpitations, #syncope#, #seizures#, or #sudden cardiac death#. $ (Choice A)  Abnormal anatomic communication between cardiac chambers presents in patients with atrial septal defects, ventricular septal defects, or patent ductus arteriosus.  These disorders are not associated with any genetic defects in ion channels. $ (Choice B)  Asymmetric hypertrophy of the left ventricle occurs in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in sarcomere genes.  The 2 most common mutations involve the cardiac myosin-binding protein C gene and cardiac beta-myosin heavy chain gene. $ (Choice C)  Ischemic myocardial necrosis and scarring occur in myocardial infarction and often lead to left ventricular systolic dysfunction.  Patients with scarred myocardium are also at increased risk for developing ventricular arrhythmias; however, these arrhythmias would not be associated with an ion channel defect. $ (Choice D)  Dilated cardiomyopathy is characterized by left ventricle dilation and systolic dysfunction.  Several genetic mutations involving the sarcomere structure and function have been identified in patients with familial dilated cardiomyopathy.  However, abnormal transmembrane K+ currents are not known to be directly involved in the pathophysiology. $ Educational objective Congenital long QT syndrome is most often caused by genetic mutations in a K+ channel protein that contributes to the outward-rectifying potassium current.  A decrease in the outward K+ current leads to prolongation of action potential duration and QT interval.  This prolongation predisposes to the development of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias (eg, torsades de pointes) that can cause palpitations, syncope, seizures, or sudden cardiac death.",

  "explanation_2": "The hemodynamic actions of #epinephrine# occur secondary to agonistic effects at α1, β1, and β2 adrenoreceptors (relative strength:  #β1 = β2 > α1#).  Stimulation of β1 receptors in the heart increases cardiac rate and contractility, which increases systolic blood pressure due to the rise in cardiac output.  Stimulation of β2 receptors in the skeletal muscle vasculature produces vasodilation and decreased diastolic blood pressure, while activation of α1 receptors on vascular smooth muscle in the skin and viscera increases peripheral resistance and raises diastolic blood pressure.  At #low doses#, β2-mediated #vasodilation predominates#, whereas at high doses α1-induced vasoconstriction becomes more pronounced. $In this experiment, low-dose epinephrine by itself caused #increased heart rate# (β1 response) and #decreased diastolic blood pressure# (β2 response).  However, after pretreatment with drug A, the heart rate fails to increase and there is a marked rise in diastolic blood pressure.  These effects are best explained by pretreatment with a #nonselective beta antagonist# such as propranolol.  When administered alone, propranolol produces peripheral vasoconstriction (β2 antagonism) without significantly increasing blood pressure (due to concomitant β1 blockade).  However, in combination with epinephrine, propranolol will counteract epinephrine's β2-mediated vasodilation and β1-mediated heart rate increase while leaving the α1 effect (vasoconstriction) intact.  This will increase diastolic blood pressure and cause a slight reflexive reduction in heart rate. $#(Choice A)#  Atropine is a competitive antagonist of cholinergic muscarinic receptors in the heart (M2).  Atropine increases the heart rate by blocking parasympathetic vagal influence; after pretreatment with atropine, epinephrine-mediated tachycardia would increase. $#(Choice B)#  Isoproterenol is a nonselective β-adrenergic agonist that stimulates both β2 receptors on vascular smooth muscle (leading to vasodilatation) and cardiac β1 receptors (leading to increases in cardiac rate and contractility).  A combination of isoproterenol and epinephrine would further decrease diastolic blood pressure and exacerbate the tachycardia. $#(Choice C)#  Phentolamine is a nonspecific alpha-1 and alpha-2 blocker with no beta-blocking effects that cause a profound fall in diastolic blood pressure and reflex tachycardia.  If this were drug A, blood pressure would have decreased further in the pretreatment group and the rise in heart rate would have been exacerbated. $#(Choice D)#  Phenylephrine is a selective α-adrenergic agonist.  Administration by itself may cause elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressures, which may be associated with reflex bradycardia.  However, after pretreatment, epinephrine would still produce an initial rise in heart rate due to unopposed β1 stimulation. $#Educational objective# Epinephrine increases systolic blood pressure (α1 + β1) and heart rate (β1), and either increases or decreases diastolic blood pressure depending on the dose (either α1 or β2 predominates).  Pretreatment with propranolol eliminates the β effects of epinephrine (vasodilatation and tachycardia), leaving only the α effect (vasoconstriction). "

The physician most likely added a #potassium-sparing diuretic# to this patient's treatment regimen to minimize potassium loss caused by loop diuretic use.  All diuretics except for the potassium-sparing class cause potassium loss by increasing sodium delivery to the #late distal tubule# and #cortical collecting duct#, where aldosterone-induced sodium reabsorption occurs at the expense of potassium.  Potassium-sparing diuretics act primarily by antagonizing this effect of aldosterone. $Some potassium-sparing diuretics, such as amiloride and triamterene, function by directly blocking the epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs) in the apical membrane of principal cells.  Others, including spironolactone and eplerenone, competitively inhibit the aldosterone receptor, causing downregulation of both the apical ENaCs and basolateral Na+/K+ pumps.  Spironolactone and eplerenone (a more specific receptor antagonist than spironolactone with fewer side effects) are preferred in patients with heart failure because they can also prevent the deleterious effects of #aldosterone-induced cardiac remodeling#. $#(Choice A)#  Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (eg, acetazolamide, dorzolamide) block sodium and bicarbonate reabsorption in the proximal convoluted tubule.

Patients with stable angina should be started on aspirin to decrease the risk of adverse cardiovascular events.  Aspirin impairs prostaglandin synthesis by irreversibly inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX).  Inhibition of COX-1 in platelets prevents synthesis of thromboxane A2, a potent stimulator of platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction.  This helps reduce the risk of occlusive thrombus formation and subsequent myocardial infarction. $Some patients are unable to tolerate aspirin due to exacerbation of preexisting respiratory symptoms (eg, rhinitis, asthma) or development of allergic reactions (eg, urticaria, angioedema, anaphylaxis).  In these patients, alternate antiplatelet agents should be used for prevention of cardiovascular events.  #Clopidogrel# irreversibly #blocks# the P2Y12 component of #ADP receptors# on the platelet surface and prevents platelet aggregation.

Eptifibatide is occasionally used in some patients with acute coronary syndrome, but it is not used for patients with stable CHD. $#(Choice F)#  Naproxen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is used for pain management in patients with osteoarthritis.

  "explanation_2": "This patient has a severe elevation in his #LDL# level.  This degree of hyperlipidemia, especially with a family history of coronary artery disease, suggests familial hypercholesterolemia and confers a very high risk for cardiovascular events.  #HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors# (statins) are the first-line therapy for most patients with hypercholesterolemia and have been proven to reduce the risk of cardiac events.  The statins are structural analogs of HMG-CoA and competitively inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme responsible for the rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis. $Serious side effects of statins include #myopathy# and #hepatitis#.  Although mild elevations of liver enzymes are common, significant liver injury (aspartate transaminase/alanine transaminase levels more than 3 times the upper limit of normal) is seen in less than 1% of patients and is usually reversible if the medication is discontinued.  #Liver function tests# are recommended before starting statin therapy; otherwise, routine monitoring is not necessary unless symptoms of hepatic injury develop (eg, fatigue, malaise, anorexia). $#(Choice A)#  Apolipoprotein-B (Apo-B) is a structural protein found in atherogenic lipoprotein particles.  Each lipoprotein particle contains only a single Apo-B molecule, so measurement of Apo-B levels can quantify the LDL particle count.  Patients with increased LDL particle counts are at greater risk for cardiovascular events.  However, measurement is of limited clinical utility and would not change management in this case. $#(Choice B)#  Statin medications do not cause any significant hematologic toxicity. $#(Choice C)#  Lipoprotein lipase deficiency can cause familial hypertriglyceridemia (heterozygous deficiency) and chylomicronemia (homozygous deficiency) syndromes.  These conditions present with elevated serum triglyceride levels but do not cause elevation in LDL levels. $#(Choice E)#  Because cholesterol is a precursor in the synthesis of adrenocortical and gonadal steroid hormones, statin medications can, in theory, cause hypogonadism or hypoadrenalism.  Clinically, however, there are no significant alterations in serum cortisol or gonadal steroid levels unless patients are also on other adrenal enzyme inhibitors (eg, ketoconazole, aminoglutethimide). $#(Choice F)#  Statins have no significant renal side effects.  In rare instances, they can cause rhabdomyolysis, which can precipitate acute renal failure; however, this occurs less commonly than hepatic dysfunction and would be associated with myalgias and myoglobinuria. $#Educational objective# Common side effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) include muscle and liver toxicity.  Hepatic transaminases should be checked prior to initiating therapy and repeated if symptoms of hepatic injury occur. "

  "explanation_2": "$#Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation# is usually treated with rate or rhythm control strategies.  Rate control uses AV nodal-blocking drugs (beta blockers, calcium channel blockers) to prevent rapid ventricular response, whereas #rhythm control# attempts to maintain sinus rhythm with antiarrhythmic drugs (eg, sotalol, flecainide, amiodarone). $The QT interval represents both ventricular depolarization and repolarization (total duration of ventricular action potential).  However, ventricular depolarization normally contributes only a small amount of time to the interval, and in practice, the QT interval is primarily used as a measure of ventricular repolarization.  #Class III antiarrhythmics# (eg, sotalol, amiodarone, dofetilide) predominantly #block potassium channels# and inhibit outward repolarizing currents during phase 3 of the cardiomyocyte action potential.  This leads to increased action potential duration and #QT interval prolongation#, which predisposes to the development of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (#torsades de pointes# [TdP]).  Amiodarone has a lesser proarrhythmic effect than other class III drugs; therefore, TdP is less frequently observed with amiodarone than with sotalol. $#(Choice A)#  Diltiazem is a class IV antiarrhythmic drug (calcium channel blocker) that inhibits L-type calcium channels during phase 2 (@cardiomyocyte action potential@) and phase 0 (nodal action potential) depolarization.  It slows the sinus rate, prolongs conduction through the AV node, and depresses myocardial contractility (negative inotropic effect) but does not prolong the QT interval. $#(Choice B)#  Metoprolol is a class II antiarrhythmic drug that is a selective beta-1 receptor antagonist.  It acts as a negative inotropic and chronotropic agent by decreasing myocardial contractility and heart rate.  Unlike sotalol, beta blockers do not have any potassium channel-blocking properties and do not prolong the QT interval. $#(Choice C)#  Mexiletine is a class IB antiarrhythmic drug that blocks sodium channels, inhibiting the initial depolarization phase (phase 0) of the cardiomyocyte action potential.  It is occasionally used to maintain sinus rhythm in patients with paroxysmal symptomatic atrial fibrillation, but it does not prolong the QT interval. $#(Choice D)#  Ranolazine is an antianginal agent and exerts its effect by inhibiting the late phase of inward sodium channels in ischemic cardiac myocytes.  It also blocks potassium channels and causes a dose-dependent increase in QT interval; however, TdP has not been reported in ranolazine use. $#Educational objective# Sotalol has both beta adrenergic-blocking and class III antiarrhythmic (K+ channel-blocking) properties and is occasionally used in treatment of atrial fibrillation.

  "explanation_2": "$#Amiodarone# is a @class III antiarrhythmic drug@ used for the management of a variety of supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias.  Class III drugs predominantly block #potassium channels# and inhibit the outward potassium currents during @phase 3@ of the cardiac action potential, prolonging repolarization and total action potential duration (APD). $The #QT interval# represents the time required for ventricular depolarization and repolarization; it can be regarded as a rough estimate of the APD.  Drugs that significantly prolong the cardiac action potential (eg, class IA and III antiarrhythmics) cause prolongation of the QT interval.  Prolonged QT is associated with a form of ventricular tachycardia called @torsades de pointes@ (polymorphic ventricular tachycardia).  However, unlike other drugs that cause QT prolongation, amiodarone has #very little risk# of inducing torsades de pointes.  This effect is thought to be due to it having a more homogeneous effect on ventricular repolarization compared to other drugs (ie, less QT dispersion). $#(Choice A)#  Adenosine interacts with A1 receptors on cardiac cells and activates potassium channels, increasing potassium conductance.  It causes a transient conduction delay through the atrioventricular (AV) node and is used for acute termination of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT).  Adenosine is rapidly metabolized in the blood and tissues and has a very brief duration of action. $#(Choice C)#  Digoxin slows AV nodal conduction speed by augmenting vagal parasympathetic tone and increases cardiac contractility by inhibiting Na+/K+-ATPase (increases intracellular calcium).  It also decreases the APD and can cause QT interval shortening. $#(Choice D)#  Esmolol is a rapidly acting, short-duration beta blocker (class II antiarrhythmic) that slows the rate of discharge of sinus or ectopic pacemakers and increases the refractory period of the AV node.  It has no effect on QT interval. $#(Choice E)#  Lidocaine is a class IB antiarrhythmic drug that acts by blocking sodium channels and inhibiting phase 0 depolarization.  It does not prolong the QT interval. $#(Choice F)#  Procainamide is a class IA antiarrhythmic drug that inhibits sodium-dependent (phase 0) depolarization.  It also has moderate potassium channel blocking activity, leading to prolongation of APD and the QT interval with an increased risk of torsades de pointes. $#(Choice G)#  Verapamil is a cardio-selective calcium channel blocker (class IV antiarrhythmic drug).  It slows the sinus rate and prolongs the PR interval by slowing conduction through the AV node.  It does not prolong the QT interval. $#Educational objective# Amiodarone (and other class III and class IA antiarrhythmic agents) causes lengthening of the cardiac action potential, which manifests as QT interval prolongation on ECG.  QT prolongation caused by amiodarone, in contrast to other drugs, is associated with a very low risk of torsades de pointes.  ",

In response to these changes, hepatocytes increase their surface expression of the #LDL receptor# to increase uptake of circulating LDL.

This risk reduction is greater than that seen with other classes of lipid-lowering medications and is likely due to additional properties of statins.  Besides effects on lipids, statins have anti-inflammatory properties, improve endothelial dysfunction, and appear to stabilize atherosclerotic plaques. $#(Choice A)#  ApoB-100 is an apoprotein present in VLDL and LDL.  Decreases in circulating LDL and VLDL will cause the ApoB-100 concentration to decrease as well. $#(Choice B)#  The biliary excretion of cholesterol decreases in patients on statins due to decreased de novo hepatic synthesis of cholesterol. $#(Choice D)#  Statins lower serum triglycerides modestly and have only a minimal effect on plasma free fatty acid concentrations. $#(Choice E)#  Statins produce small decreases in VLDL.  Fibrates and nicotinic acid therapy decrease hepatic production of VLDL and are the mainstay of treatment for primary hypertriglyceridemia (increased VLDL). $#Educational objective# Treatment with statins causes hepatocytes to increase their LDL receptor density, leading to increased uptake of circulating LDL.

The toxicity is dependent on the cumulative dose of anthracycline; affected patients develop symptoms of heart failure (eg, dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, peripheral edema) anywhere from several weeks to years following treatment. $Anthracyclines exert their antitumor effect by binding to the #topoisomerase II# enzyme in cancer cells to create DNA cleavage complexes that #break DNA# and cause cell death.  Anthracycline cardiotoxicity results from a similar anthracycline–topoisomerase II complex that forms in healthy cardiomyocytes.  In addition, anthracycline can form iron-containing complexes that produce DNA-damaging free radicals, which likely also plays a role in cardiotoxicity. $The most effective method of preventing anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy is the administration of #dexrazoxane#, a chelating agent thought to both block the formation of iron-associated free radicals and inhibit the formation of anthracycline–topoisomerase II complexes in healthy cardiomyocytes. $#(Choice B)#  Focal myocardial scarring commonly results following a myocardial infarction. $#(Choice C)#  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is an autosomal dominant disorder often caused by mutation of the beta-myosin heavy chain. $#(Choice D)#  Pericardial thickening and fibrosis usually follow cardiac surgery, radiation therapy, or viral infections of the pericardium. $#(Choice E)#  Restrictive cardiomyopathy often occurs as the initial cardiac manifestation of infiltrative disease (eg, hemochromatosis, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis) or may occur with radiation therapy. $#(Choice F)#  Right ventricular pressure overload can occur with acute pulmonary embolism.

Most of the clinically useful agents bind within the pore of the channel during the @open and/or inactivated@ states; dissociation of the drug occurs during the resting state.  This state-dependent manner of binding causes a phenomenon in which tissues undergoing frequent depolarization become more susceptible to blockage (#use dependence#).  The faster the heart rate, the more time the Na+ channels spend in the open and inactivated states and the more that become blocked. $The binding strength of class I antiarrhythmics varies between the different subclasses, with #Class IB# agents (eg, lidocaine) having the #weakest binding# compared to other class I antiarrhythmics.  Dissociation from the channels occurs so rapidly that there is minimal cumulative effect over multiple cardiac cycles, resulting in little use dependence.  These drugs are more #selective for ischemic myocardium# because the elevated (less negative) resting membrane potential delays Na+ channel transition from the inactivated to the resting state, resulting in increased drug binding.  As such, class IB antiarrhythmics are useful for treating #ischemia-induced ventricular arrhythmias#. $In contrast, #class IC# agents (eg, propafenone, flecainide) have the strongest binding #(choice B)#.  They are the #slowest to dissociate# from the channel, which allows their blocking effects to accumulate over multiple cardiac cycles.  This leads to substantially greater blockade at higher heart rates (#high use dependence#), making them particularly effective at #terminating tachyarrhythmias#.  However, the prominent use-dependent effects of class IC drugs can cause an excessive delay in conduction speed that can promote arrhythmias, especially in patients with ischemic or structural heart disease. $#(Choice A)#  Disopyramide, quinidine, and procainamide are class IA antiarrhythmic drugs that have an intermediate dissociation speed.  The dissociation curve for the new drug shows that drug-channel dissociation is faster than with quinidine, indicating that it is most similar to a class IB antiarrhythmic agent such as lidocaine. $#(Choice D)#  Propranolol is a nonselective beta-adrenergic blocker (class II antiarrhythmic).  It causes decreased chronotropy and inotropy via beta-1 blockade. $#(Choice E)#  Class III antiarrhythmic drugs (amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide) act predominantly by blocking potassium channels and prolonging phase 3 repolarization.  Sotalol also has beta-blocking activity. $#(Choice F)#  Verapamil and diltiazem are calcium channel blockers that function as class IV antiarrhythmics due to their effects on cardiac slow-response tissue.  Although nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker as well, it is selective for vascular smooth muscle and does not have a notable effect on the heart. $#Educational objective# For class I antiarrhythmics, sodium-channel-binding strength is #IC > IA > IB#.  Use dependence describes the phenomenon in which higher heart rates lead to increased sodium channel blockade due to cumulative blocking effects over multiple cardiac cycles.  Class IC antiarrhythmics demonstrate the most use dependence due to their slow dissociation from the receptor, and class IB drugs have the least use dependence as they rapidly dissociate.  ",

This phenomenon is termed #permissiveness#; it occurs when a hormone has #no direct effect# on a physiologic process but #allows another hormone to exert its maximal effect# on that process.  Cortisol exerts its potentiating effect on vasoconstriction in part through upregulation of alpha-1 adrenergic receptors on vascular smooth muscle cells.  In adrenal insufficiency, low cortisol levels can contribute to hypotensive crisis by decreasing vascular responsiveness to norepinephrine and angiotensin II. $Cortisol also has a permissive effect on catecholamine-mediated bronchodilation and glucagon-mediated release of glucose from the liver. $#(Choices A and D)#  The combination of 2 drugs with similar actions can have a @synergistic or additive@ effect.

This occurs via the following 2 mechanisms: $• Beta blockers #reduce heart rate#, which lengthens diastolic filling time to increase LV end-diastolic volume (ie, preload) $• Beta blockers #reduce LV contractility#, which decreases the amount of blood ejected during ventricular systole (ie, increased end-systolic volume) $Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, verapamil) have similar effects and can be used in patients with a contraindication to beta blockers or as additional therapy for persistent symptoms. $#(Choice A)#  Some patients with HCM may experience anginal symptoms due to inadequate blood supply to the increased myocardial mass.

In the months following infarction, the affected myocardium undergoes fibroblastic proliferation and fibrosis to repair the necrotic region (ie, initial #remodeling# phase); disproportionate thinning of the infarcted area can lead to ballooning of affected segments and marked #LV cavity enlargement#.  Although LV cavity enlargement is initially beneficial as it acts as a compensatory mechanism for LV volume overload, progressive cavity enlargement (eg, eccentric hypertrophy) leads to @overwhelming wall stress@ and further worsening of LV contractile dysfunction.  With progressive dilation, the LV begins to assume a spherical, rather than its normal elliptical, shape. $Much of the deleterious remodeling that occurs following myocardial infarction is likely driven by neurohormonal signaling via #angiotensin II#.  Accordingly, #ACE inhibitors# (eg, lisinopril) #reduce the deleterious remodeling# that takes place following myocardial infarction, #minimizing LV dilation# and helping preserve LV function. $#(Choices B and C)#  Angiotensin II enhances post–myocardial infarction collagen deposition to contribute to deleterious cardiac remodeling.  This effect is especially prominent in peri-infarct cardiomyocytes (cardiomyocytes at the edge of an infarction), which have high angiotensin II levels.  ACE inhibitors reduce deleterious cardiac remodeling at least in part via inhibition of myocardial collagen deposition and fibrosis. $#(Choice D)#  Noninfarcted cardiac segments (eg, the basal segments in this patient) are subject to postinfarction remodeling caused by LV hemodynamic influences (eg, pressure and volume changes).  ACE inhibitors also reduce remodeling of these segments, further contributing to maintenance of the normal LV elliptical shape and preservation of LV contractile function. $#(Choice E)#  Stroke work is the work done by the left ventricle with each contraction and is estimated by the product of stroke volume and LV systolic pressure (ie, stroke volume × LV systolic pressure).  ACE inhibitors reduce stroke work by causing peripheral vasodilation and reducing systemic blood pressure (ie, reducing the pressure the left ventricle must overcome during each contraction). $#Educational objective# Following myocardial infarction, collagen deposition and fibrosis within the infarct region and eccentric hypertrophy of surviving myocytes can lead to progressive left ventricular (LV) dilation and worsening contractile dysfunction.  Because much of this remodeling is driven by neurohormonal signaling via angiotensin II, ACE inhibitors (eg, lisinopril) reduce deleterious cardiac remodeling following myocardial infarction, minimizing LV dilation and helping preserve contractile function.

  "explanation_2": "Adequate #rate control# (eg, resting heart rate <85/min) is important in #atrial fibrillation# because it minimizes symptoms and helps decrease the risk of tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.  Beta blockers (eg, metoprolol) #slow conduction# through the #atrioventricular (AV) node# via inhibition of sympathetic stimulation and are typically first-line therapy for rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation.  This patient was unable to tolerate the dose of metoprolol needed to maintain an appropriate resting heart rate; therefore, #digoxin# was added for increased rate control.  Digoxin slows conduction through the AV node via #increased parasympathetic (vagal) tone#. $Several mechanisms may explain the parasympathetic effects of digoxin.  Inhibition of the sodium-potassium ATPase pump in vagal afferent fibers sensitizes arterial baroreceptors (eg, carotid, aortic) and cardiac volume receptors, augmenting afferent input from the cardiovascular system to the brain.  In addition, digoxin enhances efferent parasympathetic ganglionic transmission, leading to #increased vagal output#. $This mechanism of increased parasympathetic tone is effective in controlling heart rate at rest but is limited in controlling heart rate during exercise, when sympathetic tone is high.  Therefore, digoxin is rarely used as monotherapy for rate control and is more typically combined with a beta blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (eg, verapamil, diltiazem). $#(Choices A and B)#  Decreased atrial refractoriness and decreased cardiomyocyte action potential duration both occur with digoxin, increasing the automaticity of the atrial myocardium and encouraging the development of atrial fibrillation and other atrial arrhythmias.  However, these effects are typically problematic only at toxic digoxin levels and at therapeutic levels are outweighed by the beneficial effect of increased parasympathetic tone. $#(Choice C)#  Digoxin increases (rather than decreases) Purkinje fiber automaticity, encouraging the development of ventricular arrhythmias (eg, ventricular tachycardia).  Like the proarrhythmic effects on the atrial myocardium, this effect is typically problematic only at toxic digoxin levels. $#(Choice E)#  Digoxin increases ventricular contractility (positive inotropy) by inhibiting the sodium-potassium ATPase pump to increase intracellular sodium and consequently @increase intracellular calcium@.  This effect can improve cardiac output and symptoms (eg, dyspnea, orthopnea) in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction, but it does not contribute to improved rate control. $#Educational objective# Digoxin can be used to improve ventricular rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation, as it decreases atrioventricular node conduction by increasing parasympathetic (vagal) tone.  Digoxin also has a positive inotropic effect that can be useful in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. ",

However, interference with post-receptor signaling can alter platelet function.  In particular, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) activates a family of enzymes known as the cAMP-dependent protein kinases, or protein kinase A, and leads to inhibition of platelet aggregation.  Agents that increase intra-platelet cAMP levels decrease platelet aggregation by preventing platelet shape change and granule release. $#Cilostazol# reduces #platelet activation# by inhibiting platelet phosphodiesterase, the enzyme responsible for the breakdown of cAMP.

The net effect is a decrease in claudication #symptoms# and an increase in pain-free walking distances in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD).  Patients with PAD should be initiated on a graded exercise program, which has also been shown to improve symptoms. $#(Choices A, E, and F)#  Abciximab is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits platelet aggregation by targeting the platelet IIb/IIIa receptor.  Heparin is an anticoagulant that potentiates antithrombin III, resulting in the inactivation of thrombin and other factors.

Patients with clinically significant PAD should take antiplatelet agents (aspirin or clopidogrel) to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events (secondary prevention), but antiplatelet agents do not improve PAD symptoms. $#(Choice G)#  Warfarin is an oral anticoagulant that is a competitive inhibitor of vitamin K epoxide reductase and reduces production of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors (II, VII, IX, X, protein C, protein S).  It is used in the long-term treatment and prevention of thromboembolic events but does not reduce claudication in symptomatic PAD. $#Educational objective# Symptomatic management of peripheral artery disease (PAD) includes a graded exercise program and cilostazol.

Appropriate pharmacologic management is important in such patients because it has been shown to reduce mortality.  Much of this #mortality benefit# is likely related to a #reduction# in deleterious #cardiac remodeling#. $Neurohormonal pathways involving norepinephrine, angiotensin II, and aldosterone all have a demonstrated role in cardiac remodeling.  In particular, elevated angiotensin II and aldosterone levels increase pathologic cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and stimulate collagen deposition by fibroblasts (cardiac fibrosis).  Accordingly, #ACE inhibitors# (eg, lisinopril), #angiotensin-receptor blockers# (eg, losartan), and #mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists# (eg, spironolactone, epleronone) reduce mortality in patients with HFrEF via a reduction in angiotensin II–mediated (and downstream aldosterone-mediated) cardiac remodeling. $#Beta blockers# (eg, metoprolol, carvedilol) also reduce mortality in patients with chronic HFrEF, likely through similar inhibition of neurohormonal mechanisms.  Potentiation of the natriuretic peptide neurohormonal pathway with #angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor# therapy (eg, sacubitril-valsartan) has also demonstrated mortality benefit in these patients. $#(Choice A)#  Blood pressure control is important for patients with heart failure because it slows the progression of coronary artery disease and may reduce cardiac remodeling that is triggered by increased left ventricular pressure load.  However, aside from the benefit of blood pressure reduction, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, amlodipine) provide no additional mortality benefit in patients with HFrEF. $#(Choice B)#  Digoxin is used as an adjunctive therapy in patients with HFrEF.  It improves symptoms, thereby reducing the rate of hospitalization, but does not improve mortality. $#(Choice C)#  Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, verapamil, diltiazem) can depress cardiac contractility and are usually contraindicated in patients with HFrEF. $#(Choices D and E)#  Loop (eg, furosemide) and thiazide (eg, metolazone) diuretics reduce cardiac preload and are useful for symptomatic management of patients with HFrEF; however, these drugs do not provide a clear mortality benefit. $#(Choice G)#  Although potassium-sparing diuretics that function via blockade of mineralocorticoid receptors have shown mortality benefit for HFrEF, those that act via blockade of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) (eg, triamterene, amiloride) have minimal neurohormonal effects and no demonstrated benefit. $#Educational objective# Neurohormones (eg, norepinephrine, angiotensin II, and aldosterone) play a large role in the deleterious cardiac remodeling that occurs in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.  ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, beta blockers, and angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors reduce mortality in these patients by reducing neurohormonal-mediated cardiac remodeling.

Statins are an effective treatment for hypercholesteremia and are now routinely prescribed for all patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease, regardless of baseline cholesterol levels.  Myopathy is the most common complication of statin use, and symptoms can range from myalgia or myopathy, with or without myonecrosis (elevated serum creatine kinase), to frank rhabdomyolysis. $Statins act through competitive #inhibition# of #HMG-CoA reductase#, preventing conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid (the rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis).  Decreased liver cholesterol synthesis leads to increased hepatic clearance of LDL from the circulation by LDL receptors.  After mediating endocytosis of LDL particles, the LDL receptors are returned to the cell surface for reuse (receptor recycling); LDL is digested and used for metabolic purposes.  This #increase in LDL receptor recycling# allows intrahepatic cholesterol levels to remain at normal levels while blood levels are kept low. $#(Choice A)#  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs inhibit cyclooxygenase (prostaglandin synthase), leading to decreased synthesis of gastric mucosal prostaglandin. $#(Choice B)#  Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II.  ACE also acts as a kininase, and ACE inhibition also leads to increased plasma bradykinin levels. $#(Choice C)#  Stimulation of beta-2 receptors by catecholamines increases extracellular potassium movement into cells.  This effect is blocked by beta-blockers (primarily non-selective agents such as propranolol or labetalol), which impair potassium entry into cells and cause minor elevations in plasma potassium. $#(Choice E)#  Thiazide diuretics increase calcium reabsorption in the distal tubule of the nephron and can lead to hypercalcemia.  In contrast, decreased calcium excretion is useful in patients with renal stones due to hypercalciuria. $#(Choice F)#  Metformin inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis via inhibition of the mitochondrial isoform of glycerophosphate dehydrogenase in the liver.  Typical side effects of metformin include gastrointestinal upset and diarrhea.  Myopathy is not a common effect. $#Educational objective# Statins inhibit the intracellular rate-limiting step of cholesterol biosynthesis via competitive inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase.

The Na+-K+-ATPase pump allows the potassium and sodium gradients to be maintained across the membrane. $The ion flow graph after drug A administration shows a #decrease in outward potassium flow# from the myocyte during phase 3 repolarization of the myocardial action potential.

Digoxin does not affect potassium channels and has minimal effect on potassium efflux from myocardial cells during the action potential. $#(Choice D)#  Esmolol is a rapid-acting, short-duration beta blocker (class II antiarrhythmic) that slows the rate of discharge of sinus or ectopic pacemakers and increases the refractory period of the AV node.

When beta-adrenergic blockade is abruptly withdrawn, the increased density of beta-adrenergic receptors creates an amplified response to circulating catecholamines (ie, #increased sensitivity#). $Because metoprolol is cardioselective and primarily blocks beta-1 receptors, abrupt cessation stimulates beta-1 receptor–mediated #increased heart rate# and #cardiac contractility#.  There is also #increased blood pressure# due to increased cardiac output.  These changes create #increased oxygen demand# that may cause ischemia (evidenced by ST depression on ECG) and trigger #angina# in patients with underlying coronary artery disease. $#(Choice A)#  Beta blocker withdrawal symptoms result from an increase in the density of beta-adrenergic receptors, leading to an amplified response to circulating catecholamines.  The level of circulating catecholamines is unchanged from baseline. $#(Choice B)#  Alpha-adrenergic receptors are predominantly activated in the setting of beta blockade.  On cessation of beta blocker therapy, there is redistribution of catecholamines to beta-adrenergic receptors. $#(Choice C)#  Beta-adrenergic receptors function via cyclic AMP @second messaging@.  The increased stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors following beta blocker cessation leads to increased cyclic AMP activity. $#(Choice D)#  Downregulation of surface membrane receptors occurs when cells are exposed to frequent agonist activity.  For example, prolonged use of an alpha-1 agonist nasal spray (eg, phenylephrine) causes downregulation of alpha-1 receptors and reduced sensitivity to endogenous catecholamines.  This is opposite to what is occurring in this patient. $#Educational objective# When exposed to a prolonged environmental stimulus, cells can adjust their sensitivity to the stimulus by upregulating or downregulating surface membrane receptors.  Prolonged beta blockade leads to upregulation of beta-adrenergic receptors and increased sensitivity to circulating catecholamines, causing an enhanced beta-adrenergic response on abrupt beta blocker cessation (ie, beta blocker withdrawal syndrome).

  "explanation_2": "This patient is exhibiting symptoms consistent with #paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT)#.  As the name implies, PSVT comes on suddenly and the focus of automaticity lies above the ventricles (ie, atria or atrioventricular node).  When due to development of a #reentrant circuit#, the tachyarrhythmia may be terminated by the administration of #adenosine#. $Adenosine is a coronary arteriole vasodilator, but it also affects cardiac conduction.  As an anti-arrhythmic, it acts by hyperpolarizing the nodal pacemaker and conducting cells to briefly #block conduction through the atrioventricular node#.  Its effects are rapid-onset and short-lived (half-life <10 seconds); by temporarily blocking signal conduction from the atria to the ventricles, administration of the drug will often terminate the reentrant circuit and lead to conversion of PSVT to normal sinus rhythm. $The most frequent #adverse effects# associated with adenosine are flushing, chest burning (due to bronchospasm), hypotension, and high-grade atrioventricular block. $#(Choice B)#  Amiodarone (class III anti-arrhythmic) is one of the broadest-spectrum anti-arrhythmic drugs available, and can be used to treat both supraventricular (eg, PSVT, atrial fibrillation) and ventricular arrhythmias.  It has a wide range of adverse effects, including photodermatitis, blue/gray skin discoloration, pulmonary fibrosis, liver toxicity, and hyper- or hypothyroidism. $#(Choice C)#  Digoxin slows conduction through the atrioventricular node and is useful in treating supraventricular tachycardia, especially atrial fibrillation.  It causes a well-characterized toxicity in overdose; symptoms include fatigue, yellow-tinted vision, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, and confusion. $#(Choice D)#  Ibutilide (class III anti-arrhythmic) is used in the treatment of atrial fibrillation and flutter.  Its principal adverse effect is QTc prolongation leading to torsades de pointes. $#(Choice E)#  Lidocaine (class IB anti-arrhythmic) is sometimes used for ventricular arrhythmias but has little utility for supraventricular arrhythmias.  Lidocaine toxicity most commonly causes neurologic symptoms or arrhythmias. $#(Choice F)#  Verapamil (class IV anti-arrhythmic) is the most cardioselective of the calcium channel blockers, and is often used in the treatment of supraventricular tachycardia.  Common adverse reactions noted with verapamil are bradycardia and constipation.

The QT interval represents both ventricular depolarization and repolarization (total duration of ventricular action potential).  However, since ventricular depolarization (QRS duration) contributes only a small amount of time to the interval, the #QT interval# is primarily a measure of #ventricular repolarization#. $Ventricular depolarization occurs due to the opening of #voltage-dependent sodium channels#.

Their moderate potassium channel-blocking activity also causes significant QT interval prolongation. $• Class 1B drugs (eg, lidocaine) have no significant effect on the QRS duration and do not prolong the QT interval due to their rapid dissociation from the receptor. $• Class IC drugs (eg, flecainide, propafenone) are strong sodium channel blockers that prolong QRS duration in a rate-dependent manner.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient's retrosternal chest pain brought on by exertion and relieved with rest is classic for #stable angina#.  It is caused by atherosclerotic narrowing of the coronary arteries such that an adequate increase in myocardial blood flow (and oxygen supply) cannot be achieved to meet the increased myocardial oxygen demand of exercise.  Medical therapy for stable angina is aimed at relieving this #myocardial oxygen supply/demand mismatch#. $#Nitrates# are commonly used to treat stable angina.  Long-acting formulations (eg, isosorbide dinitrate) are used for prevention of stable angina, and short-acting formulations (eg, sublingual nitroglycerin) are used as an abortive agent when symptoms occur.  The primary effect of nitrates is #venodilation#, which causes additional blood to remain in the capacitance veins and reduces venous return to the heart.  The resulting #decrease# in left ventricular (#LV#) #end-diastolic volume# (ie, reduced preload) decreases #LV wall stress# to reduce myocardial #oxygen demand# and relieve angina symptoms. $#(Choice A)#  Decreased heart rate reduces myocardial oxygen demand.  Beta blockers (eg, metoprolol) and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, verapamil) treat stable angina in part via this mechanism, but nitrates have no direct effect on heart rate (and may cause a reflexive increase in heart rate). $#(Choice C)#  Decreased peripheral arteriolar resistance decreases cardiac afterload to reduce LV wall stress and decrease myocardial oxygen demand.  Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, amlodipine) treat stable angina via this mechanism, but nitrates cause only slight peripheral arteriolar vasodilation. $#(Choices D and E)#  Nitrates do stimulate some degree of coronary arteriolar vasodilation, but this mechanism has little effect on relieving angina symptoms.  Coronary arterioles with substantial atherosclerotic disease are already nearly fully dilated at baseline such that the capacity for further dilation to recruit additional blood flow is minimal.  Nitrates can also slightly augment the coronary perfusion pressure gradient (ie, aortic diastolic pressure − LV diastolic pressure) by decreasing LV end-diastolic volume.  This may slightly increase coronary blood flow and myocardial oxygen supply, but the reduction in myocardial oxygen demand via decreased LV wall stress is a much larger contributor to relief of angina symptoms. $#Educational objective# Sublingual nitroglycerin is used for rapid symptom relief in patients with stable angina.  The primary anti-ischemic effect of nitrates is mediated by venodilation causing a decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic volume and wall stress, resulting in decreased myocardial oxygen demand.

  "explanation_2": "This patient with episodes of #recurrent chest discomfort# that spontaneously #resolve within 10-15 minutes# most likely has #vasospastic angina# (formerly called Prinzmetal angina).  It results from coronary #endothelial dysfunction# and autonomic imbalance that lead to #intermittent coronary vasospasm# and #myocardial ischemia#.  Affected patients are usually young (eg, age <50) and lack typical risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) (eg, hypertension, diabetes mellitus); however, #smoking# is a strong risk factor, likely because it contributes to endothelial dysfunction. $Symptoms of vasospastic angina are thought to be triggered by #excess vagal tone#, and they occur most commonly #at night# when vagal tone is at a peak.  The diagnosis is made by ambulatory ECG demonstrating ST-segment elevation during an episode of chest discomfort and coronary angiography revealing an absence of obstructive atherosclerotic CAD.  Because of the pathophysiology of the disorder, both #acetylcholine# and #ergot alkaloids# (eg, dihydroergotamine) provoke symptoms and may also aid in diagnosis, as follows: $• Acetylcholine normally stimulates endothelial muscarinic receptors to cause vasodilation via increased release of nitric oxide.  However, a #deficiency of endothelial nitric oxide# in affected patients causes increased vagal tone to instead trigger #vasoconstriction# and precipitate vasospastic symptoms. $• Ergot alkaloids activate 5-HT2 serotonergic receptors to cause vasoconstriction.  Normally, the vasoconstriction is somewhat offset by endothelial release of vasodilatory prostaglandins, but this response is lacking in affected patients due to endothelial dysfunction. $#(Choices A and C)#  Peripheral endothelial function is typically intact in patients with vasospastic angina.  As a result, acetylcholine is expected to cause peripheral vasodilation, which decreases venous return (due to venodilation).  Systemic vascular resistance is also decreased, which can lower systemic blood pressure and somewhat reduce coronary artery perfusion pressure.  However, this is unlikely to cause myocardial ischemia in the absence of obstructive CAD. $#(Choice D)#  Acetylcholine has a negative inotropic effect, reducing cardiac contractility and myocardial oxygen demand. $#(Choice E)#  Increased heart rate can increase myocardial oxygen demand and may exacerbate angina symptoms in patients with obstructive CAD, but it is unlikely to cause myocardial ischemia in the absence of CAD.  In addition, acetylcholine directly slows heart rate, counteracting any reflex tachycardia caused by peripheral vasodilation. $#Educational objective# Vasospastic angina is the result of intermittent coronary vasospasm caused by endothelial dysfunction and autonomic imbalance.  Although acetylcholine normally stimulates vasodilation, it triggers coronary vasospasm in affected patients due to a deficiency of vasodilatory endothelial nitric oxide.  "

Pharmacologic nitrates (eg, nitroglycerin, isosorbide mononitrate, isosorbide dinitrate) are metabolized to #nitric oxide and S-nitrosothiols# via mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase within vascular smooth muscle cells.  These compounds in turn activate guanylate cyclase and promote the conversion of guanosine triphosphate to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which leads to @dephosphorylation@ of myosin light chains and causes vascular smooth muscle relaxation. $Nitrates predominantly affect the #large veins#, where smooth muscle relaxation leads to #venodilation# and increased venous capacitance.  Cardiac venous return #(preload) is reduced#, leading to a reduction in left ventricular end-diastolic volume and pressure and a consequent decrease in left ventricular wall stress.  #Decreased myocardial oxygen demand# leads to relief of anginal symptoms. $#(Choice A)#  Both beta blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, verapamil) are negative inotropic and chronotropic agents.  They exert antianginal effects via direct actions on cardiac myocytes to reduce myocardial contractility and heart rate, and thereby decrease myocardial oxygen demand.  Nitrates have no direct effect on cardiac myocytes. $#(Choice B)#  Sodium nitroprusside generates nitric oxide while in the bloodstream (rather than within vascular smooth muscle cells) and is much less selective for the large veins than nitrates.  It causes relatively balanced vasodilation of both the large arteries and veins, and is useful for reducing blood pressure in patients with hypertensive emergency. $#(Choice D)#  Precapillary sphincters are bands of smooth muscle that regulate blood flow from arterioles into mesenteric capillary beds.  The effect of nitrates on precapillary sphincters is minimal compared to that on the large veins. $#(Choice E)#  Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, nifedipine, amlodipine, nicardipine) block L-type calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle cells to trigger vasodilation.  This effect is exerted on small arteries and arterioles in both the peripheral and coronary circulation, resulting in 2 therapeutic effects on stable angina.  The peripheral vasodilation reduces afterload leading to a decrease in cardiac work and myocardial oxygen demand, and the coronary vasodilation increases myocardial oxygen supply. $#Educational objective# Pharmacologic nitrates (eg, nitroglycerin, isosorbide mononitrate, isosorbide dinitrate) are metabolized to nitric oxide and S-nitrothiols in vascular smooth muscle cells, leading to an increase in cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) that stimulates vasodilation.

  "explanation_2": "This patient's syncopal episodes are due to bradycardia and decreased peripheral vascular resistance caused by #clonidine#.  Clonidine is used in the treatment of severe or refractory hypertension.  It exerts its effects on both heart rate and blood pressure by #stimulating presynaptic alpha-2 adrenergic receptors# in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (area responsible for basal and reflex control of sympathetic activity).  This effect results in a subsequent #decrease in presynaptic release of norepinephrine# and decreased sympathetic outflow causing both #bradycardia# and a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance. $Normally, to maintain cerebral perfusion while standing, a baroreceptor-mediated @increase in sympathetic drive@ causes vasoconstriction to increase peripheral resistance and increased heart rate and contractility to aid cardiac output.  These changes facilitate a corrective increase in blood pressure to prevent a drop in cerebral perfusion.  However, when an orthostatic stress is applied (eg, upright posture) to this patient with #attenuated sympathetic outflow# due to clonidine, she is unable to maintain cerebral perfusion and syncope results. $Lisinopril and amlodipine can also contribute to orthostatic syncope by impairing peripheral vasoconstriction, but their effects are not as profound as those of clonidine because they do not affect heart rate; in fact, they may result in reflex tachycardia. $#(Choice A)#  Decreased presynaptic release of acetylcholine occurs with certain toxins (eg, botulinum) and some medications (eg, aminoglycoside antibiotics).  This effect leads to muscle weakness and does not contribute to syncope. $#(Choice C)#  Beta blockers (eg, atenolol) block beta-1 adrenoreceptors in the sinoatrial node, which can lead to bradycardia and contribute to orthostatic syncope.  Clonidine does not block adrenoreceptors; it reduces central sympathetic output. $#(Choice D)#  Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, diltiazem, verapamil) block calcium channels in the atrioventricular node and ventricular myocardium, resulting in slowed cardiac conduction (ie, heart rate) and decreased contractility, which can contribute to orthostatic syncope.  Amlodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, has minimal effect on the heart and functions primarily as a direct vasodilator. $#(Choice E)#  Class III antiarrhythmics (eg, dofetilide) bind to and block the potassium channels responsible for phase 3 repolarization of the cardiac action potential.  This effect does not contribute to orthostatic syncope, but it can prolong the QT interval and increase the risk of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (ie, torsade de pointes), a serious cause of cardiac syncope. $#Educational objective# Clonidine, an antihypertensive agent, stimulates central alpha-2 adrenergic receptors, causing a decrease in presynaptic release of norepinephrine and a decrease in sympathetic outflow.

These reflexive changes slightly attenuate the initial increase in blood pressure and lead to overall reduced cardiac output. $#(Choices A and D)#  Dobutamine is primarily a beta-1 agonist with partial activity on beta-2 receptors and minimal effect on alpha receptors.  It increases heart rate and myocardial contractility (via beta-1 stimulation) and causes mild vasodilation (via beta-2 stimulation) to decrease SVR.  Milrinone is not an adrenergic agonist, but it inhibits phosphodiesterase 3 to increase myocardial contractility and cause peripheral vasodilation (decreases SVR).

Administration of these agents leads to breakdown of fibrin clot and often restoration of myocardial perfusion; some patients develop a self-limiting reperfusion-related arrhythmia (most commonly an accelerated idioventricular rhythm). $In the #fibrinolytic pathway#, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is released by the endothelium and cleaves plasminogen to form plasmin.

These drugs are used together in acute STEMI to prevent the development of additional platelet thrombus; however, they do not cause lysis of existing thrombus. $#(Choice E)#  Heparin potentiates the activity of antithrombin III to inhibit thrombin and factor Xa and exert an anticoagulation effect.  Heparin is used in acute STEMI to prevent further progression of clot formation, but it does not cause thrombolysis. $#(Choice G)#  Statins (eg, rosuvastatin) are used for acute STEMI as they may stabilize atherosclerotic plaques, reduce vascular inflammation, and promote long-term regression of atherosclerosis.

Renin release is stimulated by decreased sodium delivery to the distal tubule, low blood pressure (eg, low intravascular volume), and β1 sympathetic activity.  Renin converts angiotensinogen to angiotensin I.  Angiotensin I is then converted to angiotensin II by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which also degrades bradykinin.  Angiotensin II stimulates the #type 1 angiotensin II receptors# found on vascular smooth muscle (causing vasoconstriction) and the adrenal cortex (stimulating aldosterone secretion).  Systemic vasoconstriction and increased aldosterone-induced sodium reabsorption raise blood pressure, inhibiting further renin release from the kidneys (negative feedback). $#Angiotensin II receptor blockers# (ARBs) such as losartan competitively bind to angiotensin II receptors and block the effects of angiotensin II, resulting in #vascular smooth muscle relaxation# and #decreased aldosterone# secretion.  This reduces blood pressure, stimulating renal renin production, which in turn increases conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II.  Because ACE function remains intact with the use of ARBs, bradykinin levels are not significantly affected.  This is in contrast to ACE inhibitors, which lower angiotensin II and aldosterone levels but increase bradykinin levels #(choice C).#  Bradykinin is thought to increase prostaglandin production, which induces coughing due to bronchial irritation. $#(Choice A)#  β1 adrenergic blockers would inhibit renin release from the juxtaglomerular apparatus, thereby suppressing the entire renin-angiotensin cascade (although lowering of the blood pressure would somewhat blunt this response).  ACE activity is not regulated by renin, and so bradykinin levels are unchanged. $#(Choice B)#  Direct renin inhibitors reduce plasma renin activity, which reduces levels of all downstream hormones.  Suppression of the whole cascade lowers blood pressure, which would stimulate increased renin production.  Plasma renin activity, however, is inhibited. $#(Choice E)#  This combination of changes is seen with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (eg, spironolactone) or diuretic use.  Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists block aldosterone activity by binding to the mineralocorticoid receptor.  Diuretics would cause a fall in blood pressure, stimulating the RAAS and increasing blood levels of all hormones. $#Educational objective# Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) work by blocking angiotensin II type 1 receptors, inhibiting the effects of angiotensin II.  This results in arterial vasodilation and decreased aldosterone secretion.  The resulting fall in blood pressure increases renin, angiotensin I, and angiotensin II levels.  ARBs do not affect the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme, and therefore they do not affect bradykinin degradation and do not cause cough.  "

Because vasodilatory nitrates (eg, nitroglycerin, isosorbide mononitrate) work by releasing NO, coadministration of sildenafil with nitrates can lead to excessive cGMP-induced vasodilation and severe hypotension. $#(Choice A)#  1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol is the active form of vitamin D; it is a sterol vitamin that freely crosses cell membranes and interacts with a receptor that primarily resides in the nucleus. $#(Choice C)#  Gamma-aminobutyric acid is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that acts to hyperpolarize nerve cells by binding ligand-gated ion channels or metabotropic receptors. $#(Choice D)#  The insulin receptor consists of 2 alpha and 2 beta subunits.  The alpha subunits are extracellular and provide the binding site for insulin.  The beta subunits are intracellular and contain tyrosine kinase domains. $#(Choice E)#  Interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor is a transmembrane protein complex that acts via a multipathway system, including a JAK-STAT signaling component, a MAP kinase pathway, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase. $#(Choice F)#  Platelet-derived growth factor stimulates cell growth and division, including angiogenesis.  It acts via a tyrosine kinase receptor. $#Educational objective# Atrial natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide, and nitric oxide activate guanylyl cyclase and increase conversion of guanosine 5′-triphosphate to cyclic guanosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cGMP).  Phosphodiesterase inhibitors (eg, sildenafil) decrease the degradation of cGMP.  Elevated intracellular cGMP levels lead to relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and vasodilation.  "

HDL is involved in reverse cholesterol transport; it helps to remove cholesterol from peripheral tissues and transports it to the liver for metabolism.  This is accomplished through 2 different pathways.  In the direct pathway, HDL delivers cholesterol esters directly to the liver via a scavenger receptor (SCARB1) on the hepatocyte cell membrane.  In the indirect pathway, the cholesterol in HDL is transferred to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) by the cholesteryl ester transfer protein. $Nonpharmacologic measures such as exercise, weight loss, and smoking cessation help to raise HDL levels and have significant cardiovascular benefits.  In contrast, use of medications to raise HDL levels does #not# improve cardiovascular outcomes.

Bile acid binding resins can significantly increase triglyceride levels in patients with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia.  In addition, cationic exchange resins have not been proven to prevent cardiac events. $#(Choice D)#  Omega-3 essential fatty acids are sometimes used for hyperlipidemia treatment.  They cause a decrease in serum triglycerides and a slight increase in HDL concentration but do not appear to significantly reduce cardiovascular events. $#(Choice E)#  Niacin (vitamin B3) given in pharmacologic doses is the most effective agent for raising HDL levels, but does not reduce the risk of cardiovascular events and is associated with adverse effects (eg, flushing, hyperglycemia).  It is primarily used for patients who have failed other lipid-lowering drugs. $#(Choice F)#  Fibrates activate peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor alpha, a transcription factor that increases lipoprotein lipase activity.

As a result, CoNS are a major cause of infection in patients with indwelling catheters or implanted foreign bodies (eg, peritoneal dialysis catheters, vascular grafts) and a common cause of prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE).  For example, Staphylococcus epidermidis (a type of CoNS) can cause an indolent endocarditis following valve replacement; if left untreated, it can lead to intracardiac abscess, prosthetic valve dehiscence, and septic embolization.  As CoNS are a component of normal skin flora, it may be difficult initially to distinguish blood culture contamination from true infection; however, recovery of the same organism from several blood culture bottles indicates infection. $Most (>80%) CoNS strains are methicillin-resistant.

They inhibit the L-type calcium channel on vascular smooth muscle and cardiac cells and are divided into 2 major categories based on their predominant actions:  $1. #Dihydropyridines# (nifedipine, amlodipine, felodipine) primarily affect #arterial smooth muscle#, causing vasodilation with little or no effect on cardiac conduction or contractility.  $2. #Nondihydropyridines# (verapamil, diltiazem) affect the #myocardium#, slowing heart rate (negative chronotropic effect) and reducing contractility (negative inotropic effect). $This patient's ECG shows sinus bradycardia (rate <60/min) with first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block (PR interval >200 msec).  Of the choices above, nifedipine is the most appropriate agent to manage hypertension as it has minimal effect on cardiac conduction.  Dihydropyridines can cause reflex tachycardia in response to peripheral vasodilation and are therefore useful in hypertensive patients with resting bradycardia. $#(Choices A and E)#  Verapamil is a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker with a significant depressive effect on cardiac conduction.  Diltiazem has combined effects and acts at both the myocardium and peripheral arterial beds.  These medications can worsen bradycardia and AV block and should not be used in patients with underlying conduction abnormalities. $#(Choices B and D)#  Metoprolol is a cardioselective beta blocker with negative chronotropic and dromotropic (decreased AV conduction) effects.  Sotalol is a class III antiarrhythmic drug with significant beta-blocking properties.  These drugs can worsen bradycardia and AV conduction defects and would not be recommended for this patient. $#Educational objective# Calcium channel blockers inhibit the L-type calcium channel on vascular smooth muscle and cardiac cells.  Dihydropyridines (eg, nifedipine, amlodipine) primarily affect peripheral arteries and cause vasodilation.  Nondihydropyridines (eg, verapamil, diltiazem) affect the myocardium and can cause bradycardia and slowed atrioventricular conduction.  "

  "explanation_2": "Around-the-clock nitrate administration (in any form) rapidly results in development of tolerance to nitrates.  This is why a nitrate-free interval must be provided every day in patients that are using daily long acting nitrates.  The mechanism by which this occurs has not been fully demonstrated, but it is theorized that it is due to a decreased vascular sensitivity to nitrates and an increased sensitivity to endogenous vasoconstricting agents.  Usually the nitrate-free period is timed to occur during the night when the patient is sleeping and cardiac work is the least. $#(Choice A)#  A pharmacokinetic drug interaction refers to how drugs that are used together in a patient affect the absorption and elimination of each other.  An example of this is the ability of rifampin to increase the metabolism and elimination of warfarin by inducing cytochrome P-450.  This is not the reason for providing a nitrate-free interval. $#(Choice B)#  Pharmacodynamic drug antagonism refers to the ability of a drug, as part of its mechanism of action, to antagonize, or prevent, the effect of another drug or endogenous substance.  An example of this is the effect that labetalol has on alpha-1 and beta adrenergic receptors – it prevents the binding of catecholamines to these receptors. $#(Choice C)#  Effect potentiation refers to one drug's ability to increase the pharmacologic effect of another agent.  The drugs mentioned in this question stem do not potentiate the effects of each other, and this is not the reason for providing a nitrate-free period.  Beta-adrenergic blockers are often prescribed along with nitrates to prevent reflex tachycardia as well as to provide decreased cardiac work by a mechanism different from that of nitrates. $#(Choice E)#  Withdrawal symptoms occur when a patient forms a physiologic dependence on a drug or medication and that drug or medication is then discontinued.  This is common in patients using alcohol, opiates, benzodiazepines, stimulants and some antidepressants.  This is not the reason for providing a nitrate-free period in patients taking nitrates. $#(Choice F)#  Drug noncompliance is a problem where patients do not take the medications prescribed to them properly or at all.  It is frequent among patients who do not understand their disease, can not afford medications, or simply can not remember to take them.  The latter becomes much more frequent when patients are taking multiple medications with many times-per-day dosing schedules.  This is also not the reason for providing a nitrate-free period every day in patients taking long-term nitrates. $#Educational objective# Patients taking daily maintenance nitrates need to have a nitrate-free period every day to avoid tolerance to the drug.

  "explanation_2": "This patient most likely has #QT interval prolongation#, a common adverse effect of #methadone#.  QT interval prolongation is the ECG manifestation of @delayed ventricular repolarization@, which occurs due to impairment of the voltage-gated potassium channels that control the delayed rectifier potassium current.  Significant slowing of ventricular repolarization can trigger #torsade de pointes# (TdP), a form of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia named for a repetitive \"@twisting of the peaks@\" pattern.  TdP is a serious arrhythmia that can cause palpitations, lightheadedness, #syncope#, and sudden cardiac death (SCD). $Many #medications#, including methadone, are known to #inhibit the delayed rectifier potassium current# to prolong the QT interval and predispose to TdP.  Methadone undergoes slow and variable hepatic clearance, making consistent avoidance of toxic blood levels challenging; therefore, the use of high doses of methadone increases the risk of QT interval prolongation and TdP. $#(Choice A)#  Advanced atrioventricular block (ie, Mobitz type II or @complete atrioventricular block@) can present with syncope.  Common causes include infection (eg, Lyme disease), ischemia, and medications (eg, beta blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers).  Methadone is not associated with atrioventricular block. $#(Choice B)#  Deep Q waves on ECG typically represent a previous myocardial infarction (MI).  Patients with a history of MI are at risk for @monomorphic ventricular tachycardia@ causing syncope or SCD, but a prior MI is unlikely in this relatively young patient without significant cardiovascular risk factors (eg, hypertension, smoking, family history). $#(Choice D)#  @Sinus pauses@ occur with sick sinus syndrome, which most commonly results from age-related degeneration of the conduction system.  Affected patients are usually age >65 and may experience progressive fatigue and episodes of syncope. $#(Choice E)#  Ventricular preexcitation is recognized by a slurred upslope of the QRS complex (@delta wave@) on ECG.  Patients with this characteristic Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) pattern may develop paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (ie, @WPW syndrome@), which can present with syncope or SCD.  However, the onset of WPW syndrome is usually age <40, and this patient's methadone use makes a prolonged QT interval more likely. $#Educational objective# Methadone slows the delayed rectifier potassium current responsible for ventricular repolarization, and high doses are associated with QT interval prolongation.  QT interval prolongation predisposes to the development of torsade de pointes, a serious ventricular arrhythmia that can cause syncope and sudden cardiac death.  ",

However, this patient's QRS duration is normal at rest and prolonged at near-maximal heart rate.  This suggests that the drug used to treat his atrial fibrillation lengthens the QRS duration in a rate-dependent manner, which is consistent with a drug exhibiting strong use-dependence such as flecainide. $#Flecainide# is a @class 1C antiarrhythmic@ that is typically used to treat supraventricular tachycardias such as those caused by atrial fibrillation.

This #prolongs the QRS duration# with little effect on total action potential or QT interval duration.  Class 1C drugs are the slowest of the class 1 agents to dissociate from the sodium channel, and do so primarily during diastole.  This results in a phenomenon known as #use-dependence#, in which their sodium-blocking effects intensify as the heart rate increases due to less time for the medication to dissociate from the receptor. $#(Choice A)#  Selective β1 blockers such as atenolol do not significantly affect QRS duration.  However, their use during exercise ECG testing can limit the maximal heart rate that is achieved. $#(Choice B)#  Digoxin can cause false-positive ST-segment depression during exercise ECG testing as well as lower the maximal achievable heart rate.  It does not significantly affect QRS duration. $#(Choice C)#  Dofetilide is a class III antiarrhythmic drug that blocks the outward potassium current during repolarization.

Class III agents demonstrate reverse use-dependence (the slower the heart rate, the more the QT interval is prolonged). $#(Choice E)#  Verapamil (a class IV antiarrhythmic) is a calcium channel blocker that slows sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodal conduction.  It also increases coronary blood flow and reduces myocardial oxygen demand, which can mask ischemia during stress testing.  Verapamil does not affect QRS duration. $#Educational objective# Class 1C antiarrhythmics such as flecainide are potent sodium channel blockers that have increased effect at faster heart rates (use-dependence).

Nitrates are converted to nitric oxide by vascular smooth muscle cells, and nitric oxide causes increased intracellular cGMP as a second-messenger.  Increased cGMP concentration leads to vascular smooth muscle relaxation.  Additionally, cGMP is metabolized within the cells by phosphodiesterase, and phosphodiesterase inhibitors will lead to increased intracellular cGMP.  cGMP accumulation in vascular smooth muscle cells due to both enhanced synthesis (nitrates) and inhibited degradation (PDE inhibitors) is responsible for profound hypotension due to extreme vasodilatation when these drugs are used together. $#(Choice A)#  Receptor downregulation or tachyphylaxis occurs with many drug classes including topical glucocorticoids, opiates, L-dopa and more.  It is one mechanism by which the body develops tolerance to drugs on a cellular level, but it is not the cause of hypotension in this patient who took nitrates together with a PDE inhibitor. $#(Choice B)#  Gs protein phosphorylation leads to activation of the Gs protein, a stimulatory protein which acts as a part of the adenylate cyclase second messenger system.  It has no role in cGMP pathways that are affected by nitrates and PDE inhibitors. $#(Choice D)#  Tyrosine kinase overactivity would lead to an exaggeration of the effects of insulin or insulin-like growth factor.  Tyrosine kinase has no role in the effect of nitrates or PDE inhibitors on vascular smooth muscle. $#(Choice E)#  Enhanced phospholipid metabolism would lead to an increase in the production of prostaglandins (via diacylglycerol) and inositol triphosphate (leading to calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum).  This is the inositol triphosphate second-messenger system, and it mediates the effects of alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, angiotensin II receptors, oxytocin receptors and vascular vasopressin receptors.  It is not involved in the action of nitrates or PDE inhibitors. $#(Choice F)#  Tolerance refers to the need for a larger dose of drug to achieve the same clinical effect achieved previously with a smaller dose of drug.  Development of tolerance can occur by multiple mechanisms such as a change in cellular response to drug (decreased receptors, decreased response to receptor stimulation), as well as increased rate of drug elimination by the body.  Tolerance is not the reason for this patient to experience hypotension with this drug combination. $#Educational objective# Using nitrates together with phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors used for erectile dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension causes a profound systemic hypotension because they both increase intracellular cGMP which causes vascular smooth muscle relaxation.  Their use together is absolutely contraindicated.  "

Nitrates must be avoided in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (due to increased outflow tract obstruction), right ventricular infarction (due to reduction in preload, impairing cardiac output), and those on phosphodiesterase inhibitors (synergism increases the risk of severe hypotension). $#(Choice A)#  Atrioventricular conduction delay is a potential adverse effect of several drugs used for management of chronic stable angina.  These include calcium channel blockers (eg, verapamil, diltiazem) and beta blockers (eg, metoprolol, propranolol). $#(Choice B)#  Cold extremities due to Raynaud phenomenon are associated with medications such as amphetamines, ergotamine, and chemotherapeutic agents. $#(Choice C)#  Constipation is a common side effect of opioid analgesics, iron supplements, calcium channel blockers such as verapamil, and anticholinergic medications such as atropine. $#(Choice D)#  Thiazide diuretics can lead to hyperuricemia and precipitate an acute gout attack. $#(Choice E)#  Nocturnal wheezing can be a symptom of asthma or gastroesophageal reflux disease.  In addition, the use of beta blockers in patients with underlying bronchospastic disease can cause increased bronchoconstriction and lead to wheezing. $#(Choice G)#  Urinary retention is typically associated with medications that exhibit anticholinergic properties such as tricyclic antidepressants (eg, amitriptyline) and antihistamines (eg, diphenhydramine). $#Educational objective# The main adverse effects seen with nitrate therapy include headaches and cutaneous flushing along with lightheadedness and hypotension due to systemic vasodilation.

  "explanation_2": "$The typical myocardial action potential of \"nonpacemaker\" or cardiac myocytes includes several phases:  $1. #Phase 0 (rapid depolarization)# – occurs when the resting membrane potential reaches threshold; it is characterized by rapid sodium entry into the cell due to activation and opening of voltage-dependent sodium channels.  Class I antiarrhythmic drugs (eg, procainamide#,# flecainide, lidocaine) block these sodium channels and inhibit the initial depolarization phase (phase 0) of the action potential.  $2. #Phase 1 (early repolarization)# – caused primarily by activation of transient outward potassium currents along with a rapid decline in inward sodium current.  This phase is not modulated to an appreciable extent by antiarrhythmic medications.  $3. #Phase 2 (plateau phase)# – Stable membrane potential due to a balance of \"late\" inward calcium current and outward potassium current.  Calcium channel blockers (verapamil, diltiazem) are class IV antiarrhythmic drugs that inhibit the L-type calcium channels during this phase.  These medications slow the sinus rate, prolong conduction through the atrioventricular node, and depress myocardial contractility (negative inotropic effect).  $4. #Phase 3 (late repolarization)# – characterized by the opening of #potassium channels# and the efflux of potassium ions from the cell (delayed rectifier potassium currents IKr and IKs) in conjunction with the decay of inward calcium current.  #Class III# antiarrhythmic drugs (#amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide#) predominantly block potassium channels and inhibit the outward potassium current during this phase, leading to prolongation of repolarization, action potential duration, and the QT interval on ECG.  These medications are often used for #maintenance of sinus rhythm# in patients with #paroxysmal atrial fibrillation#.  $5. #Phase 4 (recovery)# – normal resting membrane potential is between −80 and −95 mV and is generated by open potassium channels (inward rectifier current).  Antiarrhythmic drugs do not affect phase 4 of the myocyte action potential, but beta blockers and calcium channel blockers can slow diastolic depolarization (phases 4 and 0) in pacemaker cells by decreasing the slope of depolarization. $#Educational objective# Class III antiarrhythmic drugs (amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide) predominantly block potassium channels and inhibit the outward potassium currents during phase 3 of the cardiac action potential, thereby prolonging repolarization and total action potential duration.

The anatomic defects of @ToF@ are #RVOT obstruction# with an overriding aorta and large #ventricular septal defect# (VSD); concentric right ventricular hypertrophy develops due to increased right ventricular pressure load compared to normal. $The degree of RVOT obstruction is the major driver of symptoms in ToF because it determines how much blood flows through the pulmonary artery to the lungs and the magnitude and direction of shunting through the VSD.

In many patients, activities (eg, feeding, crying) can precipitate cyanotic episodes (tet episodes) by causing a dynamic increase in RVOT obstruction.

The little blood that reaches the lungs usually does so through a VSD, causing a relative increase in RV SaO2. $#(Choice B)#  The pattern of increased right-sided and decreased left-sided SaO2 is seen in @total anomalous pulmonary venous return@, a condition in which the pulmonary veins (ie, oxygenated blood) drain into the RA rather than the LA. $#(Choice C)#  An @ASD@ typically causes left-to-right shunting of oxygenated blood between the atria, increasing SaO2 in both the RA and RV.  In contrast to a VSD, an ASD typically causes a systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border (pulmonic flow murmur). $#(Choice E)#  Over time, increased pulmonary blood flow from left-to-right shunting via a VSD can reverse to right-to-left shunting (ie, @Eisenmenger syndrome@).  SaO2 on the right side will be normal, whereas that in the LV and systemic circulation is decreased because of mixing with deoxygenated blood from the RV.  However, Eisenmenger syndrome takes years to develop and typically presents with signs of right heart failure and cyanosis in adolescents/adults. $#Educational objective# A ventricular septal defect, classically characterized by a harsh, holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border, causes left-to-right shunting of oxygenated blood from the left ventricle to the right ventricle.  Therefore, right ventricular oxygen saturation is increased compared to normal.  ",

However, some degree of the RVOT obstruction is dynamic, and @transient increases@ in RVOT obstruction (eg, infundibular muscle spasm while feeding or crying) may force the reversal of flow (ie, right-to-left) and cause episodic cyanosis. $• Mild RVOT obstruction:  Patients with mild RVOT, which is likely the case in this boy, may have no cyanotic episodes and develop heart failure later in childhood due to pulmonary overcirculation from the high volume of left-to-right shunting via the large VSD. $#(Choices A and C)#  Although the pulmonic valve may be stenotic in patients with ToF (contributing to RVOT obstruction), the aortic and tricuspid valves are typically normal and have no stenosis or insufficiency. $#(Choice D)#  The majority of patients with ToF do not have pulmonary parenchymal or other extracardiac malformations. $#Educational objective# Tetralogy of Fallot is a congenital heart defect characterized by right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) obstruction, a large ventricular septal defect (VSD), an overriding aorta, and right ventricular hypertrophy.  The degree of RVOT obstruction is the greatest determinant of symptom severity because it regulates pulmonary arterial blood flow and the magnitude and direction of shunting through the VSD.  ",

Fibrinous/serofibrinous pericarditis is the most common type of pericarditis, and a #pericardial friction rub# (described as high pitched, leathery, and scratchy) is the most specific physical finding.  Fibrinous pericarditis may be caused by myocardial infarction, rheumatologic disease (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus), uremia, or viral infection.  This patient's history of a recent upper respiratory illness suggests a #viral etiology#. $#(Choice B)#  During inspiration, jugular venous pressure normally decreases as blood is pulled into the right side of the heart.  Kussmaul sign is a paradoxical increase in jugular venous pressure on inspiration.  It occurs because of impaired right-sided diastolic filling in conditions such as constrictive pericarditis, restrictive cardiomyopathy, and tricuspid stenosis.  Although constrictive (chronic) pericarditis can result from prolonged pericardial inflammation (over months to years), this patient's presentation is consistent with acute pericarditis, which is not associated with impaired right-sided diastolic filling. $#(Choice C)#  A pericardial knock is a brief, high-frequency, precordial sound heard in early diastole (shortly after S2) in patients with constrictive pericarditis.  It occurs earlier than S3 and may be confused with the opening snap of mitral stenosis. $#(Choice D)#  @Pulsus paradoxus@ is a drop in systolic blood pressure >10 mm Hg during inspiration.  It represents an exaggeration of the normal reduction in systolic blood pressure during inspiration.  It can be seen in cardiac tamponade, constrictive pericarditis, and severe asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. $#(Choice E)#  An S3 typically results from reverberation of the ventricular walls during rapid filling of an overfilled ventricle.  It is usually associated with heart failure as occurs with dilated cardiomyopathy, severe mitral regurgitation, or severe aortic regurgitation.  A right-sided S3 can occur with right-sided heart failure. $#Educational objective# Acute-onset, sharp, and pleuritic chest pain that decreases with leaning forward is characteristic of acute pericarditis.

  "explanation_2": "A holosystolic murmur at the apex with radiation to the axilla is consistent with #mitral regurgitation# (MR).  The murmur is generated by regurgitant blood flow from the left ventricle back to the left atrium during systole.  This results in elevated pressure and blood volume in the left atrium, which increases the amount of blood reentering the left ventricle during diastole; an #audible S3 gallop# occurs when the left ventricle is unable to accommodate the excess blood flow. $An S3 is generated by the sudden cessation of blood flow into the left ventricle during the passive filling phase of diastole.  A higher volume of blood flow or a more dilated left ventricle is more likely to produce an S3, and although an S3 can be a normal finding in healthy young adults, it is usually a pathologic finding in older adults that is classically associated with heart failure.  In patients with MR, an S3 is the best indicator of severe MR with left-sided volume overload; the #absence of an S3# can be used to #exclude severe chronic MR#. $#(Choice B)#  An S4 is a low-frequency diastolic sound that occurs during the atrial kick of ventricular diastole, and it reflects blood colliding with a stiff ventricular wall.  It often indicates pathology such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or concentric left ventricular hypertrophy (eg, due to hypertension or aortic stenosis). $#(Choice C)#  A mid-systolic click is characteristic of mitral valve prolapse.  It is caused by sudden tensing of the chordae tendineae as they are pulled taut by the valve leaflets ballooning into the left atrium.  The @timing of the click@ varies with left ventricular volume; it occurs earlier in systole with physical maneuvers that decrease left ventricular volume. $#(Choice D)#  An opening snap is an early diastolic sound heard after S2 in patients with mitral or tricuspid stenosis.  The S2-to-opening snap interval is the time between the closure of the aortic valve and the abrupt halting of leaflet motion during opening of a stenotic mitral valve; a shorter S2-to-opening snap interval is indicative of more severe mitral stenosis. $#(Choice E)#  Pulmonic valve stenosis delays pulmonic valve closure leading to widened @splitting of S2@.  The splitting is further accentuated by the increase in venous return to the right side of the heart that occurs with inspiration. $#Educational objective# Patients with severe mitral regurgitation develop left-sided volume overload with an S3 gallop due to the large volume of regurgitant flow reentering the ventricle during mid-diastole.

Over time, injected particulate material denudes the surface of the heart valves, thereby creating a variegated surface for microorganism attachment.  This dramatically increases the risk of #infective endocarditis# (IE).  The #right-sided valves# are at greatest risk because pulmonary capillaries prevent large particulate matter from reaching the left side of the heart; the #tricuspid valve# is involved in >90% of cases. $Common manifestations of tricuspid valve IE include right-sided heart failure (eg, jugular venous distension, ascites, lower extremity edema) and/or #septic pulmonary emboli# (eg, multiple pulmonary nodules on chest x-ray).  Cardiopulmonary evaluation usually reveals a blowing, holosystolic murmur heard best along the left lower sternal border that is intensified during inspiration and reduced with standing.  Crackles and rhonchi are often present (in the setting of septic emboli).  #Echocardiography# will show valvular vegetations, which frequently result in #regurgitation# due to incomplete valve closure. $#(Choices A and D)#  Aortic and mitral valve IE is less common in injection drug users than tricuspid valve IE because the pulmonary vasculature filters out particulate matter and microorganisms.  In addition, septic emboli from the left-side of the heart usually lodge in capillary beds (eg, cutaneous) prior to returning to the right-side of the heart; therefore, septic pulmonary emboli are less common. $#(Choice B)#  Aortic stenosis is common in older adults and usually causes dyspnea, angina, or syncope.  Stenosis is not typically seen in IE, and left-sided IE does not usually present with pulmonary septic emboli. $#(Choice C)#  An interventricular septal defect (VSD) can cause a left-to-right cardiac shunt, which can limit systemic blood flow and result in pulmonary hypertension.  A VSD is less likely in this patient with intravenous drug use, signs of infection, and likely septic pulmonary emboli. $#(Choice E)#  Pulmonary valve IE sometimes occurs in injection drug users; however, it generally causes pulmonary valve regurgitation (not stenosis) due to incomplete valvular closure.  Patients with pulmonary stenosis often have signs of right-sided heart failure (eg, edema, ascites, elevated jugular venous distension) or dyspnea. $#Educational objective# Patients who inject drugs are at high risk for infective endocarditis (IE) due to the concurrent injection of abrasive particulate material and microorganisms.  Most cases arise on the tricuspid valve.  Patients with tricuspid valve IE often present with right-sided heart failure or septic pulmonary emboli.

One potential cause is #persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn# (PPHN), in which pulmonary vascular resistance fails to decline immediately after birth.  Flow of deoxygenated blood from the pulmonary artery to the aorta through the ductus arteriosus results in decreased postductal oxygen saturation (eg, in the lower extremities) relative to preductal oxygen saturation (eg, in the upper extremities). $With most #right-to-left shunts#, the pressure gradient across the shunt is low; therefore, the shunt itself #rarely creates a murmur# (in contrast to the continuous murmur heard with left-to-right shunting through a PDA).

This patient's strong femoral pulses are also consistent with PPHN (other causes of right-to-left shunting through the ductus arteriosus [eg, critical aortic coarctation] are associated with diminished femoral pulses). $PPHN is often triggered by a pulmonary disorder (eg, lung hypoplasia, meconium aspiration, pneumonia), which can cause respiratory distress (eg, subcostal retractions, grunting) and can also contribute to hypoxemia and cyanosis. $#(Choices A, B, and C)#  A left-to-right shunt involves passage of oxygenated blood from the systemic circulation into the pulmonary circulation.  It does not result in deoxygenated blood reaching the systemic circulation; therefore, hypoxemia and cyanosis do not occur. $#(Choice D)#  Patients with PPHN may also experience right-to-left shunting through an atrial septal defect (if present) or the foramen ovale.  However, right-to-left shunting through these intracardiac pathways would not cause differential cyanosis (ie, deoxygenated blood would reach both the upper body and the lower body). $#Educational objective# Differential cyanosis (cyanosis affecting only the lower body) suggests right-to-left shunting across the ductus arteriosus.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient's exertional dyspnea, orthopnea (dyspnea when lying flat), jugular venous distension, cardiac heave, and peripheral edema are consistent with #decompensated heart failure#.  The decreased cardiac output in heart failure reduces renal perfusion, which stimulates #renin secretion# by the @juxtaglomerular cells@ of the kidney #(choice H)# in a maladaptive effort to maintain effective blood volume and organ perfusion. $Renin acts to convert angiotensinogen (produced by the liver) into angiotensin I in the systemic circulation #(choices B and E)#.  Angiotensin I is then converted to #angiotensin II#, primarily within the #small pulmonary vessels#, by endothelial-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme.  Because of the pulmonary location of angiotensin conversion, levels of angiotensin II are #higher in the pulmonary vein# (on the way out of the lungs) than in the pulmonary artery (on the way into the lungs). $Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor of the systemic circulation and causes a rise in blood pressure (increased afterload) that worsens cardiac output.  It also acts on the adrenal glands to stimulate aldosterone release, causing sodium retention and further worsening of volume overload #(choice A).# $#(Choice D)#  The angiotensinases are a group of enzymes found in multiple tissues and are responsible for the breakdown of angiotensin II and other structurally similar enzymes. $#(Choice F)#  Arginine vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone) is released from the posterior pituitary in response to high serum osmolality or decreased arterial blood volume.  Because reduced cardiac output causes the body to perceive hypovolemia, antidiuretic hormone secretion is typically increased in heart failure. $#(Choice G)#  Prostaglandins are produced in multiple cell types, including endothelial cells, mast cells, and macrophages.  Prostaglandin E1 is a potent vasodilator that maintains patency of the ductus arteriosus and causes afferent arteriolar vasodilation in the kidneys. $#Educational objective# The reduced cardiac output in heart failure leads to decreased renal perfusion and consequent stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in a maladaptive effort to maintain effective blood volume.  Inactive angiotensin I is converted into active angiotensin II by endothelial-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme in the lungs.  ",

This patient with a transient wall motion defect localized to the cardiac apex most likely has a fixed atherosclerotic lesion that limits blood flow to that area of myocardium. $#(Choice A)#  Coronary artery occlusion due to plaque rupture and thrombosis leads to acute myocardial infarction (MI).

Therefore, the normal response to dobutamine infusion is a transient increase in ejection fraction. $#Educational objective# Stable angina results from fixed coronary artery stenosis that limits blood flow to downstream myocardium, preventing the myocardial oxygen supply from increasing during exertion.

  "explanation_2": "$On auscultation, the best indicator of mitral stenosis (MS) severity is the length of time between S2 (specifically the A2 component, caused by aortic valve closure) and the opening snap (OS).  The OS occurs due to abrupt tensing of the valve leaflets as the mitral valve reaches its maximum diameter during forceful opening.  As MS worsens, left atrial pressures increase due to impaired movement of blood into the left ventricle.  Higher pressure causes the valve to open more forcefully; as a result, the A2-OS interval becomes shorter as left atrial pressure increases.  The current standard for diagnosis and determination of MS severity is measurement of mean transvalvular pressure gradients via 2-D Doppler echocardiography. $#(Choices B and C)#  Left-sided S3 and/or S4 gallops are generally absent in MS, since left ventricular filling is normal or decreased.  When MS is severe enough to produce pulmonary hypertension, patients may develop right-sided heart failure.  As a result, a right-sided S3 and/or S4 can occur.  However, these right-sided gallops arise only in severe, end-stage MS and are not useful for differentiating between mild and moderate MS. $#(Choice D)#  Diastolic rumble intensity in MS does not correlate well with stenosis severity.  This is due to murmur intensity being dependent on both the transvalvular pressure gradient and the amount of blood flowing through the valve.  In very severe stenosis, the diastolic murmur may be completely absent due to greatly reduced flow across the valve. $#(Choice E)#  Presystolic accentuation of the MS murmur occurs due to increased transvalvular flow associated with left atrial contraction.  This accentuation is heard across a wide range of MS severity.  More significant than the degree of presystolic accentuation is its presence or absence.  When MS becomes severe enough to precipitate atrial fibrillation, presystolic accentuation of the MS murmur disappears. $#Educational objective# The best and most reliable auscultatory indicator of the degree of mitral stenosis is the A2-OS interval.  A shorter interval indicates more severe stenosis.  Other auscultatory findings can include a diastolic rumbling murmur with presystolic accentuation due to left-atrial contraction.  "

  "explanation_2": "This patient is agitated and restless and has #dilated pupils#, tachycardia, and hypertension, suggesting #increased sympathetic activity# from #cocaine intoxication#.  Cocaine use commonly leads to adverse cardiovascular effects that result from inhibition of the presynaptic reuptake of norepinephrine. $#Overstimulation of adrenergic receptors# (eg, alpha-1, beta-1) causes an increase in heart rate, blood pressure, and myocardial contractility, leading to an increase in myocardial oxygen demand.  Arterial vasoconstriction, including #coronary vasoconstriction#, is also enhanced (alpha-1 effect), leading to a decrease in myocardial oxygen supply.  This myocardial oxygen supply-demand mismatch often causes #myocardial ischemia#, evidenced in this patient by retrosternal chest pain and ST-segment depression on ECG.  Peripheral vasoconstriction may also impair heat loss, causing #low-grade fever#. $Patients with suspected cocaine-induced chest pain are frequently treated with #nitroglycerin# (reduces cardiac preload) and #benzodiazepines# (reduces sympathetic outflow to alleviate tachycardia/hypertension) in order to #improve myocardial ischemia#.  Benzodiazepines also calm cocaine-induced psychomotor agitation, which helps further decrease myocardial oxygen demand. $#(Choice A)#  Acute pericarditis causes sharp, pleuritic chest pain and sometimes fever and may lead to widespread ST-segment elevation (but not depression) on ECG.  The chest pain typically requires anti-inflammatory medication (eg, ibuprofen) to resolve. $#(Choice B)#  Acute aortic dissection commonly presents with abrupt-onset, tearing chest pain in the setting of hypertension, and cocaine use increases the risk.  However, a widened mediastinum is expected on chest x-ray, and blood pressure asymmetry is often present in the upper extremities.  In addition, the chest pain is unlikely to resolve without pain medication. $#(Choice C)#  Coronary artery thrombosis causes myocardial infarction associated with atherosclerotic plaque rupture, which is unlikely in this relatively young patient.  Cocaine use rarely causes coronary artery thrombosis; associated chest pain is usually from myocardial ischemia due to myocardial oxygen supply-demand mismatch. $#(Choice E)#  Acute pulmonary embolism may cause pulmonary infarction, leading to pleuritic chest pain.  An associated pleural effusion is usually expected on chest x-ray, and the pain is unlikely to resolve without pain medication. $#Educational objective# Cocaine intoxication causes increased sympathetic activity, which may be recognized by agitation, dilated pupils, tachycardia, and hypertension.  Cocaine-induced chest pain typically results from myocardial oxygen supply-demand mismatch (ie, myocardial ischemia) in the setting of coronary artery vasoconstriction.

In comparison to @normal tracings@, hemodynamic tracings in patients with mitral stenosis typically reveal an elevated pressure gradient between the left atrial and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. $Classic physical examination findings include a loud first heart sound (S1), an early diastolic high-frequency #opening snap# after the second heart sound (S2), and a low-pitched #diastolic rumble#.  These findings are best heard at the #cardiac apex# using the bell of the stethoscope with the patient lying on the left side in held expiration. $Left ventricular pressure falls rapidly during isovolumetric relaxation.  The opening snap is caused by the sudden opening of the mitral valve leaflets when the left ventricular diastolic pressure falls below the left atrial pressure at the beginning of diastole.  As mitral stenosis becomes more severe, the opening snap occurs earlier after S2. $#(Choice A)#  This point corresponds to the opening of the aortic valve at the end of isovolumetric ventricular contraction in early systole when the left ventricular pressure exceeds the central aortic pressure.  This correlates with the timing of an aortic ejection murmur that may be heard in patients with aortic stenosis (eg, due to a calcified bicuspid aortic valve). $#(Choice B)#  This point corresponds to the closure of the aortic valve at the end of systole, producing the aortic component of S2.  The aortic valve closes as soon as left ventricular pressure drops below the aortic pressure. $#(Choice D)#  This is a random point in diastole when the mitral valve is already maximally open and there is passive filling of the left ventricular cavity (diastasis).  In patients with mitral stenosis, the elevated pressure gradient between the left atrium and left ventricle during diastole causes the mid-diastolic rumble. $#(Choice E)#  This point roughly corresponds to the onset of atrial contraction during late ventricular diastole.

In this case, the presence of jugular venous distension and lower extremity edema shortly after pulmonary embolism (PE) are highly suggestive of #right-sided heart failure (RHF)# (ie, cor pulmonale) as the cause of this patient's ascites. $Patients with chronic respiratory disorders (eg, #emphysema#, obstructive sleep apnea) often have #baseline pulmonary hypertension# due to hypoxia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction and associated vascular remodelling, which increases the pressure that the right ventricle (RV) must work against to maintain forward flow.  These patients are #predisposed to RHF#, which can develop subacutely from progressive pulmonary hypertension or #acutely #in the setting of a PE (due to abrupt obstruction of an already compromised pulmonary capillary bed). $Ascites due to RHF is associated with the following findings: $• #Increased hydrostatic pressure:# RV dysfunction results in the backup of blood within the venous circulation, leading to increased central venous pressure, which is transmitted to the portal capillaries (ie, hepatic sinusoids). $ $• #Normal oncotic pressure:# Although passive congestion from prolonged RHF eventually causes sinusoidal injury, leading to cirrhosis and hepatic synthetic dysfunction (ie hypoalbuminemia), this alteration occurs after a prolonged period (weeks).  Albumin has a half-life of approximately 21 days; therefore, early in the disease process, oncotic pressure remains normal #(choice B).# $• #Normal capillary permeability:# Hepatic congestion is characterized by sinusoidal engorgement, but sinusoidal permeability, which is already high at baseline due to the discontinuous sinusoidal endothelium, remains essentially unchanged. $#(Choices A, D, and F)#  Portal capillary permeability may be increased in the setting of hepatic malignancies due to disruption of portal capillary integrity; however, it is unaffected by RHF.  Portal oncotic pressure remains normal early in the disease process. $#(Choice C)#  Both increased portal capillary oncotic pressure and decreased portal capillary hydrostatic pressure would help resolve ascites rather than contribute to its formation. $#Educational objective# Right-sided heart failure promotes the formation of ascites due to increased central venous pressure, which is transmitted to the hepatic sinusoids, leading to increased capillary hydrostatic pressure.  Capillary permeability is unaffected.

This is most likely due to the patient's recent viral illness causing viral pericarditis with significant pericardial fluid accumulation.  Normally there is a <10 mm Hg decrease in systolic blood pressure during inspiration.  @Pulsus paradoxus@ refers to an abnormal exaggerated decrease in systolic blood pressure >10 mm Hg on inspiration, a common finding in patients with large pericardial effusions causing tamponade. $Inspiration causes an increase in systemic venous return, resulting in increased right heart volumes.  Under normal conditions, this results in expansion of the right ventricle into the pericardial space with little impact on the left side of the heart.  However, in conditions that impair expansion into the pericardial space (eg, cardiac tamponade), the increased right ventricular volume that occurs with inspiration leads to bowing of the interventricular septum toward the left ventricle.  This leads to a decrease in left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic volume and forward stroke volume, with a resultant decrease in systolic pressure during inspiration. $#(Choice A)#  Acute myocardial infarction typically presents with sudden onset of substernal discomfort, diaphoresis, and/or dyspnea, and can progress to cardiogenic shock (hypotension, tachycardia, jugular venous distension, and pulmonary edema).  Patients can have weak or undetectable peripheral pulses; however, pulsus paradoxus is typically not seen. $#(Choice B)#  Acute viral myocarditis can lead to severe LV systolic dysfunction and present with acute congestive heart failure and cardiogenic shock.  Patients with severe LV failure can have pulsus alternans - a variation in pulse amplitude with alternate beats.  Pulsus paradoxus is typically not seen in such patients. $#(Choice D)#  Pulsus paradoxus can also occur in patients with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and (less frequently) constrictive pericarditis.  Constrictive pericarditis is caused by scarring and loss of elasticity of the normal pericardial sac; it takes several weeks to months to develop and only rarely occurs after recurrent episodes of acute pericarditis. $#(Choice E)#  The initial stage of septic shock is a hyperdynamic circulatory state with lowered systemic vascular resistance and increased cardiac output (warm shock).  Weak pulses and pulsus paradoxus would not be expected in such patients. $#(Choice F)#  In tension pneumothorax, breath sounds are typically absent on the affected side with hyperresonance to percussion.  Other features of tension pneumothorax include tachypnea, tachycardia, hypotension, distended neck veins, and tracheal deviation to the contralateral side. $#Educational objective# Cardiac tamponade typically presents with hypotension with pulsus paradoxus, elevated jugular venous pressure, and muffled heart sounds (Beck's triad).

  "explanation_2": "$This patient with chronic hypertension has hypertensive urgency.  He received hydralazine, a fast-acting antihypertensive agent.  After abrupt normalization of blood pressure (BP), he developed acute tubular necrosis (ATN) (granular casts).  This sequence of events is consistent with #normotensive ischemia# (ie, inadequate renal perfusion despite a normal BP). $#Blood flow autoregulation# allows organs to receive the same perfusion (flow) across a wide range of pressure.  In the kidneys, blood flow autoregulation involves 2 key mechanisms: $• #Myogenic response:#  Afferent glomerular arterioles reflexively constrict when they sense greater stretch forces (high BP). $• #Tubuloglomerular feedback:#  High arterial pressure causes hyperfiltration (↑ glomerular filtration rate), increasing sodium and chloride delivery to the macula densa, which secretes vasoactive mediators (eg, adenosine) to constrict the afferent arterioles $The autoregulation response protects organs from dangerous, persistent BP elevations.  In #chronic hypertension#, there is #baseline constriction# of afferent glomerular arterioles.  This causes the entire renal autoregulation curve to be #shifted to the right#: a hypertensive patient's kidneys #receive less blood flow at any given BP# relative to those of a healthy patient without hypertension.  Quickly lowering the BP to normal (eg, 145/95 mm Hg) causes a steep drop in blood flow, leading to ischemic ATN; as a result, BP should be lowered gently, targeting above-normal values (eg, 25% reduction over several hours). $#(Choice B)#  Drug-induced lupus, a rare adverse effect of hydralazine, causes acute kidney injury (AKI) due to immune complex–mediated glomerulonephritis.  However, an active urine sediment (eg, red cells, white cells, casts) and other systemic signs of lupus (eg, rash, pleuritis) would be expected. $#(Choice C)#  Drug-induced allergic interstitial nephritis is an eosinophilic AKI usually triggered by beta-lactam antibiotics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.  It occurs after continual exposure (eg, several days), and eosinophiluria is usually present. $#(Choice D)#  Some drugs (eg, acyclovir, indinavir) can precipitate in the urine, causing AKI due to crystalluria.  Urine sediment may show tubular necrosis (eg, granular casts), but crystals are usually also seen. $#(Choice E)#  Decreased cardiac output can cause prerenal AKI, which may evolve to ischemic ATN.  However, treatment with hydralazine lowers the systemic vascular resistance, which reduces cardiac afterload.  This will lead to an increase in overall cardiac output. $#Educational objective# In patients with long-standing hypertension, a chronic autoregulatory shift in the blood pressure–flow relationship occurs, affording less perfusion (flow) at any given pressure.  Therefore, excessively rapid correction of blood pressure toward normal may induce relative ischemia.  "

DA patency is maintained by circulating prostaglandin released by the placenta; after birth, prostaglandin production stops, and the #DA starts closing#. $In severe TOF, critical pulmonary stenosis or atresia limits blood flow from the right side of the heart to the pulmonary circulation for oxygenation.

In acute MR, the left atrium (LA) is of normal size and compliance and is suddenly exposed to a large volume of regurgitant blood from the left ventricle (LV).  This leads to very high LA pressures and subsequent #pulmonary edema#. $In addition, because the LV must accommodate the regurgitant blood volume along with normal pulmonary venous return, there is #increased LV end-diastolic volume# (preload).  Meanwhile, the incompetent mitral valve forms a low-resistance regurgitant pathway for blood to flow into the LA during ventricular systole, #decreasing LV afterload#.  The decreased afterload leads to #increased LV ejection fraction# (via increased @stroke volume@); however, much of the stroke volume is lost to regurgitation into the LA, resulting in overall decreased forward stroke volume and reduced cardiac output (manifesting as #hypotension# and cardiogenic shock). $In chronic MR, compensatory LA enlargement allows the LA to receive the regurgitant volume at lower filling pressures, preventing pulmonary edema from developing.  Chronic volume overload also causes the LV to undergo substantial enlargement due to @eccentric hypertrophy@.  Early on, the larger ventricular volume helps maintain forward stroke volume even in the setting of substantial regurgitant flow.  However, with prolonged hemodynamic overload, progressive eccentric remodeling of the LV becomes maladaptive, resulting in an overwhelming increase in wall stress with eventual contractile dysfunction.  The impaired contractility culminates in decompensation of chronic MR with reduced forward stroke volume (decreased cardiac output) and increased left-sided filling pressures (pulmonary edema). $#Educational objective# Regurgitant flow into the left atrium in acute mitral regurgitation leads to increased left atrial pressure and increased left ventricular end-diastolic volume (preload).  The low-resistance regurgitant pathway also decreases left ventricular afterload with a resulting increase in ejection fraction but overall decrease in forward stroke volume.  Increased left atrial pressure and decreased cardiac output result in pulmonary edema and severe hypotension, respectively.  ",

The risk is 2%-3% and rises with age due to increasingly turbulent blood flow across the abnormal valve. $#(Choice E)#  In early childhood, isolated bicuspid aortic valves usually are asymptomatic, without any hemodynamically significant degree of aortic outflow tract obstruction or murmurs.  In contrast, congenital aortic stenosis usually produces a systolic murmur as a result of severe subvalvular, valvular, or supravalvular anatomic defects. $#(Choice F)#  The most common cause of ventricular fibrillation at age <30 is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Incomplete closure of the aortic valve during diastole allows a portion of left ventricular stroke volume to leak back into the left ventricle; in severe AR this regurgitant flow volume may be up to 50% of total forward stroke volume.  Left ventricular dilation caused by the increase in left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) (#volume overload#) triggers @eccentric hypertrophy@, which involves ventricular wall lengthening due to the addition of myocardial contractile fibrils organized in series.  This compensatory response causes an #increase in stroke volume# that is able to maintain cardiac output, and allows for a relatively long asymptomatic period (eg, several years) in most patients with chronic AR. $However, the compensatory eccentric hypertrophy in chronic AR is overall #maladaptive#.  Over time, progressive left ventricular dilation leads to overwhelming wall stress with decreased stroke volume and eventual left ventricular failure. $#(Choice A)#  Concentric hypertrophy occurs due to conditions that create ventricular pressure overload (eg, hypertension, aortic stenosis); it involves ventricular wall thickening due to the addition of myocardial contractile fibrils in parallel.  Although some concentric hypertrophy may occur in AR, eccentric hypertrophy due to volume overload is the predominant change. $#(Choice B)#  In AR, left ventricular preload or LVEDV is increased, rather than decreased.  This helps the ventricle maintain cardiac output via the Frank-Starling mechanism.  Decreased preload would cause a reduction in cardiac output. $#(Choice C)#  Increased aortic elasticity (ie, decreased compliance or increased aortic stiffening) occurs with aging and results in higher systolic blood pressure, widened pulse pressure, and reduced cardiac output. $#(Choice D)#  In chronic AR, there is an effective increase in left ventricular afterload due to the enlarged chamber size (increases wall stress) and high peak systolic pressures.  This increases left ventricular work, making it more difficult to maintain cardiac output and eventually leads to heart failure. $#(Choice F)#  Because cardiac output is maintained by an increase in stroke volume, there is typically minimal increase in heart rate in chronic AR.  However, in acute AR, eccentric hypertrophy does not have time to develop and the capacity to increase stroke volume is limited.  The resulting decrease in cardiac output triggers a reflexive increase in heart rate, but this response is typically insufficient and most patients develop severe cardiogenic shock with pulmonary edema. $#Educational objective# In chronic aortic regurgitation, persistent left ventricular volume overload triggers eccentric hypertrophy, which causes a compensatory increase in stroke volume to maintain cardiac output.  This compensatory mechanism allows for a relatively long asymptomatic period in most patients; however, left ventricular dysfunction eventually occurs, leading to heart failure.  ",

  "explanation_2": "$This patient's echocardiography reveals a reduced left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (<50%) in the absence of heart failure symptoms, a condition known as #asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction#.  An early asymptomatic period is common in the progression of heart failure; it occurs in part due to @compensatory eccentric hypertrophy@ in response to LV volume overload.  In addition, #neurohormonal mechanisms# help maintain cardiac output and organ perfusion in the setting of declining cardiac function. $Early in the course of heart failure, small reductions in cardiac output lead to decreased stretch of aortic and carotid baroreceptors with consequent #sympathetic nervous system activation# (increased norepinephrine) to stimulate vasoconstriction, increased heart rate, and increased cardiac contractility.  In addition, decreased renal perfusion stimulates the juxtaglomerular apparatus to increase renin secretion and activate the #renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system# (RAAS), leading to vasoconstriction via increased angiotensin II levels and salt and water retention via increased aldosterone levels.  The volume retention (increased preload) and vasoconstriction (increased afterload) help maintain cardiac output and organ perfusion in the short term; however, the #long-term effects# are #deleterious# because increased hemodynamic stress and neurohormonal-induced cardiac remodeling eventually lead to #decompensated heart failure#. $Atrial and ventricular myocardial stretch triggers #increased atrial and brain natriuretic peptide# secretion through separate neurohormonal pathways.  These peptides stimulate vasodilation and salt and water excretion, counteracting the effects of the sympathetic nervous system and RAAS; however, the natriuretic pathways are eventually overwhelmed by the downward compensatory spiral. $#Educational objective# Asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction is a common stage in the progression of heart failure.  Neurohormonal mechanisms, including the sympathetic nervous system and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, help maintain the asymptomatic period by increasing volume retention and peripheral resistance to maintain organ perfusion.  Although these mechanisms are beneficial in the short term, they are ultimately deleterious, increasing hemodynamic stress and cardiac remodeling that eventually lead to decompensated heart failure.

Both etiologies eventually lead to #decreased cardiac output# and inadequate oxygen delivery to the tissues, inducing the following #neuroendocrine compensatory mechanisms# in an effort to restore organ perfusion: $• #Increased sympathetic output#:  Baroreceptors sense decreased perfusion and stimulate epinephrine and norepinephrine release to increase heart rate and contractility.

Adrenal secretion of aldosterone also increases, which stimulates sodium and water retention and increases circulating blood volume (preload). $Although these compensatory mechanisms initially improve organ perfusion, they are overall #maladaptive#.  A vicious cycle is generated as the failing heart is unable to pump against increased afterload, and volume retention creates venous congestion in the kidneys that reduces glomerular filtration rate and further impairs diuresis.  Atrial and ventricular stretch triggers the release of natriuretic peptides that stimulate vasodilation and fluid diuresis to counteract the vicious cycle; however, these effects are outweighed by the downward-spiraling negative effects of sympathetic drive and RAAS activation. $#(Choice B)#  Left ventricular failure leads to increased pulmonary venous pressure and transudation of fluid into the lung parenchyma, which stiffens the alveolar walls and decreases lung compliance. $#(Choice C)#  With reduced cardiac output, the tissues become starved for O2 and increase O2 extraction from the available capillary blood.  This leads to a reduction in mixed venous O2 content. $#(Choice E)#  Stroke volume is generally maintained early in heart failure (due to compensatory mechanisms) and decreases as decompensation takes place. $#Educational objective# Decreased cardiac output in heart failure triggers neuroendocrine compensatory mechanisms to maintain organ perfusion; however, the compensatory mechanisms are maladaptive over the long term.  Increased sympathetic output and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system stimulate vasoconstriction and volume retention, compounding the hemodynamic stress on an already failing heart and creating a vicious cycle of decompensation.

Left atrial pressure gradually increases to approximately 10 mm Hg in the normal heart with a characteristic \"V wave\" created at the end of passive filling.  However, in the setting of MR, an incompetent mitral valve allows backflow of blood from the left ventricle during ventricular systole, leading to markedly #elevated left atrial pressure# during this time.

Over time, decompensated heart failure, evidenced by dyspnea and orthopnea in this patient, can also occur. $#(Choice A)#  In @aortic regurgitation@, backflow of blood from the aorta into the left ventricle during diastole results in rapid loss of aortic pressure and elevated LV end-diastolic volume with a compensatory increase in LV stroke volume.  Pressure tracings show loss of the aortic dicrotic notch (normally seen around aortic valve closure), rapid decline of aortic pressure during diastole, and elevated peak LV and aortic systolic pressures.  There is also early closure of the mitral valve due to elevated LV diastolic pressure. $#(Choice B)#  @Aortic stenosis@ causes obstruction of LV outflow resulting in discordance of LV and aortic systolic pressure.  Pressure tracings characteristically show peak LV systolic pressure significantly higher than aortic systolic pressure. $#(Choice D)#  @Mitral stenosis@ causes elevated left atrial pressures throughout the cardiac cycle with peak atrial pressure occurring at the time of atrial kick, just before the mitral valve closes at the end of ventricular diastole. $#(Choice E)#  Tricuspid regurgitation causes an early and large V wave on right atrial pressure tracing, similar to that seen on left atrial pressure tracing in the setting of MR.  Left-sided pressure tracings (left atrial, left ventricular, aortic) are minimally affected in tricuspid regurgitation. $#Educational objective# Left ventricular systole corresponds to the time of passive filling of the left atrium (atrial diastole).  Mitral valve regurgitation leads to markedly elevated left atrial pressure during this period, creating the characteristic early and large V wave on left atrial pressure tracing.  ",

  "explanation_2": "$This patient's sudden-onset heart failure was most likely precipitated by acute #atrial fibrillation#, a condition that occurs in up to 10% of patients with #severe aortic stenosis# (AS).  Patients with severe AS already have reduced cardiac output due to significant valvular obstruction, which can be exacerbated by the sudden #loss of normal atrial contraction# that contributes to ventricular filling.  Atrial contraction is especially important for these patients as many have concentric left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and therefore reduced LV compliance.  As a result, they become dependent on atrial contraction to maintain adequate LV filling.  Without atrial contraction, LV preload can decrease to the point of producing severe #hypotension#.  In addition, loss of the atrial kick can result in significantly increased mean pulmonary venous pressure due to buildup of blood in the left atrium and pulmonary veins, leading to #acute pulmonary edema#.  As a result, cardioversion is indicated for acute atrial fibrillation in patients with severe AS. $#(Choice A)#  Cardiogenic pulmonary edema is characteristic of left, not right, heart failure.  When the forward pumping function of the left heart is impaired, pressure can build up in the left atrium.  This rise in pressure is transmitted to the pulmonary veins and capillaries, resulting in increased fluid transudation into the alveoli and pulmonary interstitium. $#(Choices C and E)#  This patient has no evidence of myocardial ischemia on electrocardiogram, meaning that LV systolic function is most likely unchanged.  Under these circumstances, an increase in LV filling (preload) would increase cardiac output and mean arterial pressure due to the Frank-Starling mechanism.  This patient's decreased cardiac output is most likely due to decreased LV preload. $#(Choice D)#  In a patient with AS, LV afterload is determined by the mean systolic blood pressure and the degree of transvalvular obstruction.  In degenerative calcific AS and most other forms of adult AS, the transvalvular obstruction gradually increases over years to decades, making an acute increase in LV afterload unlikely.  In addition, this patient's acute hypotension would actually cause a reduction in afterload. $#Educational objective# In patients with chronic aortic stenosis and concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, atrial contraction contributes significantly to left ventricular filling.  Loss of atrial contraction due to atrial fibrillation can reduce left ventricular preload and cardiac output sufficiently to cause systemic hypotension.  Decreased forward filling of the left ventricle can also result in backup of blood in the left atrium and pulmonary veins, leading to acute pulmonary edema.  "

Tamponade classically presents with #Beck's triad# of hypotension (often less prominent with subacute compared to acute tamponade), distant heart sounds, and jugular venous distension. $Normally, a pressure gradient exists between the vena cava and the right side of the heart, allowing blood to fill the right atrium during diastole.  With inspiration, a reduction in intrathoracic pressure pulls additional blood into the right side of the heart and the pulmonary circulation, causing normal inspiratory collapse of the inferior vena cava (IVC). $With cardiac tamponade, increasing pericardial pressure begins to compress the relatively low-pressure, #right-sided heart chambers# and #restrict diastolic filling#.  The increased right-sided pressures are transmitted backward to the vena cava, causing #engorgement of the IVC# with decreased inspiratory collapse that can be seen on echocardiography.  In addition, because the right ventricle is compressed and unable to expand during diastole, the increase in right-sided blood flow during inspiration causes the ventricular septum to bow into the left ventricle; this reduces left ventricular stroke volume during inspiration and is responsible for the observed >10 mm Hg drop in systolic blood pressure. $As tamponade progresses, impaired right-sided filling causes the left ventricle to receive less blood, resulting in decreased cardiac output and #obstructive shock#.  Because the obstruction to blood flow is primarily right sided, there is no pulmonary edema and the lungs remain clear to auscultation. $#(Choices A, B, D, and E)#  A segmental (eg, apical) wall motion abnormality suggests myocardial ischemia or infarction, dilation of all 4 cardiac chambers is seen with dilated cardiomyopathy, severe tricuspid regurgitation can occur with carcinoid syndrome, and systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve is seen with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (and often exacerbates obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract).  None of these conditions are expected to cause pulsus paradoxus or distant heart sounds. $#Educational objective# Cardiac tamponade involves restriction of diastolic filling of the right-sided heart chambers, with engorgement and decreased inspiratory collapse of the inferior vena cava seen on echocardiography.

  "explanation_2": "$The major early biochemical consequence of total myocardial ischemia is cessation of aerobic glycolysis and initiation of anaerobic glycolysis.  This transition occurs within seconds and results in inadequate production of high-energy phosphates (eg, ATP and creatine phosphate) and the accumulation of deleterious metabolites, including lactate.  Although total ATP levels remain relatively normal during the first few minutes of ischemia, ATP is rapidly depleted from areas of the cell with high metabolic demand, such as the cytosol surrounding the contraction fibers and electrolyte transport pumps.  The depletion of ATP in critical cellular areas and the accumulation of toxins result in loss of contractility within about 60 seconds of total myocardial ischemia #(choice A).# $As ischemia persists, ATP levels within the affected cardiac myocytes continue to fall while lactate levels continue to rise.  When ischemia lasts less than 30 minutes, loss of contractile function is reversible.  However, on restoration of blood flow, full myocardial contractility is not immediately restored.  Instead, there is prolonged dysfunction of the myocardium (myocardial stunning), with contractility gradually returning to normal over the next several hours to days.  Increasing durations of ischemia prolong the time that the myocardium remains stunned. $Under hypoxic conditions, ATP within cardiomyocytes is degraded to ADP, AMP, and eventually adenosine.  Adenosine is able to cross the cell membrane and function as a vasodilator when coronary blood flow is insufficient to meet myocardial demand.  However, persistent ischemia can lead to depletion of massive amounts of adenosine.  After 30 minutes of total myocardial ischemia, about half of the cellular adenine stores are lost.  At this point, failure of cellular homeostasis is inevitable and ischemic injury becomes irreversible #(choice E).# $#Educational objective# Loss of cardiomyocyte contractility occurs within 60 seconds after the onset of total ischemia.

However, right-to-left shunting usually causes cyanosis (not noted in this patient), and the pressure gradient is not typically large enough to cause a murmur. $#(Choice E)#  Left-to-right flow through an ASD itself does not generate a murmur due to the low velocity of shunted blood.  The characteristic murmur of an ASD is a systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border caused by increased flow through the pulmonic valve.  However, this murmur does not have a diastolic component (ie, not continuous). $#Educational objective# After birth, pulmonary vascular resistance progressively decreases as systemic vascular resistance progressively increases.

Because head-bobbing and other characteristic findings in AR are due to increased stroke volume and high-amplitude, rapid rise-rapid fall pulsation, these findings are less prominent once impaired left ventricular contractility (and decreased stroke volume) sets in. $#(Choices B and C)#  Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, such as occurs with aortic stenosis, leads to reduced stroke volume and characteristic weak and delayed pulses (pulsus parvus et tardus).  Restriction of left ventricular filling, as occurs in mitral stenosis, also reduces stroke volume due to reduced left ventricular end-diastolic volume (reduced preload).  Clinical findings associated with high-amplitude pulsation will not be present with reduced stroke volume. $#(Choice D)#  Combined systolic and diastolic hypertension is not necessarily accompanied by widened pulse pressure; the signs of high amplitude, rapid rise-rapid fall pulsation are more characteristic of chronic AR. $#Educational objective# Chronic aortic regurgitation (AR) causes a reduction in diastolic blood pressure and a compensatory increase in left ventricular stroke volume.  These changes create a high-amplitude, rapid rise-rapid fall pulsation (ie, widened pulse pressure) and the other characteristic findings of AR (eg, head bobbing, \"pistol-shot\" femoral pulses).",

Because the degree of RVOT obstruction is dynamic (eg, can worsen during infundibular muscle spasm), patients can experience periodic episodes of worsening hypoxemia and cyanosis often triggered by feeding or crying (ie, @\"tet\" episodes@).  #Poor weight gain# is common and likely related to reduced caloric intake and/or higher metabolic needs. $In response to #chronic hypoxemia#, the body increases red blood cell (RBC) production to increase oxygen-carrying capacity.  Tissue hypoxia in the inner cortex and medulla of the kidney triggers #increased# renal production of #erythropoietin#, which then stimulates erythrocyte precursor cells in the bone marrow to produce more RBCs, resulting in an increased hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit.  This physiologic type of #secondary polycythemia# is the most common overall mechanism of polycythemia. $#(Choice A)#  Pulmonary @dead space@ refers to portions of the lung that are ventilated but not perfused.  Decreased pulmonary dead space tends to increase alveolar air exchange and would not contribute to development of hypoxemia or secondary polycythemia. $#(Choice B)#  Impaired postnatal lung expansion (eg, pulmonary hypoplasia, diaphragmatic hernia), typically causes acute hypoxemia in the immediate newborn period.  This patient's pathologic murmur makes cardiac pathology more likely. $#(Choice C)#  Decreased, not increased, renal blood flow (as in renal artery stenosis) can sometimes cause secondary polycythemia due to reduced oxygen delivery to the renal interstitium. $#(Choice D)#  Monoclonal proliferation of erythroid cells (ie, originating from a single mutant cell) is seen in polycythemia vera, a form of blood cancer that involves autonomous RBC production independent of erythropoietin.  It is the most common cause of primary polycythemia, which is usually seen in adults and often accompanied by thrombocytosis and leukocytosis (not seen in this patient).  In contrast, secondary polycythemia (ie, erythropoietin-stimulated RBC production) involves polyclonal proliferation of erythroid cells. $#Educational objective# Tetralogy of Fallot can present in infancy with episodic cyanosis and poor weight gain.

If the flow of blood to the ischemic tissue is restored in a timely manner, those cells that were reversibly injured will typically recover.  Sometimes, however, the cells within the damaged tissue will paradoxically die at an accelerated pace through apoptosis or necrosis after resumption of blood flow.  This process is termed reperfusion injury, and is thought to occur secondary to one or more of the following mechanisms: 1) oxygen free radical generation by parenchymal cells, endothelial cells, and leukocytes; 2) severe, irreversible mitochondrial damage described as \"mitochondrial permeability transition\"; 3) inflammation, which attracts circulating neutrophils that cause additional injury; and 4) activation of the complement pathway, causing cell injury and further inflammation.  When the cells within heart, brain, or skeletal muscle are injured, the enzyme creatine kinase leaks across the damaged cell membrane and into circulation (as seen in this patient). $#(Choice A)#  Cellular swelling arises secondary to changes in ion concentration and the influx of water.  This state is considered a hallmark of reversible injury, and is not directly associated with the leakage of intracellular proteins such as creatine kinase. $#(Choice C)#  Glutathione peroxidase actually reduces cellular injury by catalyzing free radical breakdown.  The presence of this enzyme is not responsible for the release of creatine kinase. $#(Choice D)#  Mitochondrial vacuolization reduces the cellular capacity for ATP generation and is associated with irreversible injury.  Creatine kinase release is not directly associated with this mitochondrial change, however. $#(Choice E)#  Nuclear shrinkage (pyknosis), fragmentation, and dissolution characterize irreversible injury of the cell.  Creatine kinase release is not directly associated with such nuclear changes, however. $#Educational objective# Reperfusion injury is thought to occur secondary to oxygen free radical generation, mitochondrial damage, and inflammation.

The impulse then continues through the His-Purkinje system to the ventricular myocardium. $SVT occurs when an impulse originates at an abnormal focus above the ventricles, most commonly a reentrant circuit within the AV node (ie, @AV nodal reentry tachycardia@).  #Heart rate# is #elevated# (usually >150/min in adults or >220/min in infants), but rhythm is usually regular.  #QRS complexes are narrow#, and #P waves# are generally #buried# within the QRS complex due to @retrograde atrial depolarization@ occurring in conjunction with anterograde ventricular depolarization. $With persistent tachycardia, #ventricular diastole shortens#, allowing less time for ventricular relaxation and filling.

  "explanation_2": "This patient with recurrent episodes of #syncope while shaving# most likely has #carotid sinus hypersensitivity# (CSH).  When @carotid sinus baroreceptors@ detect increased blood pressure, the brainstem responds by increasing parasympathetic tone (slows the heart rate) and reducing sympathetic tone (induces vasodilation).  In some individuals, especially #elderly men#, the carotid sinus baroreceptors become #overly sensitive to tactile stimulation#, triggering an #exaggerated vasovagal response# with marked peripheral vasodilation (ie, #decreased systemic vascular resistance#).  This can cause a transient reduction in cerebral perfusion that manifests as presyncope (eg, faintness, lightheadedness) or syncope.  As with other etiologies of syncope, cerebral perfusion quickly returns and symptoms resolve within 1-2 minutes. $In addition to shaving, rubbing of a shirt collar while dressing or turning the head is another common cause of syncope due to CSH. $#(Choices A and E)#  Cardiac tachyarrhythmias are a serious cause of syncope due to reduced cardiac output and loss of cerebral perfusion.  Spontaneous resolution of the arrhythmia within 1-2 minutes allows for return of cerebral perfusion (if spontaneous resolution does not occur, the arrhythmia may cause sudden death rather than syncope).  Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia rarely causes syncope as it usually affects young patients who can tolerate rapid heart rates.  Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (torsade de pointes) typically results from delayed ventricular repolarization (ie, congenital or medication-induced QT interval prolongation) and can cause syncope in patients of any age.  Syncope due to tachyarrhythmia usually occurs suddenly with no warning symptoms (eg, faintness, lightheadedness) other than sometimes palpitations. $#(Choice C)#  Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) obstructs pulmonary blood flow and increases pulmonary vascular resistance.  Some cases of acute PE present with syncope, but acute PE is unlikely to explain recurrent episodes of syncope.  In addition, chronic pulmonary hypertension typically presents with exertional symptoms. $#(Choice D)#  The exaggerated vagal response in reflex syncope causes transient sinus bradycardia, PR interval prolongation, and atrioventricular (AV) node conduction block, whereas syncope due to age-related degeneration of the AV node usually involves sustained and advanced AV block (eg, third-degree, Mobitz type II second-degree).  This patient's recurrent episodes during shaving make reflex syncope due to CSH more likely. $#Educational objective# Carotid sinus hypersensitivity is a common cause of syncope associated with tactile stimulation of the carotid sinus (eg, shaving).  The syncope results from an exaggerated vagal response stimulated by the carotid baroreceptors, which leads to slowed heart rate and marked peripheral vasodilation with a resulting transient loss of cerebral perfusion.

The major @defects@ in ToF are right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) obstruction and ventricular septal defect (VSD); the murmur is created by blood flow through the narrowed RVOT, not the VSD. $The degree of RVOT obstruction is the primary driver of symptoms in ToF because it determines the direction and magnitude of shunting through the VSD.  A certain degree of RVOT obstruction is fixed, but some degree is dynamic and can change based on activity (eg, feeding, squatting) that alters the underlying hemodynamics.

Chronic hypoxia in COPD can lead to pulmonary vasoconstriction, increased pulmonary artery pressure, and right heart failure (ie, cor pulmonale), which is confirmed by this patient's echocardiogram.  In turn, right heart failure leads to increased central venous pressure and elevated peripheral capillary hydrostatic pressure, encouraging the development of #peripheral edema#. $Fluid movement across the capillary wall (#filtration#) into the interstitium is dependent on hydrostatic pressure, oncotic pressure, and capillary permeability.  It is tightly #balanced by lymphatic drainage#, which returns interstitial fluid to the vasculature.  Peripheral edema (accumulation of excess fluid in the interstitial space) develops when transcapillary plasma filtration exceeds the resorptive capacity of the lymphatics.  Factors that favor development of edema include: $• #Elevated capillary hydrostatic pressure:#  Higher capillary pressures increase plasma filtration into the interstitium, particularly in dependent tissues.  Causes include sodium and water retention (eg, heart failure, renal failure), arteriolar dilation (eg, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers), and impaired venous return (eg, venous thrombosis). $• #Decreased plasma oncotic pressure:#  Plasma proteins (eg, albumin) generate oncotic pressure that pulls interstitial fluid back into the capillary bed venules.  Edema develops in conditions with decreased albumin levels (eg, nephrotic syndrome, cirrhosis, malnutrition). $• #Lymphatic obstruction:#  Decreased lymphatic return impairs removal of excess interstitial fluid.  Common causes of lymphatic obstruction include filariasis, invasive malignancies, and iatrogenic etiologies (eg, surgical lymph node dissection and radiation therapy). $The peripheral lymphatics can significantly increase lymphatic drainage from baseline, allowing compensation for increased capillary fluid filtration that can #temporarily delay# the development of peripheral edema.  However, because the peripheral lymphatics offload fluid to the central venous system (via the thoracic duct), which in heart failure is already volume overloaded, the overall ability to compensate is limited. $#(Choices A and D)#  Although increased plasma oncotic pressure and decreased capillary permeability oppose edema formation, neither is associated with COPD.  Severe COPD may cause polycythemia due to hypoxemia, but erythrocyte concentration does not affect plasma oncotic pressure. $#(Choice B)#  In patients with heart failure, activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) leads to increased aldosterone levels that cause sodium and water retention (exacerbating edema formation).  Volume expansion causes increased atrial/brain natriuretic peptide release, which can partially counteract the effects of RAAS activation; however, aldosterone levels remain elevated. $#(Choice C)#  Decreased interstitial fluid pressure favors flow into the interstitium and would contribute to the development of peripheral edema. $#Educational objective# Peripheral edema results from the accumulation of fluid in the interstitial spaces.  Factors that promote edema include elevated capillary hydrostatic pressure, decreased plasma oncotic pressure, and impaired lymphatic drainage.  In chronic heart failure, increased lymphatic drainage initially offsets factors favoring edema, temporarily delaying edema development.  "

Closure of a persistent PDA can be achieved with a medication that inhibits prostaglandin synthesis (eg, indomethacin, ibuprofen) or by #surgical ligation#. $When the PDA shunt is ablated during surgery, there is an immediate reduction in pulmonary venous return to the left atrium (ie, #decreased LV preload#) and increased diastolic blood pressure in the aorta (ie, #increased LV afterload#).  The combination of these two immediate changes can result in an acute decrease in LV stroke volume and cardiac output #(choice D).# $#(Choices A, B, and E)#  In patients with a left-to-right shunt through a PDA, the increased volume load is handled entirely by the left ventricle.  The right ventricle receives deoxygenated blood from the body via the superior and inferior vena cava and pumps that blood to the pulmonary artery.  This does not change when the PDA is closed, so there are no postligation changes to preload, afterload, or cardiac output of the right ventricle. $#Educational objective# Closure of a patent ductus arteriosus results in decreased pulmonary venous return to the left atrium (decreased left ventricular preload) and increased diastolic blood pressure in the aorta (increased left ventricular afterload).  Together, these changes acutely lower left ventricular stroke volume and cardiac output.  ",

  "explanation_2": "#Myocardial infarction# (MI) involving the left ventricle (LV) commonly leads to scarring and a sustained reduction in contractile function; however, #contractile function of the right ventricle# (RV) almost always #returns to normal# following MI.  Some of the reasons for protection of the RV from infarction include: $• The relatively #small muscle mass and afterload# of the RV create less oxygen demand and necessitate lower oxygen extraction at rest.  This allows for a #large capacity to increase oxygen extraction# during periods of ischemia. $• The relatively low systolic pressure of the RV (eg, ≤25 mm Hg) allows for #coronary perfusion throughout the cardiac cycle#; during MI, this enables the RV to pull blood flow from collateral vessels during both systole and diastole.  In contrast, the high systolic pressure of the LV (eg, 120 mm Hg) blocks coronary blood flow of the LV walls during systole, allowing for perfusion @during diastole@ only. $These factors likely contribute to the typical clinical course of MI involving the RV, which is acute RV contractile dysfunction often leading to profound hypotension and hemodynamic instability; acute mortality risk is high, but there is minimal long-term RV dysfunction for those who survive. $#(Choice A)#  The large muscle mass of the LV necessitates higher oxygen extraction at rest, with relatively little capacity to increase oxygen extraction during periods of ischemia. $#(Choice B)#  The most robust collateral flow occurs from the left to the right coronary arteries, suggesting the RV has a more developed collateral circulation and may be more dependent on collateral flow than the LV. $#(Choice C)#  Ischemic preconditioning refers to the myocardium being repeatedly exposed to mildly ischemic states (eg, during periods of exercise), which stimulates adjustments (eg, collateral circulation development, cellular improvements in oxygen utilization) that allow future ischemic states to be better tolerated.  The RV is thought to experience heightened ischemic preconditioning compared to the LV, contributing to protection of the RV from infarction. $#(Choice D)#  Fibroblast proliferation is more prominent in the muscular LV, where repair of a larger mass of tissue is needed. $#Educational objective# The right ventricle (RV) is relatively protected from myocardial infarction (MI), and contractile function of the RV usually returns to normal following MI.  Factors contributing to this protection include relatively small muscle mass with high capacity to increase oxygen extraction, perfusion throughout the cardiac cycle, and heightened ischemic preconditioning.

Atrial fibrillation usually occurs in the setting of #atrial remodeling#, which describes changes to the atrial myocardium that result from both normal #aging# and underlying comorbidities that cause #atrial dilation# (eg, hypertension, heart failure, mitral valve disease).  Coronary artery disease and its associated risk factors (eg, diabetes mellitus, smoking) are also associated with atrial fibrillation, although their contribution may be primarily driven by ischemia that leads to left ventricular dysfunction and consequent left atrial dilation. $#Age#, independent of comorbidities, is one of the #strongest risk factors# for atrial fibrillation.  Atrial fibrillation is relatively rare in those age <40, but the prevalence is estimated at approximately 10% in those age >75 and approaches 20% in those age >85. $#(Choices B and D)#  After remodeling has created a susceptible substrate, certain triggers (eg, increased sympathetic drive) can initiate atrial fibrillation.  Heavy alcohol use (eg, large binges or chronic ingestion of >1-2 drinks per day) is one such trigger, but occasional alcohol intake is unlikely to significantly contribute.  High caffeine intake (eg, coffee) may somewhat encourage the triggering of atrial fibrillation (via increased sympathetic stimulation), but there is little evidence to support this association. $#(Choice C)#  This patient's early peaking systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border with prompt and full carotid pulses is consistent with mild aortic stenosis.  Both mitral regurgitation and especially mitral stenosis are strongly associated with atrial fibrillation as these valvular defects can cause left atrial dilation even in the absence of heart failure.  However, aortic stenosis typically must be severe to cause left atrial dilation; mild aortic stenosis is not associated with atrial fibrillation. $#(Choice E)#  Beta adrenergic agonists (eg, albuterol) may sometimes trigger atrial fibrillation by stimulating the generation of ectopic conduction foci.  However, terazosin is an alpha blocker and does not significantly affect cardiac conduction. $#Educational objective# Age, independent of comorbidities, is one of the strongest risk factors for atrial fibrillation as age-related change to the atrial myocardium is one of the primary contributors to atrial remodeling.  Left atrial dilation is the other primary contributor to atrial remodeling; therefore, comorbidities that cause left atrial dilation (eg, hypertension, heart failure, mitral valve disease) are also strongly associated with atrial fibrillation.

  "explanation_2": "This presentation is most suggestive of #aortic regurgitation#.  The inability of aortic valve leaflets to effectively close during diastole leads to regurgitation of blood back into the left ventricular (LV) cavity with an increase in LV end-diastolic volume and wall stress.  The resultant chamber enlargement and eccentric hypertrophy increase total stroke volume, which is often felt as a sense of pounding or an uncomfortable feeling of heartbeat (especially when lying on the left side). $Physical examination reveals an early \"blowing\" #diastolic decrescendo murmur# best heard at the left sternal border in the third or fourth intercostal space.  The precordial impulse is hyperdynamic and displaced laterally and downward.  #Bounding femoral and carotid pulses#, marked by abrupt distension and quick collapse (\"water-hammer\" pulses), are the result of the wide pulse pressure.  Some patients exhibit #head bobbing# with carotid pulsations (de Musset sign) due to transfer of momentum from the large LV stroke volume to the head and neck.  Significant systolic pulsations may also be noticed in other organs (eg, liver, spleen, retina) and the fingertips. $#(Choice B)#  Patients with severe aortic stenosis have a characteristic arterial pulse – small pulse amplitude (pulsus parvus) with a delayed peak and slower upstroke of the arterial pulse (pulsus tardus) due to diminished stroke volume and prolonged ejection time. $#(Choice C)#  The presence of atrial septal defect leads to left-to-right intracardiac shunting, which can cause a hyperdynamic right ventricular impulse.  It does not cause any significant change in arterial pulse character. $#(Choice D)#  Coarctation of the aorta causes systolic hypertension in the upper extremities along with characteristic diminished and/or delayed femoral pulses (brachial-femoral delay). $#(Choice E)#  Arterial pulse, pulse pressure, and forward stroke volume remain normal in patients with chronic (compensated) mitral regurgitation. $#(Choice F)#  Arterial pulses are reduced in volume and amplitude in patients with mitral stenosis due to decreased LV end-diastolic volume and stroke volume. $#(Choices G and H)#  Tricuspid regurgitation and/or pulmonary stenosis are right-sided valvular lesions and do not cause any specific arterial pulse pattern on physical examination. $#Educational objective# Aortic regurgitation causes an increase in total stroke volume with abrupt distension and rapid falloff of peripheral arterial pulses, resulting in a wide pulse pressure.  This leads to bounding peripheral pulses and head bobbing with each heartbeat.  "

Holosystolic murmurs are associated with #tricuspid regurgitation# (TR), mitral regurgitation (MR), and ventricular septal defects (VSDs). $Intrathoracic pressure drops during inspiration, allowing more blood to return to the right heart.  Right ventricular stroke volume rises due to increased venous return.  However, the drop in intrathoracic pressure also increases pulmonary vessel capacity, leading to a transient decrease in left ventricular venous return.  As a result, a TR murmur would be expected to increase in intensity during inspiration (Carvallo sign), whereas murmurs associated with MR or VSD would either decrease or not change.  TR is further favored over MR as TR is loudest near the left sternal border at the second and third intercostal spaces.  MR is heard most prominently over the cardiac apex.

  "explanation_2": "This patient with a systolic murmur along the left sternal border that #decreases in intensity# with maneuvers that# increase left ventricular (LV) blood volume# likely has #hypertrophic cardiomyopathy# (HCM).  HCM typically involves hypertrophy of the interventricular septum that can partially obstruct LV outflow and cause a murmur.  Increases in LV blood volume, caused by @maneuvers@ that increase preload (eg, passive leg elevation) or afterload (eg, handgrip), alleviate LV outflow obstruction and @decrease the intensity@ of the murmur. $Characteristic findings in HCM include #increased LV muscle mass# and a #small LV cavity#.  Because LV contractility is typically intact and outflow obstruction is dynamic and commonly present only with exercise, there is usually #preserved ejection fraction# (EF) at rest (ie, carotid pulses are full).  Diastolic dysfunction is typically present due to #impaired relaxation# of the hypertrophied LV wall. $Affected patients can be asymptomatic or may have exertional symptoms, depending on the level of phenotypic expression and degree of LV outflow tract obstruction. $#(Choices A and E)#  Increased LV mass with a dilated LV cavity, decreased EF, and normal LV relaxation are consistent with dilated cardiomyopathy.  Normal LV mass and cavity size with preserved EF and impaired relaxation describe restrictive cardiomyopathy; the LV walls are stiff but not typically thickened.  Both conditions are likely to lead to symptomatic heart failure with jugular venous distension and pulmonary edema (evidenced by crackles on lung auscultation). $#(Choice B)#  Increased LV mass with normal relaxation and normal (or somewhat increased) LV cavity size and ejection fraction are consistent with athlete's heart, in which physiologic cardiac changes (eg, LV cavity enlargement and wall thickening) improve cardiac function in response to intense endurance training.  A systolic flow murmur may be heard but does not decrease in intensity with maneuvers that increase LV blood volume. $#(Choice C)#  Increased LV mass with small LV cavity size, decreased EF, and impaired relaxation occur in severe aortic stenosis.  The fixed obstruction created by the stenotic valve leads to pressure overload and concentric LV hypertrophy, and also restricts stroke volume to decrease EF.  The murmur of aortic stenosis is similar to that of HCM but is differentiated by a decrease in intensity with maneuvers that decrease, rather than increase, LV preload (eg, abrupt standing, Valsalva strain phase). $#Educational objective# Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) typically involves interventricular septal hypertrophy that obstructs left ventricular (LV) outflow and creates a systolic murmur that decreases in intensity with maneuvers that increase LV blood volume (eg, handgrip, passive leg elevation).

As such, a significant #increase in myocardial oxygen demand# can only be met through a corresponding #increase in coronary blood flow#. $#Coronary autoregulation# is a process that #maintains myocardial blood flow# in settings of decreased coronary perfusion pressure (eg, hemorrhage, sepsis).  Within the region of autoregulation (eg, 60-140 mm Hg), changes in coronary blood flow are driven primarily by myocardial oxygen demand.  This is accomplished mostly by automated alterations in vascular resistance via the release of locally acting mediators, namely #adenosine# (released from cardiomyocytes as ATP is broken down for energy) and #nitric oxide# (synthesized by endothelial cells in response to chemical mediators and mechanical stress). $When myocardial perfusion pressure decreases, there is decreased oxygen delivery to the myocardium and less ATP is regenerated via oxidative metabolism, resulting in increased levels of adenosine.  Myocardial hypoxia also triggers increased synthesis of nitric oxide.  Increased levels of both adenosine and nitric oxide act on vascular smooth muscle to stimulate #vasodilation#, allowing for a relative increase in coronary blood flow at the new, lower perfusion pressure (ie, coronary blood flow is maintained).  A similar process occurs when coronary perfusion pressure increases; decreased levels of adenosine and nitric oxide increase vascular resistance, causing coronary blood flow to remain relatively unchanged at the new, higher perfusion pressure. $#(Choices A and E)#  Acetylcholine causes coronary vasodilation (via stimulation of endothelial nitric oxide release), and norepinephrine causes coronary vasoconstriction (via stimulation of alpha-1 receptors on vascular smooth muscle).  However, compared to locally released mediators, autonomic nervous system stimulation has a relatively small effect on coronary blood flow. $#(Choice B)#  Angiotensin II stimulates vasoconstriction of coronary arteries, but it is not involved in coronary autoregulation. $#(Choice C)#  Histamine has variable vasoconstrictive and vasodilatory effects on coronary arteries depending on the type of histamine receptor triggered.  However, histamine does not play a significant role in coronary autoregulation. $#(Choice F)#  Serotonin primarily functions in the gastrointestinal tract and CNS.  It may cause vasoconstriction of coronary arteries, evidenced by an association between 5HT1-receptor agonists (eg, sumatriptan) and coronary vasospasm.  However, it is not significantly involved in coronary autoregulation. $#Educational objective# Coronary autoregulation allows coronary blood flow to be primarily driven by myocardial oxygen demand over a wide range of perfusion pressures (60-140 mm Hg).  It is mostly accomplished by alterations in vascular resistance via release of adenosine and nitric oxide in response to myocardial hypoxia.  "

Such hemoconcentration can be a clue to hypovolemia caused by salt and/or water depletion; however, it does not occur with hypovolemia due to acute blood loss because red blood cells and albumin are also depleted. $In the setting of hypovolemia, the kidneys respond by increasing sodium reabsorption to increase circulating blood volume.

In this patient's case, imaging is consistent with left ventricular systolic dysfunction secondary to the patient's recent myocardial infarction. $An @S3@, and the other commonly heard #left ventricular gallop#, @S4@ (caused by blood striking a stiff ventricular wall during atrial contraction at the end of diastole), are best heard with the bell of the stethoscope over the #cardiac apex# while the patient is in the left lateral decubitus position.  Listening at #end expiration# makes the sound even more audible by decreasing lung volume and bringing the heart closer to the chest wall. $#(Choices A, B, C, and E)#  Medications and maneuvers that decrease venous return to the heart reduce ventricular blood volume and are likely to lessen the intensity of an S3.  Amyl nitrate inhalation causes dilation of venous capacitance veins to decrease venous return, furosemide injection causes brisk diuresis to reduce intravascular blood volume, standing causes blood to pool in the legs to reduce venous return, and Valsalva strain phase increases intrathoracic pressure to compress the vena cava and reduce venous return. $#Educational objective# An S3 is a low-frequency sound occurring during early diastole, just after S2.  Left ventricular gallops (S3 and S4) are best heard with the bell of the stethoscope over the cardiac apex while the patient is in the left lateral decubitus position at end expiration.  ",

During pulmonary artery (right heart) catheterization, the catheter is advanced to a small branch of the pulmonary artery and the balloon is inflated to obstruct blood flow in that vessel and its distal branches (which eventually form the pulmonary veins).  Because blood flow toward the left atrium (LA) is obstructed beyond this point of occlusion, the pressure at the tip of the \"wedged\" catheter becomes nearly equal to the LA pressure and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP).  This is referred to as the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP). $During @normal diastole@, the LA pressure is nearly equal to the LVEDP as the open mitral valve offers minimal resistance to flow between the 2 chambers.  In patients with #mitral stenosis#, there is resistance to blood flow from the LA to LV that leads to an #increase# in the #LA pressure#.  This increase in LA pressure is transmitted back to the pulmonary veins and is recorded as #elevated PCWP# during pulmonary artery catheterization.  If the LA pressure is sufficiently high to overcome the resistance between the LA and LV, LV filling may not be significantly affected, resulting in #normal LVEDP#. $#(Choice A)#  Aortic stenosis causes a pressure gradient between LV and aortic peak systolic pressures.  LVEDP and PCWP can be elevated in patients with aortic stenosis; however, both these values would remain in approximately the same range. $#(Choice B)#  Cardiac tamponade leads to equalization of average intracardiac diastolic pressures (left ventricular, right ventricular, and pulmonary artery diastolic pressures).  LVEDP and PCWP are both elevated to a similar degree. $#(Choices C and E)#  Both dilated and restrictive cardiomyopathy are associated with pulmonary and systemic venous congestion, resulting in a similar increase in both LVEDP and PCWP.  In dilated cardiomyopathy, this occurs due to systolic dysfunction (impaired ventricular contractility), whereas in restrictive cardiomyopathy this occurs due to diastolic dysfunction (impaired ventricular relaxation/filling). $#Educational objective# Under normal circumstances, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) closely reflects left atrial (LA) and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP).  Mitral stenosis leads to an increase in the LA pressure that is reflected as elevated PCWP during pulmonary artery catheterization.  Left ventricular filling may be normal, resulting in an increased pressure gradient between the LA and LV during diastole.  ",

  "explanation_2": "$#Exercise# is associated with several hemodynamic and vasoregulatory adjustments to provide maximal blood flow to the active muscles.  Stimulation of mechano- and chemoreceptors in the exercising muscle causes sympathetic activation and withdrawal of vagal tone, resulting in increased heart rate (HR), stroke volume, and overall cardiac output #(choice A).#  At higher levels of exercise, HR is predominantly responsible for most of the increase in CO. $Sympathetic discharge causes contraction of the arterioles in all tissues except the actively working muscles, effectively shunting blood toward the exercising muscle.  This also results in an increase in systolic blood pressure, which helps improve perfusion of actively contracting skeletal muscle #(choice D).#  However, the rise in the mean arterial pressure is much lower due to an #overall decrease in systemic vascular resistance#.  This occurs due to the substantial arteriolar vasodilation in active skeletal muscles, which is mediated by local release of adenosine, potassium ions, ATP, CO2, and lactate. $#(Choice B)#  Left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic volume and pressure both rise during exercise due to an increase in LV filling (increased venous return) by peripheral vasoconstriction and the pumping actions of actively contracting muscles. $#(Choice C)#  Pulmonary artery systolic pressure typically rises during exercise; however, similar to systemic circulation, the rise in pulmonary pressure is much smaller than the increase in blood flow across the pulmonary circulation due to a fall in pulmonary vascular resistance. $#Educational objective# Exercising muscles can receive up to 85% of the total cardiac output during periods of strenuous activity.  Although sympathetic discharge during exercise causes increased cardiac output and splanchnic vasoconstriction, there is only a modest increase in mean blood pressure as vasodilation within active skeletal muscles significantly decreases the total systemic vascular resistance.

These changes #reduce aortic compliance#, which #increases pulse pressure# (@pulse pressure@ is directly related to stroke volume and inversely related to aortic compliance).  In youth, ample aortic compliance results in delayed retrograde reflection of pressure waves during ventricular systole, with the waves returning to the heart after aortic valve closure and assisting in coronary artery perfusion.  The reduced compliance that occurs with age hastens the retrograde reflection of pressure waves, causing the waves to return prior to aortic valve closure and increase the load on the left ventricle (ie, #increased SBP#). $Reduced aortic compliance also causes less blood volume to be retained in the arterial system between left ventricular contractions, #slightly decreasing DBP#. $#(Choice A)#  The aortic lumen slightly increases (not decreases) in diameter with age.  Nonetheless, it is the compliance of the large arteries (rather than the diameter) that affects blood pressure.  The diameter of the small arteries (ie, arterioles) determines systemic vascular resistance and is a primary determinant of DBP. $#(Choice B)#  A decrease in stroke volume decreases pulse pressure, leading to reduced SBP.  However, stroke volume is generally maintained with age; a physiologic decrease does not occur. $#(Choice D)#  Renal arterial resistance can increase with age due to the development of renal artery atherosclerosis.  This causes hypertension by activating the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system to cause sodium retention and arteriolar vasoconstriction, resulting in increased DBP (and increased SBP due to unchanged pulse pressure) rather than ISH. $#(Choice E)#  Increased sympathetic tone causes increased DBP (arteriolar vasoconstriction) and increased pulse pressure (increased contractility leading to increased stroke volume).  Increased sympathetic tone often contributes to hypertension in patients age <50, but sympathetic tone decreases with age due to reduced responsiveness of adrenergic receptors. $#Educational objective# The isolated systolic hypertension commonly seen in elderly patients results from age-related stiffening (ie, replacement of elastin with collagen) and reduced compliance of the aorta and other large arteries.

Under normal conditions, splitting of S2 is heard only during inspiration when there is increased venous return to the right heart.  This results in delayed pulmonic valve closure (P2) relative to aortic valve closure (A2) due to the increased time needed for right ventricular blood ejection.  With ASD, right ventricular volume remains increased throughout the entire respiratory cycle, leading to a @persistently delayed P2@ with no apparent respiratory variation in splitting. $#(Choice A)#  @Aortic stenosis@ causes a crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur over the right second intercostal space.  A2 may be delayed until after P2 (paradoxical splitting) due to the increase in left ventricular ejection time. $#(Choice B)#  @Ventricular septal defects@ create a holosystolic murmur along the left lower sternal border due to a high-pressure, left-to-right shunt.  Splitting of S2 may be widened but is usually not fixed.  Fixed splitting is more typical of ASDs because atrial shunts reduce the normal variation in right ventricular volume during the respiratory cycle (flow through the ASD increases when venous return decreases, minimizing inspiratory/expiratory differences in right ventricular volume). $#(Choice D)#  @Aortic insufficiency@ is characterized by regurgitant blood flow through the aortic valve, resulting in a decrescendo diastolic murmur along the sternal border.  Splitting of S2 is usually not affected. $#Educational objective# An atrial septal defect leads to increased right-sided blood flow due to left-to-right shunting.  Characteristic findings are an early-peaking midsystolic ejection murmur over the left upper sternal border (ie, pulmonic flow murmur) and wide and fixed splitting of S2.  ",

Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and is characterized by #absent P waves, irregularly irregular R-R intervals#, and #narrow QRS complexes#.  Rapid, irregular, low amplitude @fibrillatory waves@ are also frequently seen and represent chaotic, continuous atrial depolarizations. $Atrial fibrillation is initiated by aberrant electrical impulses that arise within regions of heightened atrial excitability (most often the pulmonary veins).  Once triggered, atrial fibrillation induces electrical remodeling of the atria with the development of shortened refractory periods and increased conductivity.  This facilitates the creation and persistence of multiple ectopic foci and reentrant impulses within the atria, increasing the risk and chronicity of subsequent episodes (atrial fibrillation begets atrial fibrillation). $#Ventricular response# in atrial fibrillation is dependent on the transmission rate of abnormal atrial impulses through the #atrioventricular (AV) node#.  Each time the AV node is excited, it enters a #refractory period# during which additional atrial impulses cannot be transmitted to the ventricles; consequently, the majority of atrial impulses never reach the ventricles #(choice A).#  The average ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation usually ranges between 90-170/min.  Because atrial excitation is chaotic, the ventricular rate is irregular with no set intervals between contractions. $#(Choice C)#  Bundle branch conductivity determines the duration of the QRS complexes, which are widened when there is bundle branch block.  It does not affect the ventricular contraction rate. $#(Choice D)#  The Purkinje system can assume pacemaker activity in patients with severe bradycardia (<40 beats per minute), but it would not generate impulses in atrial fibrillation since the ventricular rate is typically elevated. $#(Choice E)#  During atrial fibrillation, the atria are in a state of chaotic, continuous depolarization that is independent of sinoatrial node activity. $#(Choice F)#  The ventricular muscle refractory period does not limit the ventricular contraction rate during AF (the ventricular heart rate can approach 300/min in ventricular tachycardia). $#Educational objective# Atrial fibrillation occurs due to irregular, chaotic electrical activity within the atria and presents with absent P waves, irregularly irregular R-R intervals, and narrow QRS complexes.  The atrioventricular node refractory period regulates the number of atrial impulses that reach the ventricles and determines the ventricular contraction rate in conditions where the atria undergo rapid depolarization.

Vasovagal syncope is often triggered by cortical emotions that increase sensitivity to afferent signals, but it can also be triggered situationally by increased afferent transmission from pulmonary, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary mechanoreceptors.  Once these afferent signals are received by the brainstem cardioregulatory center, some combination of the following effector responses occurs: $• Cardioinhibitory response:  #Increased parasympathetic stimulation# to the sinoatrial and atrioventricular (AV) nodes slows the heart rate.  In addition, decreased sympathetic output to the myocardium decreases myocardial contractility. $• Vasodepressor response:  #Decreased sympathetic output# to vascular smooth muscle causes vasodilation of venous capacitance veins (ie, decreased cardiac preload) and systemic arterioles (ie, decreased perfusion pressure) #(choice C).# $The result of these responses is a brief but profound decrease in cardiac output that leads to hypotension, #decreased cerebral perfusion,# and syncope. $#(Choices A and D)#  Cardiac syncope can occur due to the marked reduction in cardiac output that results from arrhythmia (eg, ventricular tachycardia, AV nodal reentrant tachycardia).  Increased automaticity of the Purkinje fibers can trigger ventricular tachycardia, but this usually affects patients with ischemic or structural heart disease.

  "explanation_2": "$The above tracing demonstrates the action potential of cardiac pacemaker cells in cardiac #slow-response tissues# such as the #sinoatrial# (SA) and #atrioventricular# (AV) nodes.  The pacemaker action potential includes the following phases: $• Phase 4 (spontaneous depolarization) begins after hyperpolarization triggers the opening of HCN channels that allow slow influx of Na+ (\"funny current\").  T-type (transient) Ca2+ channels then open once the membrane potential becomes more positive, allowing Ca2+ influx to contribute to depolarization.  As the pacemaker cell approaches threshold, #L-type# (long-lasting) #Ca2+ channels begin to open#, which further increases Ca2+ influx and significantly decreases the time until threshold is reached. $• Phase 0 (upstroke) is characterized by continued opening of L-type Ca2+ channels.  In cardiac slow-response tissues, the action potential upstroke is much slower and transitions gradually from phase 4 due to the relatively slow influx of Ca2+ into the cell. $• Phase 3 (repolarization) is characterized by the opening of K+ channels and efflux of K+ from the cell in conjunction with the closure of L-type Ca2+ channels. $This patient's anxiety-provoked episodes of sudden-onset palpitations associated with lightheadedness and shortness of breath are consistent with #paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia#.  Class IV antiarrhythmics (eg, #verapamil#, diltiazem) are commonly used to prevent recurrent nodal tachyarrhythmias such as PSVT.  They work by #blocking L-type calcium channels# in cardiac slow-response tissues, which causes #slowing of phase 4 depolarization# and reduced conduction velocity in the SA and AV nodes. $#(Choice A)#  Verapamil decreases the amount of intracellular calcium available for excitation-contraction coupling within cardiac myocytes.  This reduces myocardial contractility, which can be harmful in patients with impaired ventricular function.  However, the tracing shown in the question stem corresponds to pacemaker action potentials, not cardiac myocyte action potentials. $#(Choices B and C)#  The threshold potential refers to the amount of depolarization required to initiate an action potential.  Class I (sodium channel blockers) and class IV (calcium channel blockers) antiarrhythmics raise the threshold potential of cardiac fast- and slow-response tissues, respectively, by blocking the channels that trigger an action potential.  This effect also results in reduced action potential amplitude, decreased upslope, and reduced impulse conduction speed within the respective tissues. $#(Choice D)#  Verapamil's calcium blocking activity reduces the action potential duration in nodal tissues, but it also increases the refractory period by slowing the recovery of inactivated calcium channels.  Class IA (eg, quinidine) and class III (eg, amiodarone) antiarrhythmics also increase the refractory period by blocking potassium channels and prolonging repolarization. $#Educational objective# Class IV antiarrhythmics (eg, verapamil, diltiazem) are commonly used to prevent recurrent nodal arrhythmias (eg, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia).  They work by blocking calcium channels in slow-response cardiac tissues, slowing phase 4 (spontaneous depolarization) and phase 0 (upstroke).  This reduces impulse conduction velocity in the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes.  "

MS usually occurs due to underlying rheumatic heart disease, which in the United States is most commonly seen in patients who emigrated from Latin America, Africa, or Asia. $MS can lead to heart failure due to restriction of left ventricular (LV) diastolic filling.  Patients usually experience #exertional dyspnea# as the first symptom, which results from an inability to increase cardiac output to meet exertional demands.  As MS worsens, elevated left atrial pressure can lead to orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, productive cough/hemoptysis, and eventual right-sided heart failure with resulting jugular venous distension and lower extremity edema. $This patient's presentation with exertional dyspnea in the #absence of volume overload# (ie, dry cough, no pulmonary crackles, no peripheral edema) suggests relatively #early, mild-to-moderate# disease.

However, an additional strategy involves augmenting beneficial counter-regulatory mechanisms, such as those involving #natriuretic peptides#. $Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) are released from the myocardium in response to high atrial and ventricular filling pressures (myocardial stretch).  These peptides induce #vasodilation# and #diuresis# (excretion of salt and water) by antagonizing the actions of RAAS and also protect against the deleterious myocardial remodeling and fibrosis that occur in heart failure.  Neprilysin is a metalloprotease that cleaves and inactivates both ANP and BNP.  Therefore, medications that #inhibit neprilysin# (eg, sacubitril) lead to #increased levels of ANP and BNP# and promote beneficial effects in heart failure. $However, because neprilysin is also responsible for inactivating angiotensin II, inhibition of neprilysin further stimulates deleterious vasoconstriction and fluid retention via increased angiotensin II levels.  Therefore, in treating heart failure, neprilysin inhibitors are #combined# with an #angiotensin II-receptor blocker# (eg, sacubitril-valsartan) to mitigate these negative effects. $#(Choice A)#  Increased levels of ANP and BNP stimulate the excretion of both salt and water.

These effects would be counteracted by angiotensin II-induced vasoconstriction, but angiotensin II activity is blocked by combining the neprilysin inhibitor with an angiotensin II-receptor blocker. $#(Choice C)#  Neprilysin inhibition combined with angiotensin II receptor blockade improves cardiac output in heart failure via a reduction in the cardiac work required to attain a certain stroke volume; however, cardiac contractility is not significantly affected. $#Educational objective# Neprilysin is responsible for the breakdown of the natriuretic peptides and angiotensin II; therefore, inhibition of neprilysin increases the activity of these peptides.  For treatment of heart failure, neprilysin inhibition is combined with angiotensin II receptor blockade to optimize the positive effects of the natriuretic peptides (eg, vasodilation, diuresis) while blocking the negative effects of angiotensin II (eg, vasoconstriction, fluid retention).

Following significant intravascular volume depletion, baroreceptors in the aorta and carotid arteries rapidly adjust autonomic output to help maintain blood pressure. $Baroreceptors are stretch-sensitive mechanoreceptors that increase their firing rate in response to arterial distension.

Most cardiac venous blood drains into the right atrium via the #coronary sinus#, with the remainder draining directly into the other chambers of the heart.  Three specific features distinguish cardiac circulation from blood flow to skeletal muscle and viscera:  $1. #The left ventricle is perfused only during diastole.#  Myocardial contraction during systole leads to compression of the coronary vessels and disruption of blood flow.  Wall tension is highest near the endocardium, making the subendocardial region the most prone to ischemia.  $2. #Myocardial oxygen extraction is very high.#  The heart has a capillary density far exceeding that of skeletal muscle.  Oxygen extraction from arterial blood is very effective within the heart as the resting myocardium extracts 60%-75% of oxygen from blood.  This amount is higher than that extracted by any other tissue or organ in the body.  As a result, the cardiac venous blood in the coronary sinus, before it reaches the right atrium and mixes with blood returning from the systemic circulation, is the most deoxygenated blood in the body #(choices A, C, D, and F)#.  $3. #Myocardial oxygen demand and coronary blood flow are tightly coupled.#  Because oxygen extraction by the resting heart is already very high, there is little capacity to increase myocardial oxygen extraction during periods of increased oxygen demand (eg, during exercise).  Therefore, increased oxygen delivery to the heart can be achieved only through increased #coronary blood flow#.  Adenosine and nitric oxide are the most important vasodilators responsible for increasing coronary flow. $#(Choice E)#  Deoxygenated systemic blood returning via the vena cava contains more oxygen than coronary sinus venous blood.  Because the pulmonary artery contains an admixture of blood returning via coronary sinus and systemic venous circulation, its oxygen content is also higher than pure coronary venous return. $#Educational objective# Myocardial oxygen extraction exceeds that of any other tissue or organ; therefore, the cardiac venous blood in the coronary sinus is the most deoxygenated blood in the body.

This patient with palpitations and an #irregularly irregular# pulse most likely has #atrial fibrillation#, the most common cause of an irregularly irregular rhythm. $In atrial fibrillation, the atria experience rapid and chaotic electrical activity, and organized atrial depolarization is lost.

Therefore, @ECG@ typically shows an #absence of P waves# and an irregularly irregular rhythm with #varying R-R intervals#; the ventricular rate is often (but not always) >100/min.  In addition, irregular, low-amplitude #fibrillatory waves# are sometimes present between the QRS complexes. $The development of atrial fibrillation is encouraged by #atrial remodeling#, which involves changes to atrial conduction pathways that occur as a result of aging and underlying chronic disease (eg, hypertension, heart failure).  Once a certain degree of remodeling is present, acute illness (eg, sepsis or other causes of increased sympathetic tone) and other conditions (eg, hyperthyroidism) can initiate foci of electrical activity that #trigger# the arrhythmia.

There is also vasoconstriction of the splanchnic circulation and a higher degree of vasodilation in skeletal muscle, which shunts blood away from the gastrointestinal tract toward skeletal muscle and causes overall #reduced systemic vascular resistance# (SVR).

The Frank-Starling effect states that as cardiac muscle is increasingly stretched, the cardiac output increases (up to a limit, as illustrated by the flat portion of the curve).  This is essentially the same length-tension relationship that is seen in skeletal muscle. $The venous return curve represents how venous return changes with variations in right atrial pressure.  Where the venous return curve intersects with the x-axis, it indicates a venous return of zero.  At this point, all circulatory flow ceases, and the pressure throughout the circulatory system equalizes.  This average pressure is termed the mean systemic filling pressure, which is a measure of the degree of filling of the circulatory system relative to the circulatory capacity.

Total peripheral resistance (TPR) affects the slope of both the venous return and cardiac output curves.  Increases in the TPR decrease the slope of both curves, as higher vascular resistance restricts venous return and increases afterload. $The dashed lines in the question image depict decreased cardiac output and an unchanged venous return (unchanged blood volume and TPR).  An isolated decrease in cardiac output indicates decreased contractility that is not the result of decreased preload (because the venous return line is unchanged).

  "explanation_2": "$Calcium plays an important role in excitation-contraction coupling in cardiac, smooth, and skeletal muscle cells.  Myocyte depolarization causes activation of L-type calcium channels on the plasma membrane.  In @#cardiac@ and @smooth muscle cells@#, this leads to an #influx of extracellular calcium# that activates sarcoplasmic RyR channels, inducing the release of additional calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (calcium-induced calcium release).  The released calcium binds to troponin (cardiac muscle) or calmodulin (smooth muscle), allowing actin and myosin to interact and cause muscle contraction. $In contrast, the L-type calcium channels in #skeletal muscle# directly interact with RyR calcium channels to release calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.  This #mechanical coupling# between the receptors allows sarcoplasmic calcium release to occur without significant influx of calcium across the plasma membrane.  #Verapamil# is a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that acts by #blocking L-type calcium channels#, preventing the initial calcium influx into cardiac myocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells.  Because skeletal muscle is not dependent on extracellular calcium influx, calcium channel blockers do not affect skeletal muscle contractility. $#(Choice A)#  Troponin (but not calmodulin) is responsible for contraction of both cardiac and skeletal muscle.  Unlike skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle is affected by verapamil due to its dependence on extracellular calcium to induce calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. $#(Choice B)#  A rise in intracellular calcium concentration results in a structural change in the troponin complex that allows actin and myosin to interact and cause skeletal muscle contraction.  Calcium channel blockers do not affect troponin's affinity to intracellular calcium. $#(Choice C)#  An elaborate T tubule system is present in skeletal and cardiac muscle but not in smooth muscle.  T tubules are a communication of the extracellular space that allows the depolarization impulse to reach deep into the cell, nearer to the myofilaments.  They are in close proximity to the sarcoplasmic reticulum and therefore facilitate rapid release of intracellular calcium stores. $#(Choice D)#  Unlike cardiac myocytes and specialized smooth muscle tissue (eg, gastrointestinal tract, ureters), skeletal muscle does not display automaticity and contracts only in response to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.  However, the mechanical coupling between L-type and RyR calcium channels is responsible for skeletal muscle's resistance to verapamil. $#Educational objective# Contraction initiation in cardiac and smooth muscle cells is dependent on extracellular calcium influx through L-type calcium channels, which can be prevented by calcium channel blockers (eg, verapamil).  Skeletal muscle is resistant to calcium channel blockers, as calcium release by the sarcoplasmic reticulum is triggered by a mechanical interaction between L-type and RyR calcium channels.  ",

  "explanation_2": "$#Dilated cardiomyopathy# (DCM) occurs due to a direct insult to the myocardium that leads to a decrease in contractile function of one or both ventricles with a consequent increase in ventricular cavity size.  It can result from a variety of causes, including viral infection, chemical toxicity (eg, doxorubicin, alcohol, cocaine), and infiltrative disease (late manifestation).  Patients typically have symptoms of decompensated heart failure (eg, fatigue, dyspnea, orthopnea).  In addition, the left ventricular structural changes place these patients at risk for sudden cardiac death due to #ventricular arrhythmia#. $Patients are classified as having idiopathic DCM when no apparent cause of DCM is identified on routine clinical evaluation.  A large percentage of these patients likely have a familial (inherited) cause.  #Familial DCM# can result from a variety of genetic mutations affecting either sarcomere (ie, the contractile apparatus) or nonsarcomere proteins.  Truncating mutations (usually nonsense mutations) affecting the #TTN gene#, which encodes for the sarcomere protein #titin#, are the most common cause of familial DCM.  Titin is an elastic protein that anchors the beta-myosin heavy chain to the Z-discs and likely contributes to passive myocardial tension; absence of the full titin protein leads to myocardial dysfunction. $TTN gene mutations follow #autosomal dominant# inheritance; however, they have incomplete penetrance, leading to delayed or absent clinical manifestations in some family members. $#(Choice A)#  Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy is characterized by fibrosis and scarring of right ventricular myocardium, which predisposes to ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.  Familial disease most commonly results from impaired desmosome function due to mutations in genes encoding desmosomal proteins (eg, plakoglobin, desmoplakin). $#(Choice B)#  Familial bicuspid aortic valve disease has been associated with a mutation affecting the NOTCH1 gene that encodes transcription regulatory proteins. $#(Choice D)#  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a common cause of sudden cardiac death in young patients.  It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and most commonly involves mutations in the genes encoding beta-myosin heavy chain or myosin-binding protein C. $#(Choice E)#  Restrictive cardiomyopathy most commonly results from infiltrative disease (eg, amyloidosis, hemochromatosis, sarcoidosis); however, familial disease does occur.  Familial restrictive cardiomyopathy typically involves mutations in genes encoding one of several sarcomere or cytoskeletal proteins, but mutations of the TTN gene are not a well-established cause. $#Educational objective# Autosomal dominant mutations in the TTN gene, which encodes for the sarcomere protein titin, are the most common cause of familial dilated cardiomyopathy.

  "explanation_2": "$This young patient had a #cryptogenic stroke#, which is evaluated with echocardiography with a \"bubble study\" to identify right-to-left intracardiac shunts.  This study is performed by injecting agitated normal saline intravenously and observing for microbubbles in the left heart.  Shunt detection is improved by having the patient release a sustained Valsalva maneuver, which increases right atrial pressure.  Cryptogenic stroke is frequently associated with atrial septal abnormalities such as #patent foramen ovale# (PFO) and atrial septal defect (ASD). $During fetal development, the foramen ovale shunts oxygenated fetal blood across from the right to the left atrium.  After delivery, umbilical cord clamping and decreased pulmonary vascular resistance lower right atrial pressure and raise left atrial pressure.  This pushes the #septum primum# against the #septum secundum#, closing the foramen ovale.  Over time, fibrosis and tissue remodeling fuse the flap closed.  #Incomplete fusion# occurs in approximately 25% of normal adults, resulting in a PFO. $PFO usually remains functionally closed and asymptomatic after birth as left atrial pressure is greater than right atrial pressure.  However, conditions that raise right atrial pressure above left atrial pressure (eg, Valsalva release) produce a transient right-to-left shunt across the PFO.  This is particularly concerning in patients with hypercoagulability (eg, oral contraceptive use) as they are at increased risk for venous thrombosis and #paradoxical brain embolism#.  Chronically elevated right heart pressure (eg, Eisenmenger syndrome) is not necessary for paradoxical embolism. $#(Choice A)#  ASD results from aplasia of the septum primum or septum secundum during development.  Although ASD may lead to paradoxical embolism, it is much less common than PFO and characterized by fixed splitting of S2.  Unrepaired ASDs may lead to heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, or Eisenmenger syndrome. $#(Choice B)#  Incomplete development of the aorticopulmonary septum results in @truncus arteriosus@, which causes cyanosis in newborns and requires early surgical repair. $#(Choice C)#  Incomplete closure of the interventricular foramen results in @ventricular septal defect@ (VSD), which causes a holosystolic murmur at the lower left sternal border.  Large VSDs can cause significant left-to-right shunting, leading to heart failure in infancy; however, VSDs infrequently lead to paradoxical embolism. $#(Choice E)#  The ductus arteriosus functionally closes within 24 hours after delivery.  Persistent @patent ductus arteriosus@ causes a continuous murmur and may eventually result in heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, or Eisenmenger syndrome. $#Educational objective# The foramen ovale is patent in approximately 25% of normal adults.  Although the foramen ovale usually remains functionally closed, transient increases of right atrial pressure above left atrial pressure can produce a right-to-left shunt, leading to paradoxical embolism of venous clots into the arterial circulation.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient's clinical presentation (#cyanotic spells# that improve with #squatting#, prominent right ventricular impulse, #systolic murmur#) is consistent with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF).  Abnormal neural crest cell migration leads to anterior and cephalad deviation of the infundibular septum during embryologic development, resulting in a malaligned VSD and an overriding aorta.  TOF is characterized by 4 distinct anatomic abnormalities: $• Ventricular septal defect (VSD) $• verriding aorta over the right and left ventricles $• Right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) obstruction $• Right ventricular hypertrophy $Cyanosis occurs due to the presence of right-to-left shunt in patients with severe or worsening #RVOT obstruction#.  The typical harsh, systolic ejection murmur over the mid-to-left upper sternal border is due to the presence of RVOT obstruction (subvalvular, pulmonary valve stenosis or supravalvular narrowing in the main pulmonary artery).  Squatting increases the peripheral systemic vascular resistance (afterload) and decreases the degree of right-to-left shunting across the VSD, thereby improving cyanosis. $#(Choice A)#  In @anomalous pulmonary venous return@, blood from both the pulmonary (oxygenated) and systemic (deoxygenated) venous systems flow into the right atrium, leading to right atrial and ventricular dilation.  Patients also have obligatory right-to-left atrial shunting. $#(Choice B)#  Aortic arch constriction results in @coarctation of the aorta@ and is most commonly located just distal to the left subclavian artery (juxtaductal).  Common manifestations include brachial-femoral pulse delay and blood pressure discrepancy between the upper and lower extremities. $#(Choice D)#  Failed fusion of the superior and inferior endocardial cushions (eg, endocardial cushion defect) results in defects of the atrioventricular septum and valves (mitral and tricuspid valves).  These typically manifest initially as atrial defects and/or VSDs with left-to-right shunting of blood.  Over time, the increased right-sided blood flow leads to pulmonary hypertension with reversal of blood flow through the shunt and development of cyanosis (@Eisenmenger syndrome@).  This patient has had cyanotic symptoms since birth that would not be expected with an isolated endocardial cushion defect. $#(Choice E)#  @Transposition of the great arteries@ results from linear, rather than spiral, development of the aorticopulmonary septum in utero. $#Educational objective# Tetralogy of Fallot results from anterior and cephalad deviation of the infundibular septum during embryologic development, resulting in a malaligned ventricular septal defect (VSD) with an overriding aorta.  As a result, the patient has right ventricular outflow obstruction (resulting in a systolic murmur) and squats to increase the peripheral systemic vascular resistance (afterload) and decrease right-to-left shunting across the VSD.

  "explanation_2": "$This newborn's echocardiogram is indicative of #transposition of the great arteries# (TGA), a cyanotic congenital heart defect characterized by @abnormal origination@ of the aorta/pulmonary artery.  In early gestation, there is a single outflow tract from the rudimentary heart that is subsequently divided into the aorta and pulmonary artery by the #aorticopulmonary septum#.  This septum normally spirals during outflow tract division to create an anteriorly located pulmonary artery arising from the right ventricle and a posteriorly located aorta arising from the left ventricle. $TGA occurs due to #failed spiraling# of the aorticopulmonary septum, resulting in an #anterior aorta# that originates from the right ventricle and a #posterior pulmonary artery# that originates from the left ventricle.  @Parallel@ pulmonary and systemic circuits are created, and #deoxygenated blood# is delivered from the right ventricle to the #systemic circulation# via the aorta. $Neonates with TGA often have cyanosis, tachypnea, and tachycardia immediately after birth; however, some may have normal examination findings initially due to shunting of oxygenated blood to the systemic circulation via the @ductus arteriosus@, with cyanosis developing after 24-48 hours as the ductus begins to close.  Other mixing lesions, such as a large ventricular septal defect, can also mask the development of clinically-apparent cyanosis.

PDA in a patient with TGA tends to delay the development of cyanosis. $#(Choice D)#  Failed conotruncal septation results in persistent @truncus arteriosus@.  Although affected patients typically develop neonatal cyanosis, an echocardiogram would reveal a single arterial trunk.  This patient's distinct aorta and pulmonary artery indicate conotruncal septation has occurred. $#Educational objective# Transposition of the great arteries is a cyanotic congenital heart condition resulting from failed spiraling of the aorticopulmonary septum during embryonic development.

These neutrophils phagocytize dead myocytes and release #lysosomal enzymes#, reactive oxygen species, and #cytokines# (eg, IL-1, TNF-α) that can prevent infiltration by pathogens and facilitate wound healing. $• From 3 to 10 days post-MI, macrophages infiltrate and phagocytize dead myocytes and neutrophils while initiating the formation of granulation tissue by producing cytokines (eg, IL-10) and growth factors (TGF-β) #(choice C).# $• From 10 to 14 days post-MI, prominent fibroblast proliferation, collagen deposition, and neovascularization of @granulation tissue@ are present. $• From 2 weeks to 2 months post-MI, collagen remodeling and fibroblast differentiation into myofibroblasts drive the formation of @scar tissue@ #(choice D).# $• After 2 months post-MI, remodeling continues to a slower rate as the scar matures and contracts #(choice E).# $#Educational objective# Irreversible myocardial ischemic injury initiates a series of predictable morphologic changes over the hours to weeks after the initial injury.  From 1 and 3 days after the initial injury, neutrophils infiltrate the border zone of the injured tissue (where myocytes are relatively normal) in response to proinflammatory cytokines (eg, IL-6, IL-8), eventually migrating to the central portion of the infarct.
