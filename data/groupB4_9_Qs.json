The diagnosis of CF typically is based on elevated sweat chloride concentrations, characteristic clinical findings (#recurrent sinopulmonary infections#, pancreatic insufficiency), and/or a positive family history.  However, patients with mild mutations of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene may have normal sweat testing.  In these cases, a useful diagnostic adjunct involves measuring the nasal transepithelial potential difference. $In intestinal and #respiratory epithelia#, the CFTR channel secretes chloride ions into the lumen and also has a tonic inhibitory effect on the opening of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), which decreases sodium reabsorption into the cell.  This high luminal salt content helps retain water in the lumen, forming well-hydrated mucus.  During the #nasal transepithelial potential difference# test, a saline solution is applied to the nose.  Because patients with CF have #increased sodium absorption# via the ENaC, sodium is absorbed intracellularly but chloride in the saline solution is retained in the lumen.  The higher relative amounts of negatively charged chloride on the epithelial surface result in a #more negative# transepithelial voltage difference. $CFTR channel functioning is reversed in @sweat ducts@ compared with that in respiratory and intestinal glands.  CFTR reduces the salt content of sweat by reabsorbing luminal chloride and stimulating ENaC to increase sodium absorption from the lumen into the cells.  CFTR mutations therefore result in the production of sweat with high chloride and sodium content. $#(Choice A)#  CFTR mutations lower the rate of bicarbonate secretion in the pancreatic ducts, promoting mucin precipitation and the formation of intraductal concretions that cause exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.  However, this effect is not related to the nasal transepithelial potential difference test. $#(Choice B)#  CFTR mutations impair the passive transport of chloride along its concentration gradient, decreasing chloride secretion by respiratory epithelial cells. $#(Choice C)#  The water content of mucus is decreased (not increased) in patients with CF, resulting in dehydrated mucus that predisposes to the formation of mucus plugs and chronic sinopulmonary infections. $#(Choice E)#  CFTR mutations do not significantly alter transmembrane potassium transport. $#Educational objective# In cystic fibrosis, impairment of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein reduces chloride secretion and increases sodium absorption by the respiratory epithelia, resulting in dehydrated mucus.

The movement of chloride establishes a membrane potential that draws sodium and water across the membrane as well.

In unaffected individuals, the CFTR protein serves as a chloride channel that regulates the flow of sodium, chloride, and water across the epithelial membranes of the airways, biliary tree, intestines, sweat ducts, and pancreatic ducts. $Newborn screening for CF is performed in the United States, but positive results should be confirmed by #sweat testing#.  When eccrine sweat is first produced, it is isotonic with extracellular fluid.  As sweat travels through the eccrine duct to the skin's surface, chloride is normally resorbed via CFTR, and sodium and water follow.  CFTR facilitates production of hypotonic sweat in patients without CF.  However, patients with CF are unable to reabsorb chloride and sodium in the eccrine ducts and therefore secrete #sweat with high sodium and chloride# levels. $The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms (lethargy, vomiting) is #hyponatremia due to excessive salt wasting# from his sweat.  Risk factors for hyponatremia in patients with CF include exclusive breast or formula feeding prior to the introduction of sodium-rich, solid foods; exposure to high-temperature environments; and exercise.  Therefore, #salt supplementation# is recommended for patients with CF. $#(Choice A)#  Chloride ions are an important contributor to extracellular fluid volume, and hypochloremia is also very common in patients with CF due to sweat losses.  In contrast, hyperchloremia is more likely to develop in normal patients with excessive sweating due to increased free water loss from hypotonic sweat. $#(Choice B)#  Hyperkalemia typically occurs with cell lysis (eg, rhabdomyolysis, tumor lysis syndrome), metabolic acidosis (due to intracellular to extracellular K+ shift), or abnormalities with renal excretion. $#(Choice C)#  Hypernatremia classically occurs with excessive salt intake or free water loss (eg, diarrhea, diabetes insipidus, improperly prepared infant formula).  Patients with CF typically do not experience hypernatremia as they lose excess sodium through their sweat glands. $#(Choice D)#  Hypomagnesemia most commonly arises from urinary loss due to medications (eg, loop diuretics), alcohol use, or uncontrolled diabetes mellitus with polyuria. $#Educational objective# Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) produce eccrine sweat with higher-than-normal concentrations of sodium and chloride.  Exposure to high temperature or exercise can lead to hyponatremia and hypochloremia due to excessive sodium chloride loss through sweat; therefore, salt supplementation is recommended.  "}
