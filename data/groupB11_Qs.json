The #superior thyroid artery# and vein and #external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve# course together in a neurovascular triad that originates superior to the thyroid gland and lateral to the thyroid cartilage.  The external branch is at risk of injury during thyroidectomy as it courses just deep to the superior thyroid artery. $ The #cricothyroid muscle# is the only muscle innervated by this nerve.  It originates on the cricoid cartilage and inserts on the lower border of the thyroid cartilage.  The cricothyroid muscle acts to tense the vocal cords, and denervation injury may cause a low, hoarse voice with limited range of pitch.  The internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve does not innervate any muscles but provides sensory innervation to the laryngeal mucosa above the vocal folds. $ #(Choices A, C, D, and E)#  The remaining laryngeal muscles are innervated by the recurrent laryngeal nerves, which also provide sensory innervation to the larynx below the vocal folds.  The recurrent laryngeal nerves lie posterior to the thyroid, near the inferior thyroid arteries.  These nerves can be injured during thyroidectomy but do not run with the superior thyroid artery at the superior pole of the thyroid. $ Educational objective The external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve is at risk of injury during thyroidectomy due to its proximity to the superior thyroid artery and vein.  This nerve innervates the cricothyroid muscle."

DI can be due to deficient ADH production in the brain #(central)# or resistance to ADH in the kidneys (nephrogenic).  Injection of exogenous ADH can help distinguish between central and nephrogenic DI: #ADH administration# substantially #increases urine osmolality# in patients with central DI, whereas patients with nephrogenic DI typically have a more limited increase in urine osmolality (<300 mOsm/L increase).$ ADH is synthesized by magnocellular neurosecretory cells in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus.  These neurons project axons to the posterior pituitary where axon terminals store large quantities of ADH for later release into the circulation.  Injury to the hypothalamus or posterior pituitary (eg, head trauma, transsphenoidal neurosurgery, suprasellar masses) can result in central DI.  Damage to the more distal portions of the hypothalamic-hypophyseal tract (ie, below the infundibulum) typically causes transient DI because the cell bodies of the magnocellular neurons remain intact.  However, #hypothalamic injury# results in death of the magnocellular neurons, causing #permanent central DI#. $(Choice A)  The anterior pituitary produces ACTH, TSH, gonadotrophic hormones, prolactin, and growth hormone.  Hormone secretion from the anterior pituitary is regulated by substances released from the median eminence into the hypothalamic-hypophyseal portal vessels. $(Choice C)  Although head trauma is a frequent cause of central DI, traumatic damage to the kidneys does not result in nephrogenic DI.  Furthermore, this patient's large increase in urine concentration following ADH administration is more suggestive of central DI. $(Choice D)  Isolated posterior pituitary damage most often causes transient central DI because the cell bodies of the magnocellular neurons remain intact and can undergo axonal regeneration to allow adequate ADH release into the circulation. $ (Choice E)  Thalamic nuclei are involved in relaying sensory and motor signals to the cerebral cortex and in regulating alertness and consciousness. $ Educational objective Injury to the hypothalamus or posterior pituitary (eg, head trauma, transsphenoidal neurosurgery, suprasellar masses) can result in central diabetes insipidus (DI).

Most follicular thyroid neoplasms are benign follicular adenomas, but 15%-30% can be malignant follicular carcinomas.  Both types of follicular neoplasms have a similar appearance on ultrasound and FNA. $Differentiating between benign and malignant follicular lesions can only be accomplished by histologic examination of the entire tumor (eg, thyroidectomy). $• @Follicular adenomas@ (the most common benign thyroid neoplasm) display numerous neoplastic follicular cells and microfollicles on histology but are completely encapsulated. $• In contrast, #follicular thyroid carcinomas# are characterized by #invasion of the tumor capsule# and/or surrounding blood vessels. $This propensity of follicular thyroid carcinomas to invade surrounding blood vessels accounts for their tendency to metastasize via #hematogenous spread# to distant tissues (eg, bone, lung). $#(Choice A)#  @Medullary thyroid carcinomas@ can develop sporadically or in patients with an inherited RET proto-oncogene mutation (eg, multiple endocrine neoplasia 2a or 2b).  In patients with this germline mutation, C-cell hyperplasia is often found as a precursor to a malignant lesion.  Malignant C cells secrete calcitonin, which can form amyloid deposits within the tumor. $#(Choice B)#  @Papillary thyroid carcinoma@ (the most common type of thyroid malignancy) has distinct cytologic and histologic features.  These include laminar calcifications (psammoma bodies), large cells with pale, empty-appearing nuclei (Orphan Annie–eye or ground-glass nuclei) with nuclear inclusion bodies and nuclear grooves.  Unlike FTC, papillary thyroid carcinoma can be diagnosed on FNA results. $#(Choice C)#  @Hürthle cells@ are large, polygonal cells with granular, eosinophilic cytoplasm due to large quantities of mitochondria.  They are a nonspecific finding seen in a wide variety of neoplastic and nonneoplastic thyroid lesions.  Therefore, they would not be of benefit in differentiating between benign and malignant follicular lesions. $#(Choice D)#  @Chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto) thyroiditis@ typically presents with signs of primary hypothyroidism (eg, weight gain, cold intolerance, elevated TSH) due to autoimmune destruction of the thyroid gland.  Histology shows inflammation and lymphocytic germinal centers in the thyroid gland. $#(Choice E)#  Multinucleated giant cells are seen in many thyroid conditions, including thyroiditis, cystic degeneration, and papillary thyroid carcinoma.  They are not typically seen in follicular lesions. $#Educational objective# Follicular neoplasms typically present as slowly enlarging, painless thyroid nodules.  Differentiation between a follicular adenoma and follicular thyroid carcinoma is not possible using only fine-needle aspiration results.  Histologic evidence of invasion of the tumor capsule and/or surrounding blood vessels is needed to diagnose follicular thyroid carcinoma. ",

  "explanation_2": "Hemoglobin A1c is produced by irreversible nonenzymatic glycosylation of the N-terminal of the hemoglobin molecule.  The degree of glycosylation (ie, hemoglobin A1c level) directly correlates with average blood glucose levels over the life span of circulating erythrocytes, which is normally approximately 3 months.  #Higher glucose levels# and #increased exposure time #of red cells to glucose #increase hemoglobin A1c# values.  As such, conditions that alter red blood cell survival time also affect hemoglobin A1c levels. $This patient has an elevated @hemoglobin A2@, which suggests comorbid #beta-thalassemia minor#.  Hemoglobin A2 is elevated in beta-thalassemia to compensate for beta-globin–chain underproduction, but results in microcytic red cells that are prone to hemolysis.  #Increased erythrocyte turnover# results in a #misleadingly low hemoglobin A1c level#.  In such cases, measurement of glycated serum proteins (ie, fructosamine) is sometimes used to estimate glycemic control. $#(Choices B and C)#  Deficiencies of iron, folate, and vitamin B12 can reduce production of new red cells, leading to a preponderance of older erythrocytes and falsely elevated hemoglobin A1c.  In contrast, treatment of vitamin deficiencies causes young red cells to be rapidly released into circulation, falsely lowering hemoglobin A1c. $#(Choice D)#  Advanced diabetic nephropathy may cause reduced erythropoietin production.  The resulting decrease in production of new red cells may lead to falsely high hemoglobin A1c (similar to nutrient deficiencies). $#(Choice E)#  Chronically elevated blood glucose (ie, poor glycemic control) is the primary cause of increased hemoglobin A1c in patients with diabetes. $#(Choice F)#  Sickle cell trait is characterized by heterozygous carriage of hemoglobin S.  Some patients with sickle cell trait can have slightly reduced hemoglobin A1c level due to increased red cell turnover (homozygous individuals with sickle cell disease have rapid red cell turnover and very low A1c).  However, hemoglobin A2 percentage remains near normal in patients with sickle cell mutations. $#Educational objective# Hemoglobin A1c is produced by nonenzymatic glycosylation of the hemoglobin molecule.  A hemoglobin A1c assay provides an estimate of chronic glycemic control over the life span of circulating erythrocytes (~3 months).

  "explanation_2": "$Amenorrhea is categorized as primary (no onset of menarche by age 15) or secondary (no menses for ≥3 months in premenopausal patients with previously regular menses).  This patient has #secondary amenorrhea#, which usually occurs due to endocrine dysfunction (eg, hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis dysfunction, thyroid disorder), pregnancy, or intrauterine adhesions (ie, Asherman syndrome). $This patient's distorted body image (feeling overweight despite underweight BMI), restricted diet, exercise regimen, dry skin, and lanugo (fine hair indicating inadequate caloric intake) suggest #anorexia nervosa#, a common cause of #functional hypothalamic amenorrhea# (FHA).  The pathophysiology of FHA is incompletely understood but is thought to arise due to diminished adipose tissue stores, which reduce circulating leptin levels.  In response, the hypothalamus decreases the amplitude and frequency of pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release, leading to #low GnRH# levels, #decreased pituitary LH and FSH# secretion, #low circulating estrogen# levels, anovulation, and amenorrhea #(choices C and E)#. $In addition to anorexia nervosa, FHA can also occur when caloric expenditure is out of proportion to intake, such as in female #athletes# (eg, distance runners, dancers) or patients with chronic illness, particularly those with low adipose stores.  FHA is a form of hypogonadotrophic (low LH and FSH) hypogonadism (low estrogen).  Therefore, potential complications in young patients include reduced peak bone mass, which may lead to early-onset #osteoporosis#. $#(Choice A)#  Low circulating estrogen levels despite increased GnRH and FSH secretion are consistent with a primary ovarian disorder (eg, primary ovarian insufficiency [POI], menopause).  POI is associated with Turner syndrome and prior chemoradiation, not anorexia nervosa. $#(Choice B)#  Pituitary dysfunction, which includes anatomic (eg, prolactinoma) and functional disorders (eg, hypopituitarism due to infarction [Sheehan syndrome]), can cause hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and amenorrhea characterized by increased GnRH, low FSH and LH, and low estrogen.  However, prolactinomas typically present with additional clinical features (eg, bilateral galactorrhea), and Sheehan syndrome is usually associated with prior hemorrhage, particularly obstetric hemorrhage. $#Educational objective# Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea is a common cause of secondary amenorrhea and occurs due to decreased amplitude and frequency of pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone release from the hypothalamus, which in turn leads to low FSH, LH, and estrogen levels.  Causes include anorexia nervosa (eg, distorted body image, restricted diet, lanugo), excessive strenuous exercise, and chronic illness. "

  "explanation_2": "This patient has a plantar ulcer under the first metatarsal head.  In a patient with chronic, poorly controlled #diabetes mellitus#, this is likely a #neuropathic ulcer# due to underlying peripheral #sensory neuropathy#.  Chronic hyperglycemia promotes nerve injury and impairs nerve repair in distal sensory fibers, causing decreased sensation of pain, pressure, and proprioception. $Loss of these protective senses can cause individuals to not recognize an injury due to minor trauma, friction, or #pressure#.  Areas that are particularly susceptible are points of localized pressure created by a shoe or weight-bearing bones of the foot (eg, plantar surface of the #first metatarsal head#).  A wound in this area often goes unnoticed (due to lack of pain sensation and being hidden by socks or shoes) and can develop into a nonhealing @foot ulcer@. $Loss of proprioception and an increase in ligamentous laxity can also cause chronic pressure-induced joint/skin damage in the feet of patients with diabetic neuropathy, which can lead to calluses or foot deformities (eg, @Charcot foot@, @hammer toe@). $#(Choice A)#  Although diabetic patients (especially those who smoke) often have comorbid arterial insufficiency, arterial ulcers are typically painful, sharply demarcated, and located at the tips of the toes.  This patient has full distal pulses, which makes clinically significant atherosclerotic disease unlikely to be the primary cause of the ulcer. $#(Choice B)#  Bacterial infection may delay ulcer healing, especially if there is underlying osteomyelitis, but it is not the inciting cause of neuropathic ulcers.  In addition, although diabetic ulcers are often colonized by bacteria, this patient has no fever, erythema, or purulent drainage to suggest serious infection. $#(Choice C)#  @Irritant contact dermatitis@ presents with pruritic or painful erythema in areas of exposed skin (eg, hands).  It can occasionally cause small vesicles or fissures, but ulcers are not typical. $#(Choice E)#  Systemic vasculitic disorders (eg, polyarteritis nodosa) are an uncommon cause of skin ulcers.  Vasculitic ulcers are usually painful and associated with other skin (eg, purpura, nodules) and systemic (eg, fever, fatigue) symptoms. $#(Choice F)#  Ulcers caused by @venous insufficiency@ are most common over the tibias or proximal to the medial malleolus.  They present as irregular ulcerations in the setting of stasis dermatitis and/or varicose veins. $#Educational objective# Neuropathic foot ulcers can occur in diabetic patients when loss of pain sensation and proprioception delays recognition of injury due to trauma, friction, or sustained pressure (on plantar surface of foot bones).

Xanthelasmas are dermal accumulations of benign-appearing macrophages with abundant, finely vacuolated (foamy) cytoplasm containing cholesterol (free and esterified), phospholipids, and triglycerides.  Due in part to insulin resistance promoting increased VLDL production, diabetics may develop a secondary Type IV or V hyperlipidemia (increased VLDL, chylomicrons) and/or a secondary diabetic dyslipidemia with elevated LDL cholesterol and low HDL cholesterol.

However, a serum lipid profile should be obtained next in order to establish the type of hyperlipidemia or dyslipidemia in this patient. $#(Choice F)#  Xanthelasmas are usually diagnosed based on clinical appearance.  Biopsy is not required.  Treatment is primarily medical and directed at the underlying lipid abnormality.  Surgical excision is not medically necessary, but may be undertaken electively for cosmetic reasons. $#Educational objective# Xanthelasmas, a type of xanthoma, are yellowish macules/papules found on the medial eyelids.

  "explanation_2": "This patient has signs of #panhypopituitarism# with failure of lactation, central hypothyroidism, and adrenal insufficiency.  In the setting of a recent delivery, this most likely represents #ischemic necrosis# of the #pituitary gland# (Sheehan syndrome).  During pregnancy, the pituitary enlarges due to estrogen-induced hyperplasia of the lactotrophs.  However, the blood supply to the pituitary does not increase proportionally.  As a result, the enlarged pituitary is vulnerable to ischemia in case of systemic hypotension due to #peripartum hemorrhage# (which this patient likely experienced given her low hemoglobin). $The most common manifestation of Sheehan syndrome is failure of lactation due to prolactin deficiency.  It also commonly causes hypocortisolism and hypothyroidism.  Manifestations of thyroid deficiency may take a few weeks to develop due to the long circulating half-life of thyroxine (5-7 days) and peripheral conversion of thyroxine (T4) to T3.  Cortisol deficiency manifests rapidly, however, with nausea, postural hypotension, fatigue, and weight loss. $#(Choice A)#  Pituitary apoplexy is due to sudden hemorrhage into the pituitary, usually in the setting of a preexisting pituitary adenoma.  It usually presents with acute severe headache, ophthalmoplegia, and altered sensorium. $#(Choice B)#  Lymphocytic hypophysitis is the most common inflammatory condition of the pituitary and typically occurs during late pregnancy or the early postpartum period.  In contrast to Sheehan syndrome, the presentation is acute with severe headaches and visual field defects. $#(Choice D)#  Primary pituitary cancer is extremely rare, although the pituitary is prone to metastases due to its rich vascular supply.  These patients typically present with tumor mass effects (eg, headache, bitemporal hemianopsia). $#(Choice E)#  Non-malignant infiltrative lesions such as sarcoidosis and histiocytosis X mainly involve the suprasellar region, where they compress the hypothalamus and pituitary stalk.  This disrupts the normal hypothalamic dopaminergic suppression of prolactin secretion, leading to increased prolactin levels and possible galactorrhea.  Central diabetes insipidus may also be seen with resulting hypernatremia. $#Educational objective# High estrogen levels during pregnancy cause enlargement of the pituitary gland without a proportional increase in blood supply.  Peripartum hypotension can cause ischemic necrosis of the pituitary leading to panhypopituitarism (Sheehan syndrome).  Patients commonly develop failure of lactation due to deficiency of prolactin.

PAI usually results from autoimmune destruction of the bilateral adrenal cortex and is more likely to occur in patients with a personal or family #history of autoimmune disease# (eg, Hashimoto thyroiditis).  Because all 3 layers of the @adrenal cortex@ are affected, clinical manifestations result from a reduction in circulating mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, and androgens. $#Reduced aldosterone#, the principal mineralocorticoid in the body, leads to markedly decreased sodium absorption by the renal collecting tubule @principal cells@ with consequent retention of potassium (leading to #hyperkalemia#).  The decrease in total body sodium results in #hypovolemia# and #hypotension# that may lead to renal insufficiency.  The hypovolemia provides nonosmotic stimulus for #antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion#, which stimulates water retention and leads to #hyponatremia#. $Cortisol, the main glucocorticoid in the body, normally inhibits ADH secretion; therefore, #reduced cortisol# further contributes to hyponatremia.  Cortisol is also necessary for the synthesis of epinephrine in the adrenal medulla; the consequent reduction in circulating epinephrine leads to a compensatory #increase in norepinephrine# to increase vascular tone in an effort to maintain blood pressure. $#(Choice B)#  Increased ADH and normal levels of cortisol, aldosterone, and norepinephrine occur in the syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH).  SIADH presents with hyponatremia, but it does not explain this patient's hyperkalemia, salt craving, and orthostatic symptoms. $#(Choices C, D, and E)#  Elevations in aldosterone, ADH, and norepinephrine occur in conditions that decrease effective arterial blood volume and renal perfusion (eg, heart failure, cirrhosis, dehydration).  Cortisol levels are often elevated in dehydration and heart failure; total cortisol is low in cirrhosis due to reduced cortisol-binding protein levels. $#(Choice F)#  Increased cortisol with reduced levels of aldosterone, ADH, and norepinephrine can occur with ectopic ACTH production (eg, due to small cell lung cancer).  Aldosterone synthesis is mostly independent of ACTH and is suppressed because cortisol and other glucocorticoids have some mineralocorticoid activity.  Levels of ADH and norepinephrine are also generally suppressed. $#Educational objective# Primary adrenal insufficiency usually involves autoimmune destruction of the bilateral adrenal cortex.  Reduced aldosterone production leads to renal salt wasting with hypovolemia, hypotension, and hyperkalemia.

Presumably, this patient died from a complication of advanced atherosclerosis, such as a myocardial infarction.  His father's similar fate at a young age suggests a familial condition, most likely familial hypercholesterolemia.  Familial hypercholesterolemia is one of the most common inherited disorders, and results from autosomal dominant mutations of the LDL receptor gene. $The liver LDL receptor is normally the greatest contributor to the removal of cholesterol-containing IDL and LDL particles from the circulation.  Although numerous other cell types, including smooth muscle cells, adrenocortical cells, fibroblasts, and lymphocytes also express high-affinity LDL receptors, approximately 70% of the plasma LDL is normally cleared by the liver.  Heterozygotes with one mutant LDL receptor gene have a 2- to 3-fold elevation of plasma cholesterol from birth, due to reduced hepatic IDL and LDL uptake.  Homozygotes may have a 5- to 6-fold elevation.  In both heterozygotes and homozygotes, the progression of atherosclerosis with aging is accelerated.  Complications include coronary artery disease at an unusually young age, as was the case for the patient in the vignette. $#(Choices A, B, D, E and F) #Although many cell types express the LDL receptor, their rate of LDL uptake from the circulation is usually less than that of hepatocytes.

High-dose dexamethasone suppresses ACTH and cortisol secretion when Cushing syndrome is caused by a pituitary adenoma (Cushing disease) but not when it is caused by ectopic ACTH secretion (eg, small cell lung cancer).

  "explanation_2": "@Deficiency of 21-hydroxylase@ is the most common form of #congenital adrenal hyperplasia# and leads to impaired conversion of 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) to 11-deoxycortisol.  Excess 17-OHP is shunted away from cortisol synthesis toward androgen production.  #ACTH increases# due to the decline in cortisol levels and has a trophic effect on adrenal cortical cells, causing #adrenal cortical hyperplasia#. $Depending on the residual enzyme activity, 21-hydroxylase deficiency can present as 3 distinct clinical syndromes of differing severity.  This patient most likely has the #classic, non–salt-wasting# (ie, simple virilizing) form of the disease.  Because 21-hydroxylase is not completely absent (as in the most severe form), sufficient mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids are maintained to avoid salt wasting such that patients have normal blood pressure and electrolytes.  Due to #adrenal androgen overproduction#, girls with this variant are often identified at birth due to ambiguous genitalia.  #Boys# appear normal at birth and typically present around #age 2-4# with #early virilization# (eg, body odor, pubic/axillary hair).  Exposure to high levels of sex hormones also induces an early pubertal growth spurt that manifests as #accelerated linear growth# at a young age. $In all forms of 21-hydroxylase deficiency, patients have #increased 17-OHP# and androgen levels.  Adrenal androgens (eg, dehydroepiandrosterone and androstenedione) undergo peripheral conversion to testosterone, which explains this patient's #high testosterone# level. $#(Choice B)#  Adrenal medullary hyperplasia is a precursor lesion for pheochromocytoma characterized by increased catecholamine production.  Presenting signs include hypertension, tachycardia, and sweating (not virilization). $#(Choice C)#  Leydig cell tumors produce excess testosterone and can present with precocious puberty in young boys (eg, early testicular/phallic enlargement).  A testicular mass is typically palpated on examination. $#(Choice D)#  Production of excess LH and FSH by pituitary adenomas can lead to increased testosterone but not increased 17-OHP levels.  Pituitary adenomas producing excess ACTH can lead to excess adrenal androgen production; however, symptoms of excess cortisol production (Cushing syndrome) such as growth deceleration and weight gain would predominate. $#(Choice E)#  A seminoma is a testicular tumor most commonly found in adolescents and adults.  These tumors are derived from the seminiferous tubules and present with a testicular mass, not virilization and elevated testosterone. $#Educational objective# Deficiency of 21-hydroxylase causes adrenal cortical hyperplasia due to excess stimulation of the adrenal cortex by ACTH.

Kallmann syndrome results from a failure of GnRH-secreting neurons to migrate from their origin in the olfactory placode (situated outside the central nervous system) to their normal anatomic location in the hypothalamus.  Most often, the cause is a mutation in the KAL-1 gene or the fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 gene, which code for proteins required in this migration. $Patients with Kallmann syndrome classically have central hypogonadism and anosmia, although there may be other midline defects as well (eg, cleft lip or cleft palate).  Most often, these patients present with delayed puberty.  On physical examination, the testes are often just 1-2 mL in volume.  There is usually some pubic hair because adrenarche occurs normally. $In the United States, delayed puberty is defined as the absence or incomplete development of secondary sexual characteristics by age 14 in boys and by age 12 in girls.  Testicular enlargement is the first sign of puberty in boys, and breast enlargement is the first sign in girls.  The initiation of puberty and the maintenance of secondary sexual characteristics and fertility require the coordinated efforts of the hypothalamus, pituitary, and gonads.  Delayed puberty can result from a derangement anywhere in this axis. $#(Choices B, C, D, and E)#  These pathways represent @normal feedback loops@ between the testes and the hypothalamus and pituitary.

  "explanation_2": "This patient with a three month history of weight loss, abdominal pain, and fatigue developed cardiovascular collapse during a medical procedure (endoscopy), which suggests #chronic adrenal insufficiency# complicated by #acute adrenal crisis#.  Severe physiologic stress (eg, infection, medical procedures) normally induces increased glucocorticoid production; however, patients with adrenal insufficiency are unable to increase production.  Adrenal crisis (eg, hypotension, shock) is rapidly fatal if unrecognized. $Adrenal insufficiency can be caused by dysfunction of either the adrenal glands (primary) or pituitary (secondary).  This patient's concomitant #skin hyperpigmentation# is highly suggestive of chronic #primary adrenal insufficiency# (PAI), as the resulting cortisol deficiency leads to increased ACTH secretion.  ACTH is derived from proopiomelanocortin (POMC), the same prohormone from which melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) is derived.  Increased ACTH also leads to increased MSH secretion, which results in hyperpigmentation. $#Autoimmune adrenalitis# is the most common cause (>90%) of chronic PAI and occurs due to autoantibody formation, resulting in #atrophy of the bilateral adrenal glands#.  It can occur as an isolated disorder or in association with other autoimmune syndromes (eg, hypothyroidism, vitiligo). $#(Choice B)#  Bilateral adrenal hemorrhage (Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome [WFS]) can cause PAI and adrenal crisis but is typically seen acutely in the setting of bacterial sepsis (eg, Neisseria meningitidis).  However, hyperpigmentation occurs in chronic adrenal insufficiency and therefore would not be expected with WFS. $#(Choices C and D)#  Ischemic necrosis of the pituitary (Sheehan syndrome) most commonly occurs due to hypoperfusion of the enlarged pituitary gland during childbirth.  Acute pituitary hemorrhage (pituitary apoplexy) typically occurs in patients with pituitary adenomas.  These conditions can cause central (secondary) adrenal insufficiency; however, hyperpigmentation is not seen because ACTH levels are low, and POMC levels are not increased. $#(Choice E)#  A cortisol-producing adrenal tumor can cause contralateral adrenal atrophy due to suppression of ACTH secretion; however, it would not be associated with hyperpigmentation and would manifest as @hypercortisolism@ rather than adrenal insufficiency. $#Educational objective# Primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI) is characterized by weight loss, abdominal pain, fatigue, and hyperpigmentation.  Physiologic stress in patients with PAI can trigger acute adrenal crisis (eg, fever, shock, mental status changes).

  "explanation_2": "The patient described in this vignette has type 2 diabetes mellitus (advanced age, obesity, prolonged non-compliance with treatment without immediate life-threatening consequences).  The two cardinal defects involved in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus are increased insulin resistance and defective insulin secretion.  Although still controversial, many researchers believe that increased insulin resistance is the primary abnormality in type 2 diabetes mellitus.  Early in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, glucose tolerance is thought to remain normal because of a compensatory increase in insulin secretion from beta cells.  This compensatory insulin response by beta cells ultimately fails, causing poor glucose tolerance.  A number of genetic and acquired factors are implicated in the beta-cell dysregulation of type 2 diabetes.  Islet amyloid polypeptide (amylin) is one factor thought to be responsible for this beta cell dysfunction.  Amylin is stored in insulin secretory granules and is co-secreted with insulin from pancreatic beta cells.  Deposits of amylin are universally seen in the pancreatic islets of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  Amylin may play a causative role in beta cell apoptosis and defective insulin secretion; however, this theory is still controversial. $Type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus have very strong genetic components.  Twin studies have shown a concordance rate of 50% in identical twins for diabetes mellitus type 1, and around 80% for diabetes mellitus type 2.  The genes involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus type 2 remain largely unknown.  Gene polymorphism within the major histocompatibility complex contributes to type 1 diabetes mellitus disease in humans.  HLA-DQ and -DR are the most important determinants of type 1 diabetes mellitus.  In the general population, DR3 and DR4 are seen in approximately 40% of subjects; however, in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, DR3 and DR4 haplotypes are seen in more than 90% of subjects. $#(Choices A, C, D & E)  #These are features of type 1 diabetes mellitus.  Type 1 diabetes occurs when an autoimmune response is triggered by an environmental insult in genetically susceptible individuals.  Patients with type 2 diabetes retain at least some beta cell function, but patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus develop absolute deficiency of insulin secondary to immune destruction of pancreatic beta cells.  These patients need insulin for survival.  Discontinuation of insulin treatment results in ketoacidosis.  $#Educational objective# Pancreatic islet amyloid deposition is characteristic of type 2 diabetes mellitus.  A strong linkage with HLA class II gene makeup, pancreatic islet infiltration with leukocytes (insulitis), and antibodies against islet antigens are frequently seen in type 1 diabetes. "

Lymphocytic hypophysitis is an uncommon disorder that also occurs with increased frequency in postpartum women.  Both of these disorders can cause secondary/central hypothyroidism due to loss of pituitary thyrotrophs, which leads to low (not elevated) TSH. $#(Choice C)#  Like postpartum thyroiditis, subacute (postviral, granulomatous, De Quervain) thyroiditis also follows a phasic course with initial hyperthyroidism due to release of preformed hormone followed by a hypothyroid phase.  However, the thyroid is painful and tender, and fever is common because it is believed to be a postviral inflammatory process. $#Educational objective# Postpartum thyroiditis occurs within 12 months of pregnancy and is characterized by autoimmune destruction of thyroid follicles.

His hypertension, ecchymoses, and hyperpigmentation suggest #paraneoplastic hypercortisolism# (@Cushing syndrome@) due to #ectopic ACTH# secretion.  As with primary adrenal insufficiency, excess ACTH secretion leads to hyperpigmentation, likely due to co-secretion of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) (both ACTH and alpha-MSH are derived from pro-opiomelanocortin) and direct stimulation of the MC2R receptor on melanocytes by ACTH.  Although patients with paraneoplastic hypercortisolism may have many of the typical metabolic features of cortisol excess (eg, hypertension, hyperglycemia, edema), #weight loss# is more common than classic Cushingoid central obesity. $Paraneoplastic hypercortisolism is most commonly associated with small cell lung cancer but can also be seen with other neuroendocrine tumors (eg, bronchial or pancreatic carcinoid).  ACTH secreted by small cell lung cancer is not inhibited by high-dose exogenous corticosteroids (eg, dexamethasone), whereas pituitary ACTH secretion decreases via negative feedback. $#(Choice B)#  Cortisol is produced by the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex, and autonomous cortisol production (ie, ACTH-independent hypercortisolism) is almost always due to a primary adrenal disorder (eg, adrenal adenoma).  Regardless of the source, excess cortisol in a patient with intact hypothalamus-pituitary function suppresses ACTH and patients do not develop hyperpigmentation. $#(Choice C)#  Given this patient's large lung mass and associated weight loss (instead of weight gain and central fat deposition), paraneoplastic ACTH secretion is more likely than an ACTH-producing pituitary adenoma (Cushing disease). $#(Choice D)#  Metastasis to the hypothalamus would likely cause endocrine insufficiency resulting from a lack of trophic hormones to the anterior pituitary.  Decreased production of corticotropin-releasing hormone would lead to central adrenal insufficiency, not hypercortisolism. $#(Choice E)#  The adrenal glands are a common site of metastasis.  If significant destruction of the adrenal cortical tissue occurs bilaterally, adrenal insufficiency may result.  A subsequent increase of ACTH may cause hyperpigmentation; however, symptoms of adrenal insufficiency (eg, hypotension) would be expected, as opposed to the symptoms of cortisol excess seen in this patient. $#Educational objective# Paraneoplastic hypercortisolism, most commonly caused by small cell lung cancer, is due to ectopic ACTH secretion.  Clinical features include hypertension, hyperglycemia, edema, and hyperpigmentation.  Unlike nonparaneoplastic Cushing syndrome, central obesity is uncommon. ",

It usually occurs following trauma or can occur spontaneously in patients with chronic hypertension, connective tissue disease, or history of smoking. $#(Choice D)#  Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) due to rupture of a saccular aneurysm near the optic chiasm can present similarly to pituitary apoplexy.  However, SAH is usually associated with hypertension due to sympathetic activation, and it is unusual for an aneurysm to cause both bilateral visual field defects (compression of the optic chiasm) and ophthalmoplegia (compression of the CN III or trochlear nerve [CN IV]).  This patient's chronic history of decreased libido followed by acute cardiovascular collapse is more suggestive of a pituitary etiology. $#(Choice E)#  Cavernous sinus thrombosis is most common in patients with underlying thrombophilia, pregnancy, oral contraceptive use, malignancy, or infection.  Presenting features include progressively worse headaches, vomiting, seizures, and oculomotor deficits (similar to pituitary mass compression).  However, chronically decreased libido, bitemporal hemianopsia, and sudden death from hypotension would be unusual. $#Educational objective# Acute pituitary hemorrhage (pituitary apoplexy) is characterized by severe headache, bitemporal hemianopsia (compression of the optic chiasm), and ophthalmoplegia (compression of the oculomotor nerve [CN III]).

Patients with gastrinomas can also have diarrhea and abdominal pain. $#(Choice D)#  Excess somatostatin secretion from a somatostatinoma typically presents with abdominal pain, gallbladder stones, constipation, hyperglycemia, and steatorrhea.  These manifestations result from somatostatin-induced inhibition of insulin, glucagon, gastrin, secretin, and cholecystokinin secretion, and inhibition of gastrointestinal motility. $#(Choice E)#  High levels of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) are seen in patients with a VIPoma, which typically presents with intractable diarrhea, hypokalemia, and achlorhydria.  Patients are usually hypotensive due to dehydration and the vasodilatory effects of VIP. $#(Choice F)#  Diabetes mellitus is present in the majority of patients with glucagonoma, most likely due to excessive hepatic glucose production.  Insulin levels tend to be normal but can be elevated secondary to hyperglycemia and glucagon-induced stimulation of the pancreatic beta cells. $#(Choice G)#  Zinc deficiency causes erythematous skin lesions (mainly around body orifices) that are predominantly vesicular and pustular.  Other features include hypogonadism, impaired taste and smell, night blindness, and impaired wound healing.  Although the skin lesions in zinc deficiency can resemble necrolytic migratory erythema, this patient's lack of additional findings and her recent diabetes mellitus diagnosis make glucagonoma more likely. $#Educational objective# Glucagonoma presents with hyperglycemia (often as newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus) and necrolytic migratory erythema (blistering erythematous plaques with central clearing) affecting the groin, face, and extremities.

Tobacco use, especially smoking, is the single most preventable cause of death and disease in the United States.  In addition to its numerous direct adverse effects, tobacco smoking also substantially increases the risk for macrovascular (eg, myocardial infarction [MI], stroke) and microvascular (eg, retinopathy, nephropathy) complications of diabetes mellitus.  These complications significantly increase mortality, primarily by increasing the risk of MI.  The risk of MI-associated mortality begins to decrease immediately upon smoking cessation.  However, it takes several tobacco-free years before the risk returns to baseline, especially in patients with a long history of smoking.  In addition, smokers with diabetes have a higher likelihood of developing hypercholesterolemia, poor glycemic control, and end-stage renal disease.  It appears that smoking not only worsens the complications of diabetes but also increases the likelihood of developing diabetes in the first place, thus highlighting the importance of prevention and early cessation. $#(Choice A)#  Fecal occult blood testing screens for colorectal cancer and improves mortality through earlier detection.  Even so, the mortality benefit is much lower than that achieved by smoking cessation. $#(Choice B)#  Prostate-specific antigen is increased in some patients with prostate cancer.

The activated complex then binds to the transcriptional regulatory sequences to upregulate target genes that enhance insulin sensitivity, including: $#Glucose transporter-4#, an insulin-responsive, transmembrane glucose transporter expressed in adipocytes and skeletal myocytes that increases glucose uptake by target cells $#Adiponectin#, a cytokine secreted by fat tissue that increases the number of insulin-responsive adipocytes and stimulates fatty acid oxidation #(choice B)# $TZDs are functionally similar to fibrate medications (eg, fenofibrate, gemfibrozil), which bind PPAR-α and are effective in lowering blood triglyceride levels.

The increased movement of free fatty acids into fat cells, along with increased fatty acid oxidation (adiponectin effect), causes circulating free fatty acid levels to decrease. $#(Choice D)#  TZDs do not stimulate insulin secretion; rather, as insulin resistance diminishes, circulating levels of insulin tend to decrease over time. $#(Choice E)#  Leptin is a hormone secreted by fat cells that acts on the hypothalamus to decrease appetite.  Although PPAR-γ activation increases fat cell mass, circulating leptin levels remain unchanged or decrease due to the inhibiting effect of PPAR-γ on leptin gene transcription. $#Educational objective# Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) activate peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor gamma, a nuclear receptor that alters the transcription of genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism.  The resulting decrease in insulin resistance lowers blood glucose and can help reverse nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.  "

  "explanation_2": "$The beta cells of the pancreas produce #basal insulin# continuously at a low level to suppress on-going hepatic gluconeogenesis.  After meals, insulin secretion increases briefly to control the #postprandial# rise in blood glucose.  Commercial insulin analogues with different pharmacokinetics can be given subcutaneously to replicate physiologic insulin secretion: $• #Long-acting insulins# (eg, glargine) mimic basal insulin secretion; they have an extended duration of action and little or no peak effect.  They are typically given once daily and suppress #fasting hyperglycemia,# which is predominantly caused by inappropriate hepatic gluconeogenesis. $• #Rapid-acting insulins# (eg, lispro, aspart) are given to mimic the effects of postprandial insulin; they #peak quickly# and are then rapidly cleared.  They are given prior to meals so that the peak effect coincides with postmeal glucose excursions; they control #postprandial hyperglycemia#.  Because they are quickly cleared, they have minimal effect on fasting glucose levels. $This patient has normal fasting glucose levels, suggesting that his long-acting basal insulin regimen is appropriate but that he has elevated postprandial glucose.  His postprandial hyperglycemia is best treated with a #rapid-acting premeal insulin analogue#, such as #aspart#, lispro, or glulisine.  Regular insulin also can be given before mealtimes but has a more delayed peak onset and a longer duration of action compared to rapid-acting insulin analogues (which have amino acid changes that accelerate hexamer dissociation compared to regular insulin). $#(Choices B, C, and D)#  Insulins @degludec, detemir, and glargine@ have long durations of action due to structural modifications (eg, polymerizing residues, fatty acid side chains) that delay absorption and distribution.  They have minimal peak effect and are used as basal insulin substitutes. $#(Choice E)#  @NPH@, an intermediate-acting crystalline suspension of insulin with zinc/protamine, can be given twice daily when used as basal insulin.  However, unlike other basal insulins, it has a noticeable peak effect and can lead to hypoglycemia if the peak does not correspond to a meal (eg, nocturnal hypoglycemia), making it a less preferable option for this use. $#Educational objective# Long-acting insulin analogues (eg, glargine) have an extended duration of action without a noticeable peak in activity and are typically given once daily to mimic basal insulin secretion.  Rapid-acting insulins (eg, aspart, lispro) are quickly absorbed from the injection site and are given at mealtimes to replicate postprandial insulin secretion.  ",

Prostate cancer is an #androgen-dependent# tumor.  Because most androgens (eg, testosterone) in men are made in the Leydig cells of the testes, initial treatment focuses on a systemic reduction in androgen production via surgical or medical #orchiectomy#. $Androgen production is primarily regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis.  Neurons in the hypothalamus release #GnRH# into the hypothalamic-pituitary portal system in a #pulsatile pattern# every 90-120 minutes.  This stimulates pituitary gonadotrophs to release luteinizing hormone (#LH#) into the circulation, which then binds to a surface receptor on Leydig cells and stimulates androgen production. $In medical orchiectomy, a #GnRH analogue# (eg, #leuprolide#) is administered to continuously stimulate pituitary gonadotrophs, which leads to down-regulation of the GnRH receptor, lower LH release, and reduced testicular androgen production.  However, because GnRH analogues #initially stimulate# pituitary gonadotrophs prior to the down-regulation of the receptor, most patients have a #transient increase in systemic androgens# during the first week of therapy (upward portion of graph).  This effect is generally blunted by administering a short course of androgen receptor antagonist medication (eg, bicalutamide) during treatment initiation in order to prevent worsening of the underlying prostate cancer. $#(Choices A and C)#  GnRH analogues stimulate the GnRH receptor prior to down-regulation, resulting in a transient increase in LH and systemic androgen production prior to down-regulation of the receptor. $#(Choice D)#  The enzyme 5-alpha reductase converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in peripheral tissues (eg, skin, liver); as testosterone levels fall, DHT production will decrease concurrently.  GnRH analogues have no effect on the activity of 5-alpha reductase, therefore, testosterone and DHT levels rise and fall in synchrony following GnRH administration. $#(Choice E)#  Benign prostatic hyperplasia is typically treated with a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor (eg, finasteride), which reduces the conversion of testosterone to DHT.  This class of medications reduces DHT levels while testosterone levels remain largely unaffected. $#Educational objective# Leuprolide is a GnRH agonist used to treat prostate cancer.  It initially stimulates pituitary LH secretion, which leads to a rise in androgen levels.  However, the GnRH receptor is subsequently down-regulated, which dramatically drops LH release and leads to a long-term decrease in androgen production.  "

Sulfonylureas do not have a significant effect on vitamin B12 metabolism. $#(Choice E)#  SGLT2 inhibitors (eg, dapagliflozin) decrease renal reabsorption of glucose, leading to increased urinary glucose loss and lower blood glucose levels.  The excess glucose in the urine can increase the risk of urinary tract infections and vulvovaginal candidiasis. $#Educational objective# Sulfonylureas inhibit the ATP-sensitive potassium channel on the pancreatic beta cell membrane, inducing depolarization and L-type calcium channel opening.  The increased Ca2+ influx stimulates beta cell insulin release independent of blood glucose concentrations, increasing the risk of hypoglycemia when meals are missed or during exercise.  "

To prevent injury, counterregulatory systems raise blood glucose in response to hypoglycemia via sympathetic nervous system activation (ie, norepinephrine/#epinephrine# release) and increase secretion of #glucagon#, cortisol, and growth hormone. $Symptoms of hypoglycemia fall into 2 general categories: neurogenic (autonomic) and neuroglycopenic. $• #Neurogenic symptoms# are mediated via norepinephrine/epinephrine and acetylcholine release during sympathetic stimulation.  Symptoms due to #norepinephrine/epinephrine# include tremulousness, tachycardia, and anxiety/arousal, whereas #acetylcholine# causes sweating, hunger, and paresthesias. $• #Neuroglycopenic symptoms# are due to inadequate availability of glucose in the CNS and include behavioral changes, confusion, visual disturbances, stupor, and seizures. $This patient has #reduced awareness# of hypoglycemia, likely due to the use of a #nonselective beta blocker# (eg, propranolol) for chronic treatment of migraines and/or hypertension.  Nonselective beta blockers attenuate the norepinephrine/epinephrine-mediated symptoms of hypoglycemia, but cholinergic symptoms (eg, hunger) are unaffected.

When administered in a pulsatile fashion (eg, intermittent intravenous infusion), leuprolide has GnRH agonist properties; however, #chronic administration# (eg, depot injection) results in a @continuous GnRH effect@ that leads to downregulation of GnRH receptors on gonadotropin cells in the pituitary gland.  This suppresses pituitary LH release and leads to #reduced# production of #testosterone# by Leydig cells.  Lower levels of circulating testosterone produce a clinical effect similar to that of surgical orchiectomy. $In male patients, androgens (eg, testosterone) are #aromatized to estrogens# that preserve bone density by reducing expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B (RANK) on @osteoclast precursors@ and inducing production of osteoprotegerin (decoy receptor that opposes RANK-ligand) by osteoblasts.

Conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (ie, 25-hydroxycholecalciferol) to its active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, by 1-alpha-hydroxylase (stimulated by PTH) occurs in the kidneys; this is one reason that patients with chronic kidney disease are at increased risk for osteoporosis.  However, the vitamin D–PTH axis is not significantly influenced by leuprolide. $#(Choice E)#  Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM) is a paraneoplastic syndrome due to release of PTH-related protein (PTHrP) by malignant cells.  PTHrP is structurally similar to PTH and acts on the PTH-1 receptor.  HHM is most commonly seen in squamous cell carcinoma (eg, lung), transitional cell carcinomas, and breast and ovarian cancers.

Dopamine antagonists (eg, antipsychotics) directly increase prolactin secretion and also can worsen galactorrhea. $#(Choice B)#  Hyperprolactinemia causes amenorrhea in women due to the inhibitory effect of prolactin on hypothalamic GnRH release.  Dopaminergic medications suppress prolactin secretion and can restore normal GnRH secretion. $#(Choice E)#  Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulates secretion of prolactin by lactotrophs, although its role in regulating prolactin release is secondary to the inhibition of prolactin secretion by dopamine.  Factors that increase TRH release would worsen hyperprolactinemia. $#Educational objective# Galactorrhea is abnormal secretion of breast milk not associated with pregnancy or breastfeeding.  It is most commonly due to excess prolactin, as seen in prolactin-secreting pituitary adenomas.  Prolactin is under negative regulation by hypothalamic dopaminergic neurons, and dopamine agonists can be used to treat hyperprolactinemia.  ",

There it can cause significant tissue damage that may result in radiation-induced hypothyroidism and #thyroid carcinoma# (particularly in younger patients).  In the event of a nuclear accident, #potassium iodide# is given prophylactically to protect the thyroid from excessive accumulation of radioactive 131I. $Energy-dependent transport of inorganic iodide into the thyroid follicular cell (iodide trapping) is accomplished by the sodium-iodide symporter located on the basolateral membrane.  Because this transporter takes up all isotopes of iodide (as well as other ions such as perchlorate and pertechnetate), high serum levels of nonradioactive iodide can #competitively inhibit# radioactive I131 from entering thyroid follicular cells.  Large increases in serum iodide levels also inhibit iodine organification (Wolff-Chaikoff effect) and reduce thyroid hormone release. $#(Choice A)#  Levothyroxine is a synthetic form of T4 used to treat hypothyroidism.  High doses of levothyroxine suppress TSH, just as high amounts of natural T4 would.  Because TSH stimulates iodine trapping, high doses of levothyroxine would ultimately reduce iodine uptake in the thyroid follicular cells.

  "explanation_2": "$Estrogens are synthesized primarily by the aromatization of androgens.  #Aromatase# belongs to the P450 superfamily and is highly expressed in #ovarian tissue# (in which expression is #gonadotropin dependent#).  Aromatase is also expressed in the adrenal cortex, subcutaneous fat, and breast.  In the postmenopausal state, follicular atresia leads to reduced numbers of granulosa cells and decreased ovarian estrogen synthesis.  However, the ovaries and adrenal glands continue to produce androgens in significant quantities, and #extraovarian aromatase# maintains a low level of estrogen in the peripheral circulation. $Estrogen is the main hormone driving the growth and development of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive malignant breast tumors.  #Aromatase inhibitors# (eg, anastrozole, letrozole, exemestane) reduce the synthesis of estrogen from androgens, suppressing estrogen levels in postmenopausal women and #slowing progression of ER-positive tumors#.  They are less effective as monotherapy in premenopausal women, as ovarian aromatase is upregulated substantially in response to gonadotropins. $#(Choice B)#  Although inhibition of androgen synthesis could theoretically decrease estrogen synthesis, most androgen synthesis inhibitors (eg, ketoconazole) are nonspecific and suppress other pathways of steroidogenesis (eg, cortisol, mineralocorticoid). $#(Choice C)#  Pulsatile stimulation of the pituitary by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) increases secretion of LH and FSH.  However, continuous GnRH stimulation by long-acting GnRH analogs (eg, goserelin) suppresses LH and FSH release, decreasing production of estrogens in the ovarian follicle.  These agents are useful for ovarian suppression in premenopausal women with ER-positive breast cancer. $#(Choice D)#  Tamoxifen acts as either an antagonist or a partial agonist of the estrogen receptor, depending on the tissue.  In breast tissue, tamoxifen antagonizes the estrogen receptor and can be used as adjuvant therapy for ER-positive breast cancer. $#(Choice E)#  Many breast cancers overexpress epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2).  Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody against HER2 that is used in patients with HER2-positive tumors.  It inhibits MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways, increases degradation of HER2, and facilitates antibody-mediated destruction of tumor cells. $#Educational objective# Estrogen is the main hormone responsible for the growth and development of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast tumors.  Aromatase inhibitors (eg, anastrozole, letrozole, exemestane) decrease the synthesis of estrogen from androgens, suppressing estrogen levels and slowing progression of ER-positive tumors.  "

  "explanation_2": "This patient has a sore throat, fever, and pharyngeal ulcers.  Although this constellation of symptoms often occurs as a consequence of viral upper respiratory tract infection, the recent initiation of antithyroid medication for #Graves disease# should raise strong suspicion for #drug-induced neutropenia#. $Patients with Graves disease are often treated initially with thionamide medications such as #methimazole# or #propylthiouracil# (PTU) to achieve a euthyroid state prior to radioiodine therapy or surgery.  However, these medications cause #severe neutropenia# (absolute neutrophil count <500/mm3) in approximately 1 in 200 individuals.  This side effect of therapy is thought to occur due to the interaction of the thionamide with reactive oxidative products (eg, myeloperoxidase, hydrogen peroxide), leading to generation of drug metabolites (eg, propyl thioester, sulfonic acid) that covalently attach to the neutrophil surface.  Antibodies then form against these new antigens (haptens), resulting in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. $Drug-induced neutropenia most often presents with #oropharyngeal ulcers# and #fever# (ie, mucus membrane infection).  Laboratory evaluation usually shows isolated leukopenia (eg, no anemia or thrombocytopenia).  Because patients with drug-induced neutropenia are at risk for #severe infections#, the offending drug should be immediately #discontinued#.  This usually resolves the neutropenia within 1-3 weeks. $#(Choice A)#  Patients with autoimmune thyroid disease (eg, Graves disease) are at risk for other autoimmune endocrinopathies, including adrenal insufficiency.  However, acute adrenal insufficiency typically presents with refractory hypotension, vomiting, abdominal pain, and weakness.  Pharyngitis would be atypical. $#(Choice C)#  Excessive suppression of thyroid function by antithyroid drugs can lead to a hypothyroid state, which can present with fatigue.  However, patients with hypothyroidism demonstrate weight gain, not weight loss; other symptoms (eg, cold intolerance, hair and skin changes) are also usually present. $#(Choice D)#  Undertreatment of this patient's hyperthyroidism could result in a residual hyperthyroid state (ie, thyroid hormone–induced severe hypermetabolism), which can present with fever, tachycardia, and dehydration.  However, hypertension and tremor would likely be present; pharyngeal infection is unexpected. $#(Choice E)#  Several viral infections (eg, HIV) can cause virus-induced lymphocyte destruction.  Although the loss of lymphocytes from viral infection can lead to pharyngeal infection, the presence of fever and pharyngitis shortly after initiation of antithyroid medication is more suggestive of drug-induced neutropenia. $#Educational objective# Drug-induced neutropenia is the major side effect of the first-line medications used to treat Graves disease.  Initial manifestations usually include fever and oropharyngeal ulcers.  "

Metoclopramide, a dopamine 2 receptor antagonist, can improve symptoms but is occasionally associated with extrapyramidal side effects (eg, dystonia) and tardive dyskinesia (eg, involuntary movements). $For patients with gastroparesis who cannot tolerate metoclopramide, #erythromycin#, a macrolide antibiotic, can be used as an alternate prokinetic agent.  The prokinetic effects of erythromycin stem from the #activation of the motilin receptor# in the smooth muscle of the upper digestive tract, which results in coordinated peristaltic contractions that begin in the stomach and move through the entire upper digestive system (thereby propelling food into the colon). $When used as an antibiotic, erythromycin can cause significant abdominal cramping, but in the setting of gastroparesis, the prokinetic effects can be leveraged to improve gastric emptying and ameliorate gastroparesis symptoms.  However, the agonist effects of erythromycin diminish over time# #(tachyphylaxis) so it is generally used for short periods (<4 weeks). $#(Choices B and C)#  Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) who have significant gastrointestinal bloating symptoms can be treated with antispasmodic medications (eg, dicycloverine) that block gastrointestinal muscarinic receptors.  Those with constipation-predominant IBS are sometimes treated with lubiprostone, a chloride channel activator, to increase intestinal fluid secretion.  IBS is usually marked by periods of diarrhea and/or constipation and abdominal bloating; early satiety and vomiting of undigested food would be atypical. $#(Choice D)#  Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is treated with medications (eg, proton pump inhibitor, sucralfate) that have a protective effect on the gastrointestinal mucosa.  Although PUD can occasionally cause nausea, vomiting, and early satiety due to gastric outlet obstruction, most patients have significant upper abdominal pain.  In addition, an EGD would show a gastric or duodenal ulcer. $#(Choice E)#  Patients with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)—colonization of the small intestine with colonic bacteria—often develop bloating, abdominal discomfort, flatulence, and/or diarrhea.  However, early satiety and vomiting of undigested food would be atypical.  In addition, SIBO is generally treated with rifaximin or neomycin. $#Educational objective# Erythromycin stimulates upper gastrointestinal motility by acting as an agonist on motilin receptors in the muscularis externa.

After acute management (eg, intravenous fluids and insulin infusion), he needs to transition to chronic (subcutaneous) insulin therapy. $A variety of commercial insulin analogues with different pharmacokinetics are available; the ideal regimen mimics normal insulin secretion using separate injections of the following: $• #Long-acting insulins# (eg, #glargine#) mimic continuous, steady-level #basal# insulin secretion by the pancreas that suppresses hepatic gluconeogenesis; they have an extended duration of action and #little or no peak# effect.

They are given multiple times daily, just before each meal, so that the peak effect coincides with postprandial glucose surges. $#(Choice A)#  Insulin aspart alone can replicate postprandial insulin secretion but does not provide a basal insulin effect. $#(Choices B and C)#  Insulins detemir and glargine are long-acting basal insulins without significant peak effects; because of detemir's shorter duration of action (ie, <24 hr), it is sometimes given twice daily to ensure 24-hour coverage.  These medications do not treat postprandial hyperglycemia. $#(Choice E)#  NPH is an intermediate-acting insulin; it can be used as a basal insulin if given twice daily to provide 24-hour coverage.  Unlike physiologic basal insulin secretions, NPH has a significant peak effect that increases the risk for hypoglycemia.  In addition, premixing with regular insulin does not easily allow for premeal bolus adjustments.  Therefore, a combined formulation of NPH and regular insulin (usually in a 70/30 ratio) is less representative of physiologic insulin secretion compared to separate injections of basal and rapid-acting premeal insulin. $#Educational objective# Physiologic insulin secretion can be approximated by separate administrations of long-acting and rapid-acting insulin analogues.  Long-acting preparations (eg, glargine) replicate basal insulin secretion, whereas premeal, rapid-acting insulin (eg, lispro) replicates meal-related insulin surges.  "

  "explanation_2": "$#Metformin# lowers blood glucose by decreasing hepatic gluconeogenesis and increasing insulin-dependent peripheral glucose uptake.  It functions by inhibiting mitochondrial @glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase@, which #reduces# availability of #gluconeogenesis substrates# (eg, glycerol, lactate).  Metformin also upregulates AMP-activated protein kinase, which inhibits lipogenesis and subsequently lowers circulating lipid levels. $Metformin is the preferred first-line medication for type 2 diabetes mellitus.  It does not increase endogenous insulin secretion and therefore carries a #low risk of hypoglycemia#.  In addition, it also leads to #modest weight loss# in most patients. $However, the inhibition of gluconeogenesis by metformin results in @increased lactate@ production.  Patients with significant renal dysfunction or other disorders that reduce lactate clearance (eg, hepatic impairment) are at risk for metformin-induced #lactic acidosis#.  For this reason, the glomerular filtration rate should be estimated using #serum creatinine measurement# prior to the initiation of metformin. $#(Choice A)#  Metformin can cause vitamin B12 deficiency (leading to macrocytic anemia), likely due to decreased intestinal absorption.  However, this is a chronic effect seen after long-term use, and pretreatment testing is not needed. $#(Choice B)#  The oral glucose tolerance test is used for the initial diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, primarily gestational diabetes.  This patient's diagnosis has been confirmed with elevated fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1c; additional diagnostic testing is not necessary. $#(Choice C)#  Plasma lactate levels are used to confirm acute lactic acidosis; measurement of a baseline level is not useful. $#(Choice E)#  Monitoring serum potassium is not necessary with metformin use.  Serum potassium is routinely monitored with diuretics (especially loop diuretics), spironolactone, ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor blockers. $#(Choice F)#  Thyroid function tests routinely performed in patients taking lithium and amiodarone but are not required for antidiabetic medications, including metformin. $#Educational objective# Metformin lowers blood glucose by reducing hepatic gluconeogenesis and increasing insulin-dependent peripheral glucose uptake.  Lactic acidosis is a rare complication of metformin therapy; the risk is increased in patients with underlying renal insufficiency.  ",

Adverse effects include delayed gastric emptying and a possible increased risk for pancreatitis. $#(Choice B)#  Thiazolidinediones (eg, pioglitazone) increase the reabsorption of sodium in the renal collecting tubule; this can lead to significant fluid retention, particularly in patients with heart failure.

Medication-induced body fat redistribution (sometimes called #lipoatrophy# or #lipodystrophy#) is a common adverse effect of #highly-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)# and can be considered a product of 2 independent processes: wasting of fat from the face and extremities and deposition of fat in the trunk and viscera.  $1. #Lipoatrophy# refers to loss of subcutaneous fat, especially from the @face@, extremities, and buttocks.  It is primarily seen in patients taking nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (mainly stavudine and zidovudine) and is also associated with protease inhibitor use.  $2. #Central fat deposition# also occurs in some patients and causes increased abdominal girth and a buffalo hump (dorsocervical fat accumulation) that is similar to Cushing syndrome.

  "explanation_2": "This patient has symptomatic hypoglycemia following initiation of a #sulfonylurea# medication (ie, glipizide) for diabetes mellitus.  Sulfonylureas #inhibit# the ATP-sensitive #potassium channel# on the pancreatic beta cell membrane, inducing depolarization with opening of L-type calcium channels (ie, increased Ca2+ influx), #stimulating insulin release#.  Sulfonylurea-induced stimulation of beta cells is #independent of blood glucose# and occurs even when blood glucose levels are normal, increasing the risk for hypoglycemia. $The #risk for hypoglycemia# associated with sulfonylureas is increased in the setting of skipped meals (as in this patient), in excessively high medication doses, and with concurrent renal or hepatic disease (which decreases drug metabolism and clearance).  Although hypoglycemia can occur with any sulfonylurea medication, the risk is highest with longer-acting sulfonylureas (eg, glyburide). $#(Choice A)#  Metformin inhibits the mitochondrial enzymes required for gluconeogenesis, leading to decreased hepatic glucose production and lower circulating glucose levels.  It also increases peripheral glucose uptake and improves insulin sensitivity by activating AMP-activated protein kinase.  Metformin does not increase endogenous insulin secretion and therefore is not associated with hypoglycemia. $#(Choice B)#  Thiazolidinediones (eg, pioglitazone) decrease insulin resistance by binding to peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor gamma, a transcriptional regulator of genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism. $#(Choice D)#  Glucagon-like polypeptide-1 (GLP-1) is secreted by the intestine in response to food intake and slows gastric emptying and increases glucose-dependent insulin release.  GLP-1 agonists (eg, exenatide) act through cell surface receptors that are coupled with a G protein–adenylyl cyclase system.  Because the effects of GLP-1 agonists are glucose dependent (eg, occur primarily in the presence of food), these medications are not typically associated with hypoglycemia. $#(Choice E)#  Insulin acts by binding to a cell surface receptor consisting of 2 alpha and 2 beta subunits.  The alpha subunits are located extracellularly and provide binding sites for insulin.  The membrane-spanning beta subunits contain the intracellular tyrosine kinase domains. $#Educational objective# Sulfonylureas inhibit the ATP-sensitive potassium channel on the pancreatic beta cell membrane, inducing depolarization Ca2+ influx, and insulin release independent of blood glucose concentrations.  Sulfonylureas can induce hypoglycemia because they stimulate insulin secretion even when blood glucose levels are normal.  "

Because of increased renal glucose excretion, patients typically experience a mild reduction in weight (often desirable) but may be at increased risk for genitourinary infections (eg, vaginal candidiasis). $#(Choice B)#  SGLT-2 inhibitors may decrease (not increase) bone density, possibly because decreased sodium reabsorption is associated with increased phosphate reabsorption in the proximal tubule, resulting in increased parathyroid hormone secretion and, subsequently, increased bone resorption. $#(Choice C)#  Thiazolidinediones (eg, pioglitazone) are antidiabetic medications associated with fluid retention.

In addition, they do not increase pancreatic insulin secretion, further reducing the risk for hypoglycemia. $#Educational objective# Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (eg, canagliflozin, dapagliflozin) decrease renal reabsorption of glucose and sodium.

She also has increased 24-hour urine excretion of cortisol and an elevated serum cortisol level that is not suppressed by low-dose dexamethasone, which confirm the diagnosis of @Cushing syndrome@.  In addition, her ACTH level is elevated (ACTH-dependent Cushing syndrome), which is most commonly due to an ACTH-secreting corticotroph pituitary adenoma (#Cushing disease#). $Initially, #excess ACTH# rapidly acts to increase adrenal blood flow and metabolic activity, primarily within the zona fasciculata and reticularis.

Increased pregnenolone availability results in #increased cortisol synthesis# within the zona fasciculata and #increased androgen production# within the zona reticularis (can lead to irregular menstruation, hirsutism).  ACTH also has a trophic (growth) effect on the #zona fasciculata and reticularis#; as time passes, high levels of ACTH upregulate RNA and protein synthesis and induce cellular proliferation (#hyperplasia#). $#(Choice A)#  Although increased ACTH can have a transient effect on aldosterone production, angiotensin II is the primary trophic hormone for the zona glomerulosa.  Adenoma or nodular hyperplasia of the zona glomerulosa can be associated with increased secretion of mineralocorticoids (primary hyperaldosteronism [Conn syndrome]), which presents with hypertension and hypokalemia (muscle weakness). $#(Choice B)#  Atrophy of the entire adrenal cortex is most commonly caused by autoimmune adrenalitis and presents with chronic adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease).  There is a compensatory rise in ACTH secretion, but, unlike in this patient, urine cortisol excretion is not elevated. $#(Choices C and E)#  Pheochromocytoma is a catecholamine-secreting tumor derived from the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla.  Adrenal medullary hyperplasia is a rare disorder that may be a precursor to pheochromocytoma.  These disorders typically present with symptoms of catecholamine excess (eg, palpitations, diaphoresis) and episodic hypertension.  Patients have elevated blood and urine levels of catecholamines rather than cortisol. $#Educational objective# ACTH is the major trophic hormone of the zona fasciculata and reticularis, whereas the zona glomerulosa is primarily regulated by angiotensin II.

  "explanation_2": "This patient has hypertension and likely #type 2 diabetes mellitus#.  The primary defects in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes include #defective insulin secretion# from pancreatic beta cells and #insulin resistance# in peripheral tissues.  Insulin resistance is caused by a number of genetic (eg, insulin receptor and postreceptor mutations) and environmental factors (eg, lack of physical activity, obesity). $An adipose body habitus is commonly associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.  In particular, excess #visceral fat# (surrounding internal organs) correlates much more strongly with insulin resistance than does subcutaneous fat.  Measurement of #waist circumference# or #waist-to-hip ratio# is an effective indirect assessment of visceral fat, especially in patients who are overweight (BMI 25-29.9 kg/m2) or mildly obese (BMI 30-34.9 kg/m2).  A waist circumference >102 cm (40 in) in men and >88 cm (35 in) in women is associated with a higher risk of insulin resistance. $The association of insulin resistance, increased visceral adiposity (ie, increased waist circumference), hypertension, and serum lipid abnormalities (high triglyceride levels, low HDL levels) is known as #metabolic syndrome# (sometimes called syndrome X).  Patients with metabolic syndrome have increased rates of #cardiovascular events# and warrant careful risk factor management. $#(Choice A)#  Insulin suppresses gluconeogenesis and promotes glycogen synthesis in the liver.  In patients with insulin resistance, the inhibitory effect of insulin on gluconeogenesis is reduced, leading to increased hepatic glucose production. $#(Choice B)#  High LDL levels are an independent risk factor for atherosclerotic heart disease in patients with diabetes, but are not directly associated with increased insulin resistance.  In contrast, insulin resistance is associated with high triglyceride and low HDL levels. $#(Choice C)#  High urinary excretion of ketones suggests absolute insulin deficiency, as seen in type 1 diabetes, rather than insulin resistance.  Patients with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance typically have high circulating insulin levels that are more than adequate to suppress ketone formation. $#(Choice D)#  Skeletal muscle is a major repository for ingested glucose due to insulin-mediated glucose uptake.  In patients with insulin resistance, decreased glucose uptake in skeletal muscle leads to reduced glycogen synthesis and higher blood glucose levels. $#Educational objective# Visceral obesity as measured by waist circumference or waist-to-hip ratio is an important predictor of insulin resistance.

Bilateral adrenal hyperplasia is the most common cause, followed by a unilateral adrenal adenoma. $#Aldosterone#, which is normally regulated by angiotensin II and K+ levels, stimulates reabsorption of sodium (Na+) and secretion of potassium (K+) and hydrogen (H+) in the renal collecting ducts.  Excess aldosterone causes Na+ retention, hypertension, and feedback suppression of the renin-angiotensin system (ie, #low renin activity#).  Some patients also develop metabolic alkalosis and #hypokalemia#.  Symptomatic hypokalemia may cause #muscle weakness#, cramps, and, occasionally, rhabdomyolysis and cardiac arrhythmias. $Despite increased Na+ reabsorption, extravascular volume overload (eg, peripheral edema) is rarely seen due to a phenomenon known as @aldosterone escape@.  With aldosterone escape, increased intravascular volume increases pressure natriuresis and augments atrial natriuretic peptide release, thereby limiting net Na+ retention and extravascular volume overload.  Hypernatremia is also not typically seen because the temporary increase in serum osmolality triggers a compensatory rise in antidiuretic hormone release. $#(Choices A and B)#  Pheochromocytomas are catecholamine-secreting tumors arising from the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla or extraadrenal sympathetic chain that typically present with severe hypertension.  Pheochromocytomas stimulate the renin-angiotensin system due to high circulating catecholamine levels and are associated with tachycardia and symptoms of catecholamine excess (eg, sweating, palpitations, headache). $#(Choice C)#  Increased renin production by the juxtaglomerular apparatus leads to hypertension with elevated aldosterone levels.  This typically occurs in the setting of renal artery stenosis due to decreased renal blood flow.  However, this patient's renin activity is suppressed. $#(Choices D and F)#  Hypersecretion from cells of the zona fasciculata or zona reticularis would lead to Cushing syndrome or hyperandrogenism, respectively.  Cushing syndrome can cause hypertension and hypokalemia but is usually associated with weight gain and a cushingoid body habitus (eg, central obesity, moon facies).  Clinical manifestations of adrenal hyperandrogenism are typically minimal in men because androgen levels are already high due to testicular testosterone production. $#Educational objective# Primary hyperaldosteronism is caused by excessive aldosterone secretion, typically due to an aldosterone-producing adrenal adenoma or bilateral nodular hyperplasia of the zona glomerulosa.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient with headaches and blurred vision (suggestive of severe hypertension) underwent resection of an #adrenocortical adenoma# (well-defined, yellowish tumor).  Hyperfunctioning adrenocortical adenomas secrete hormones depending on the location of the cells within the adrenal cortex.  In this patient, the tumor cells arise from the #outermost layer# (zona glomerulosa), which is responsible for producing #aldosterone#. $Hypersecretion of aldosterone by an adrenocortical adenoma is a common cause of primary hyperaldosteronism (@Conn syndrome@).  Aldosterone, which is normally regulated by angiotensin II and potassium (K+) levels, stimulates reabsorption of sodium (Na+) and secretion of K+ and hydrogen (H+) in the renal collecting ducts.  Excess aldosterone therefore causes increased intravascular volume and #hypertension#, in addition to predisposing to metabolic alkalosis and #hypokalemia#.  Hypokalemia can cause muscle cramps, #muscle weakness#, and #paresthesia# due to @hyperpolarization@, which impairs membrane depolarization. $Despite increased Na+ reabsorption, extravascular volume overload (weight gain, peripheral edema) rarely occurs due to @aldosterone escape@.  With aldosterone escape, increased intravascular volume increases pressure natriuresis and augments atrial natriuretic peptide release, thereby limiting net Na+ retention and extravascular fluid accumulation. $#(Choice A)#  Diarrhea and flushing may be seen in carcinoid syndrome, a rare condition most often caused by a serotonin (5-HT)-secreting tumor derived from neuroendocrine cells of the gastrointestinal tract. $#(Choice B)#  Excessive hair growth (hirsutism) can result from excess androgen production.  An adrenal tumor causing androgen hypersecretion would have the functionality of the innermost layer of the adrenal cortex (zona reticularis) rather than the outermost layer as in this patient. $#(Choice D)#  Sweating and tremulousness can be caused by excess circulating catecholamines such as from a pheochromocytoma, which can also cause headaches and blurred vision as in this patient.  However, these tumors arise from the adrenal medulla rather than the adrenal cortex. $#(Choice E)#  Patients with Cushing syndrome often develop weight gain (due to central fat accumulation) and have easy bruising (due to thinning of subcutaneous connective tissue).  Cortisol-secreting adrenal tumors would be functionally similar to the middle layer of the adrenal cortex (zona fasciculata). $#Educational objective# Hypersecreting adrenocortical tumors can have functionality resembling the outer (aldosterone), middle (cortisol), or inner (androgens) layers of the adrenal cortex.  Primary hyperaldosteronism results in hypertension in addition to hypokalemia, which can cause muscle cramps, muscle weakness, and paresthesia.  ",

  "explanation_2": "$Normal pubertal development in girls manifests with @secondary sexual characteristics@ at age ≥8 and is due to pulsatile GnRH secretion from the hypothalamus.  This stimulates LH and FSH release from the pituitary, which triggers ovarian estrogen production.  Precocious puberty, defined in girls as the development of secondary sexual characteristics at age <8, is often caused by early maturation of this hormonal axis, or #idiopathic precocious puberty#.  This condition is gonadotropin-dependent and characterized by early-onset #pulsatile GnRH# secretion, resulting in rising #estrogen production# in young girls. $Major actions of estrogen include stimulation of #breast development# and bone growth.  A @growth spurt@ occurs during early puberty primarily due to positive feedback by estrogen on growth hormone (GH) production.  GH stimulates insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) synthesis, which leads to the differentiation and proliferation of chondrocytes in the epiphyseal plate and therefore increased linear growth #(Choices D and E)#.  This rapid growth explains this patient's height at the 95th percentile, and the growth spurt typically results in achievement of 90% of final adult height. $At high doses, estradiol, a potent estrogen-derived steroid hormone, promotes senescence of chondrocytes and therefore #closure of the epiphyseal plate# (ie, @growth plate@) #(Choices A and B)#.  Once it is closed, linear growth is irreversibly stopped.  Although this patient is now taller than her peers, #without treatment#, excess estrogens will cause the growth plates to close prematurely, and she will be #shorter# than average.  Treatment of central precocious puberty is typically with a GnRH agonist, which causes continuous (rather than pulsatile) stimulation of the gonadotrophs, leading to decreased sex hormone production. $#Educational objective# Idiopathic precocious puberty is characterized by early-onset, pulsatile GnRH secretion, resulting in increased estrogen production.  Estrogens promote bone growth but also epiphyseal plate (ie, growth plate) closure, so without treatment, patients typically have an early growth spurt but a shorter-than-expected adult height.  ",

Patients may experience a transient hyperthyroid phase, but the thyroid gland is characteristically painful and tender to palpation. $#Educational objective# Postpartum thyroiditis occurs within 12 months of pregnancy and is characterized by autoimmune destruction of thyroid follicles.  It typically has a hyperthyroid phase due to release of preformed thyroid hormone, followed by a hypothyroid phase due to depletion of thyroid hormone stores and eventual return to a euthyroid state.  Thyroid metabolic activity during the hyperthyroid phase is suppressed, and glandular blood flow and radioiodine uptake are low.  ",

Breast growth is inhibited by androgens and promoted by estrogens; conditions that cause #increased estrogen/androgen ratio# can lead to gynecomastia. $This patient, who did not respond to first-line therapy (ie, tamsulosin, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist) for benign prostatic hyperplasia, has likely been prescribed a #5-alpha reductase inhibitor# (eg, finasteride, dutasteride).  These medications #block conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone#, which has a higher affinity for the testosterone receptor and mediates most testosterone effects (including prostatic hyperplasia). $However, the #excess testosterone# is then #converted to estrogen# (eg, estradiol) by @aromatase@ in various tissues (eg, adipose, bone), leading to gynecomastia.

  "explanation_2": "$Like most hormones, secretion of cortisol is regulated via a @negative feedback loop@.  Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is secreted by the hypothalamus in response to stress and circadian signals received from other parts of the central nervous system.  CRH stimulates ACTH release by the pituitary, which in turn increases cortisol secretion by the adrenal cortex.  High cortisol levels suppress secretion of ACTH and CRH, and low cortisol levels cause an increase in ACTH and CRH secretion. $Although not commonly used, the #metyrapone stimulation test# is a sensitive indicator of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis integrity.  Metyrapone blocks cortisol synthesis by inhibiting #11-β-hydroxylase#, which converts #11-deoxycortisol to cortisol# in the @zona fasciculata@.  Because 11-deoxycortisol lacks glucocorticoid activity, it does not inhibit pituitary ACTH secretion.  As a result, the reduction in cortisol levels following metyrapone administration cause an increase in pituitary ACTH secretion.  This leads to increased production of 11-deoxycortisol, which is further metabolized by the liver to #17-hydroxycorticosteroids# that accumulate in the urine. $Serum 11-deoxycortisol and urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroid levels will normally rise in response to metyrapone, indicating an intact HPA axis.  Failure of these steroid levels to increase implies primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency, which can be distinguished based on plasma ACTH levels. $#(Choices B and D)#  The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system regulates aldosterone synthesis by the zona glomerulosa.  Because metyrapone inhibits 11-β-hydroxylase, aldosterone synthesis will decrease.  However, accumulation of the aldosterone precursor 11-deoxycorticosterone (a weak mineralocorticoid) prevents the development of mineralocorticoid deficiency, so renin levels will not change significantly. $#(Choice C)#  The inhibition of 11-β-hydroxylase by metyrapone would lead to a decrease in cortisol, not an increase. $#(Choice E)#  Vasopressin is a hormone secreted by the posterior pituitary that is responsible for regulating water balance.  Additionally, vasopressin acts as a potentiator for CRH, enhancing the release of ACTH.  However, there is no clear feedback loop between cortisol and vasopressin; therefore, metyrapone administration is unlikely to lead to vasopressin overproduction. $#Educational objective# Administration of metyrapone will cause a decrease in cortisol synthesis via inhibition of 11-β-hydroxylase.  In patients with an intact hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, this will cause a reactive increase in ACTH, 11-deoxycortisol, and urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroid levels.  ",

Low estrogen levels lead to increased production of inflammatory cytokines (especially IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor–alpha), increasing expression of the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) and resulting in increased osteoclast activity.  Loss of estrogen, whether from menopause, ovulatory dysfunction, or surgical removal of the ovaries, increases the risk of bone loss and #osteoporosis#. $#(Choice A)#  Adenomas are associated with pituitary apoplexy (hemorrhage into the pituitary).  However, this occurs more commonly with large adenomas and is not typically associated with strokes located in the cortex. $#(Choice B)#  Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 1 is characterized by pituitary adenomas, hyperparathyroidism, and endocrine tumors of the pancreas.  Gastrin-secreting pancreatic tumors are common and may lead to recurrent peptic ulcers (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome).  However, almost all patients with MEN type 1 have hyperparathyroidism with hypercalcemia. $#(Choice D)#  Early menopause (age <40) is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, but the effect of the prolactinoma-induced low estrogenic state on cardiovascular risk in older women is unclear. $#(Choice E)#  Excess growth hormone secretion from a somatotroph pituitary adenoma can lead to diabetes mellitus due to increased insulin resistance in peripheral tissues.  However, adults typically present with @acromegaly@. $#Educational objective# Hyperprolactinemia suppresses secretion of GnRH, which leads to reduced estrogen in women.

Hirsutism can be due to increased androgen production (eg, polycystic ovary syndrome, Cushing syndrome, ovarian and adrenal tumors), increased local conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), or higher sensitivity of hair follicles to DHT (eg, idiopathic hirsutism).  With excessive androgen exposure, soft, non-pigmented villous hair changes to coarse pigmented terminal hair in androgen-dependent areas of the body (eg, face, chest, back).  #Virilization #occurs with very high androgen levels and is characterized by clitoromegaly, increased muscularity, and voice deepening in addition to hirsutism. $The most common cause of hirsutism is #polycystic ovary syndrome #(PCOS), which is often associated with elevated androgen levels.  Combination oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) are usually the first choice for treating hirsutism in PCOS.

LH, FSH, and testosterone levels are all low, and spermatogenesis is impaired.  Unlike in this patient, testes in central hypogonadism are atrophic and soft (not hyalinized and firm), and gynecomastia is uncommon because the decrease in gonadotropins reduces aromatase activity. $#(Choice B)#  Azoospermia associated with a normal hormonal profile suggests an obstruction along the path from the testes to the seminal fluid (eg, congenital absence of the vas deferens in cystic fibrosis).  In these patients, the testes and breasts are grossly normal. $#(Choice C)#  Decreased LH, normal FSH, and elevated testosterone in the setting of a low sperm count suggest exogenous testosterone use.  High androgen levels suppress LH secretion, decreasing endogenous testosterone production.  Despite the high circulating levels of exogenous androgen, these patients have a low sperm count because local androgen concentrations in the seminiferous tubule are suboptimal for spermatogenesis.  Over time, this leads to atrophy of the seminiferous tubules and soft, small testes. $#(Choice E)#  Normal LH and testosterone, elevated FSH, and a low sperm count can be seen in patients with cryptorchidism.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient's symptoms (eg, fatigue, weight gain, constipation) and examination findings suggest #hypothyroidism#.  Vital signs typically show bradycardia and hypertension (due to increased vascular resistance).  Hypothyroidism can also cause slowed hair growth and alterations in hair growth cycles, leading to thinning of the scalp hair and lateral eyebrows.  Slowed reuptake of calcium by the sarcoplasmic reticulum manifests as a delayed relaxation phase of deep tendon reflexes. $Most patients with hypothyroidism have #primary hypothyroidism# (ie, dysfunction within the thyroid gland).  The thyroid releases thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine [T3] and thyroxine [T4]) in response to TSH from the pituitary.  In turn, TSH secretion is regulated by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamus.  Thyroid hormone suppresses TSH and TRH via negative feedback, and #small changes in thyroid hormone# levels lead to #large changes in TSH# levels.  As thyroid hormone production slows, TSH secretion increases rapidly to restore thyroid activity, often before T4 levels fall below standard laboratory reference ranges.  Therefore, #serum TSH# is the #most sensitive# marker for primary hypothyroidism. $#(Choices A and B)#  The 24-hour urinary cortisol assay and the dexamethasone suppression test are used to screen for Cushing syndrome.  Although this patient is hypertensive, she does not have other Cushingoid features (eg, central obesity, skin striae, proximal muscle weakness). $#(Choice C)#  Initial tests for diabetes mellitus include fasting glucose, hemoglobin A1c, and oral glucose tolerance tests.  Diabetes can cause peripheral neuropathy (eg, paresthesias, loss of distal sensation, decreased ankle reflexes), but bradycardia, diastolic hypertension, and delayed relaxation of reflexes are more suggestive of hypothyroidism. $#(Choice D)#  The initial evaluation of hereditary hemochromatosis includes serum iron studies (eg, serum iron, ferritin, transferrin saturation).  Although pituitary dysfunction with secondary (central) hypothyroidism can occur, patients commonly also have arthritis, diabetes mellitus, abnormal skin pigmentation, and hepatomegaly. $#(Choice E)#  TSH is more sensitive than either T3 or T4 for diagnosing primary hypothyroidism.  TSH is not elevated in pituitary or hypothalamic disease (ie, secondary hypothyroidism), but this is a much less common cause of hypothyroidism (<5% of cases).  In addition, patients with secondary hypothyroidism usually have other clinical features of hypothalamic or pituitary dysfunction. $#Educational objective# The thyroid releases thyroid hormone (triiodothyronine [T3] and thyroxine [T4]) in response to TSH from the pituitary, which is regulated by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamus.  Thyroid hormone suppresses the secretion of TSH and TRH via negative feedback, and small changes in thyroid hormone levels cause large changes in TSH.  Serum TSH is the most sensitive test for primary hypothyroidism.  "

  "explanation_2": "$Glucose levels fall in all newborns after birth, but usually remain ≥40 mg/dL due to mobilization of hepatic glycogen stores and initiation of feeding; glucose <40 mg/dL is indicative of #neonatal hypoglycemia#, a common metabolic derangement seen in #infants of diabetic mothers#. $During gestation, glucose is transferred continuously from mother to fetus via the placenta.  Mothers with diabetes, particularly those with poor glycemic control, often have hyperglycemia, causing #fetal hyperglycemia#.

DKA is often precipitated by infections, including urinary tract infections (likely in this patient).  Patients with DKA lose significant amounts of potassium in the urine, primarily via glycosuria-induced osmotic diuresis and hypovolemia-mediated increase in aldosterone secretion.  This results in a #total body potassium deficit# that is reflected by decreased intracellular potassium stores (since 98% of the body's potassium is stored intracellularly).

In addition, PTH upregulates the expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANK-L) on the surface of the activated osteoblasts, which binds RANK on nearby osteoclast precursor cells and induces maturation to active osteoclasts.  Therefore, #PTH #causes #bone formation# (by direct effect on osteoblasts) and #bone resorption# (by paracrine effect on osteoclasts).  @Bone turnover@ is normally #balanced#, with bone formation proportionate to resorption. $In #hyperparathyroid states#, continuous exposure to high PTH levels cause increased RANK-L expression along with suppression of osteoprotegerin (a counterregulatory decoy receptor).  This leads to greater bone resorption than formation and #net bone loss#. $#(Choices A and D)#  PTH upregulates 1-alpha-hydroxylase in the kidneys, which leads to increased (not decreased) conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (calcidiol) to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol).  Calcitriol subsequently induces increased (not decreased) intestinal calcium absorption. $#(Choice B)#  PTH increases renal reabsorption of calcium.  Despite this, hypercalciuria is common in hyperparathyroidism because the filtered calcium load may exceed renal reabsorption capacity.  However, the local concentrations of calcium in the bone remain elevated, and urinary calcium wasting is not a major contributor to bone loss. $#(Choice C)#  Supraphysiologic glucocorticoid (eg, prednisone) doses can cause osteoporosis, in part due to decreased proliferation and differentiation of osteoblast precursor cells.  PTH increases the differentiation of osteoblast precursors; osteoporosis occurs in hyperparathyroidism because of a proportionally greater increase in osteoclast activity. $#Educational objective# Parathyroid hormone directly stimulates osteoblasts, leading to increased bone formation.  Expression of RANK-L on osteoblasts induces increased bone resorption via a paracrine effect on nearby osteoclasts.

These findings, along with suppressed plasma renin, suggest #primary hyperaldosteronism# (ie, mineralocorticoid excess).  Primary hyperaldosteronism is most commonly caused by a unilateral #adrenal adenoma# (Conn syndrome) or bilateral adrenal hyperplasia (idiopathic hyperaldosteronism). $Hyperaldosteronism is characterized by increased distal @Na+ reabsorption@ in the renal collecting ducts.  This creates a negative charge in the lumen, pulling H+ and K+ from tubular cells and leading to their urinary excretion.  As a result, #hypokalemia# is common.  Increased H+ excretion by alpha-intercalated cells promotes bicarbonate production and increased activity of the basolateral HCO3−/Cl− exchanger, resulting in elevated serum bicarbonate and #metabolic alkalosis (choice E).# $Despite increased Na+ reabsorption, overt volume overload (eg, pedal edema) is rarely seen due to a phenomenon known as #aldosterone escape#.  Increased intravascular volume increases pressure natriuresis and augments atrial natriuretic peptide release, thereby limiting net sodium retention and overt volume overload.  Hypernatremia is also not typically seen because the temporary increase in serum osmolality triggers a compensatory rise in antidiuretic hormone (ADH) release. $#(Choice A)#  Loop or thiazide diuretic use can cause metabolic alkalosis, hypokalemia, and hyponatremia (mostly with thiazides) due to urinary losses of H+, K+, and Na+.  Na+ loss leads to hypovolemia, which can exacerbate hyponatremia (due to nonosmotic stimulus for ADH secretion) and alkalosis (due to increased bicarbonate reabsorption). $#(Choice C)#  Primary adrenal insufficiency reduces urinary excretion of H+ and K+ and promotes renal Na+ loss due to low aldosterone.  As a result, metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, and hypovolemia develop. $#(Choice D)#  Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (eg, spironolactone) block aldosterone receptors, thereby impairing urinary excretion of H+ and K+.  Common adverse effects therefore include metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia.  Na+ excretion is only mildly increased, and serum Na+ concentration is usually not significantly affected. $#Educational objective# Primary hyperaldosteronism increases distal Na+ reabsorption (secondary hypertension), leading to increased urinary excretion of H+ and K+ (metabolic alkalosis and hypokalemia).  Overt volume overload is not seen due to aldosterone escape, and serum Na+ concentration is typically normal due to preserved antidiuretic hormone function.  ",

However, her thyroid is small and serum #thyroglobulin is undetectable#, which suggests an #exogenous source# of thyroid hormone.  Thyroglobulin is a glycoprotein produced by thyroid follicular cells that makes up a substantial component of follicular colloid and serves as the substrate for the formation of thyroid hormone.  A small amount is released by the thyroid in normal function.  Low levels, as in this patient, suggest noninflammatory #suppression of thyroid activity#. $In light of her mother's hypothyroidism, which suggests a possible source of levothyroxine tablets, this patient is likely surreptitiously taking thyroid hormone in an attempt to lose weight.  Exogenous thyrotoxicosis can also occur in patients taking over-the-counter supplements containing animal thyroid tissue and in erroneous dosing of thyroid replacement therapy.  Excess T4 supplementation suppresses TSH, which decreases iodine organification and colloid formation resulting in #atrophy of thyroid follicles#. $#(Choice B)#  Histopathology in @chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto) thyroiditis@ is characterized by a mononuclear infiltrate consisting of lymphocytes and plasma cells, often with germinal centers.  Hashimoto thyroiditis typically presents with primary hypothyroidism (elevated TSH, low free T4) and goiter; although Hashimoto's can occasionally present with an initial hyperthyroid phase, these patients will have elevated thyroglobulin levels due to inflammatory disruption of thyroid follicles. $#(Choice C)#  Subacute @granulomatous (de Quervain) thyroiditis@ is characterized by disruption of follicles and a mixed cellular infiltrate with occasional multinucleated giant cells.  Patients may have hyperthyroidism but typically have a painful, tender thyroid gland and high levels of thyroglobulin due to destructive thyroiditis. $#(Choice D)#  @Medullary thyroid cancer@ is a neuroendocrine tumor that arises from calcitonin-secreting parafollicular C cells.  Microscopy shows nests or sheets of polygonal or spindle-shaped cells with extracellular amyloid deposits (derived from calcitonin).  Clinical features include diarrhea, flushing, and thyroid nodules, but TSH and free T4 are normal. $#(Choice E)#  @Graves disease@ presents with a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland associated with hyperthyroidism, exophthalmos, and pretibial myxedema.  The thyroid follicular epithelium is tall and crowded with hyperactive reabsorption, causing scalloping around the edges of the colloid.  However, high serum levels of thyroglobulin would be seen due to increased thyroid metabolic activity. $#Educational objective# Exogenous hyperthyroidism is characterized by elevated free thyroxine (T4), suppressed TSH, and low/undetectable thyroglobulin.  It can occur with surreptitious levothyroxine misuse, animal-sourced thyroid supplements, and erroneous dosing of thyroid replacement therapy.  Over time, the lack of TSH stimulation causes the thyroid follicles to become atrophic.  ",

  "explanation_2": "This patient is genetically male (46,XY) with features suggestive of @17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency@, a rare cause of #congenital adrenal hyperplasia# (CAH).  The enzyme 17 alpha-hydroxylase is active in the adrenal glands and gonads and is responsible for converting pregnenolone to 17-hydroxypregnenolone and progesterone to 17-hydroxyprogesterone.  Deficiency of this enzyme #impairs synthesis of sex hormones# (eg, testosterone, estradiol) and cortisol but #does not inhibit mineralocorticoid production#. $Due to the absence of androgens in utero, genetic males (46,XY) with 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency have undervirilized, ambiguous genitalia.  In severe cases, they appear #phenotypically female# but lack internal female genitalia, as in this case.  In contrast, genetic females (46,XX) develop normal internal and external genitalia.  At puberty, impaired synthesis of sex hormones in the gonads leads to #absent secondary sexual characteristics# in both sexes and primary amenorrhea in girls. $Excess mineralocorticoid production results in #hypertension# and #hypokalemia# that are usually detected around the expected time of #puberty#.  Low cortisol provides positive feedback to increase ACTH production, further stimulating the mineralocorticoid pathway.  This allows for the excess production of weak glucocorticoids (ie, corticosterone), preventing the detrimental effects of low cortisol. $#(Choice A)#  @5 alpha-reductase deficiency@ prevents conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, the hormone responsible for male external genitalia development.  Affected genetic males have ambiguous genitalia at birth but develop normal secondary sexual characteristics (eg, increased muscle mass, phallus enlargement) at puberty because these features are testosterone dependent.  Blood pressure and electrolytes are unaffected. $#(Choice B)#  @11 beta-hydroxylase deficiency@ causes decreased glucocorticoid synthesis and increased production of adrenal androgens.  Because the production of 11-deoxycorticosterone (weak mineralocorticoid) is also increased, individuals with this deficiency have features of mineralocorticoid excess (eg, hypertension, hypokalemia).  However, genetic males appear phenotypically normal. $#(Choice D)#  20,22-desmolase (side chain cleavage enzyme) deficiency results in impaired synthesis of all steroid hormones with accumulation of cholesterol esters in the adrenal glands and gonads.  Complete deficiency is lethal, and partial deficiency typically presents in infancy with signs of adrenal insufficiency (eg, hypotension, hyperkalemia). $#(Choice E)#  The most common form of CAH is @21-hydroxylase deficiency@.  It causes decreased glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid synthesis and increased adrenal androgen production.  In contrast to this patient, genetic males with 21-hydroxylase deficiency appear phenotypically normal. $#Educational objective# Deficiency of 17 alpha-hydroxylase is a rare form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia characterized by impaired synthesis of androgens, estrogens, and cortisol with excess production of mineralocorticoids.  Genetic males with this deficiency may have phenotypically female external genitalia and present with hypertension and hypokalemia around the expected time of puberty.  ",

Glucagon-induced glycogenolysis is the predominant initial means of rapidly increasing blood glucose levels during hypoglycemia. $Glucagon functions by stimulating G protein–coupled receptors on hepatocytes, increasing intracellular cAMP concentration and activating protein kinase A.  This leads to activation of the key glycogenolytic enzyme, glycogen phosphorylase.  It also stimulates gluconeogenesis by activating rate-limiting gluconeogenetic enzymes (eg, pyruvate carboxylase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase) and decreasing intracellular fructose-2,6-bisphosphate levels (inhibiting glycolysis). $#(Choices A, B, and F)#  Epinephrine from the adrenals increases glucose by multiple mechanisms, including increased glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in the liver and decreased glucose uptake by skeletal muscle.  Epinephrine also causes increased alanine release from skeletal muscle, which serves as a source of gluconeogenesis in the liver.  In adipose tissue, epinephrine increases the breakdown of triglycerides, thereby increasing circulating free fatty acids and glycerol that can be utilized as gluconeogenetic substrates. $#(Choice C)#  During the first 12 hours of fasting, hepatic glycogenolysis is the source for most of the body's glucose.  When hypoglycemia is sustained, gluconeogenesis in the renal cortex becomes an important glucose source.  Epinephrine is more effective than glucagon in stimulating renal gluconeogenesis. $#(Choice E)#  Glucagon and insulin are pancreatic hormones that act as key blood glucose regulators.  Insulin decreases blood glucose levels and suppresses glucagon secretion.  Although it sounds counterintuitive, glucagon stimulates insulin secretion by acting on the pancreatic beta cells (allowing glucose to be taken up by insulin-sensitive tissues). $#(Choice G)#  The treatment of choice in hypoglycemic patients without an altered sensorium is to administer glucose orally as glucose is a monosaccharide that gets absorbed rapidly from the gastrointestinal tract. $#Educational objective# Glucagon increases serum glucose by increasing hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis.  Glucagon also stimulates insulin secretion from the pancreas.  Unlike epinephrine, glucagon has an insignificant effect on glucose homeostasis in the skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and renal cortex.  "

Other possible findings include hyperglycemia, dermal atrophy, and easy bruisability.  Hypercortisolism can be confirmed on finding an elevated late-night salivary cortisol concentration or #increased 24-hour urine cortisol# excretion. $Cushing syndrome can be categorized as ACTH-dependent (ie, #↑ACTH# stimulating excess cortisol production) or ACTH-independent (ie, glucocorticoid excess not caused by ACTH).  Excess ACTH secretion causes identifiable clinical findings: $• #Hyperpigmentation:#  Both ACTH and alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) are derived from pro-opiomelanocortin, leading to cosecretion of alpha-MSH.  ACTH also directly stimulates the MC2R receptor on melanocytes. $• Androgenization:  ACTH stimulates production of adrenal androgens (eg, #↑DHEAS# [dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate], androstenedione).  This leads to #hirsutism#, #menstrual abnormalities#, and oily skin. $This patient's hyperpigmentation and hirsutism are consistent with ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism, likely due to a corticotroph pituitary adenoma (#Cushing disease#). $#(Choice B)#  Primary adrenal insufficiency leads to decreased cortisol levels (and decreased urinary cortisol excretion) with a compensatory rise in ACTH.  Hyperpigmentation may be present, but adrenal androgen production is often diminished (due to loss of androgen-producing adrenocortical cells) and hirsutism is not present. $#(Choices C and E)#  ACTH-independent Cushing syndrome due to a cortisol-producing adrenal adenoma is characterized by increased urinary cortisol excretion with suppressed ACTH levels.  Exogenous glucocorticoids also cause suppression of ACTH, but with decreased production (and urinary excretion) of cortisol.  Low cortisol excretion and ACTH levels are also seen in central adrenal insufficiency.  Because ACTH is low in these states, patients do not have hyperpigmentation or hyperandrogenic features (eg, hirsutism). $#(Choice D)#  Polycystic ovary syndrome is characterized by excessive ovarian production of androgens.  Common clinical features include oligo/amenorrhea, obesity, and hirsutism.  However, ACTH and cortisol production are unaffected, and hyperpigmentation is not seen. $#Educational objective# Cushing syndrome can be categorized as ACTH-dependent or ACTH-independent.

However, polyuria is typically only transient (lasting <6 weeks) because the hypothalamus is able to bypass the pituitary and directly release ADH into the circulation. $#(Choice E)#  Hyperpigmentation in the context of pituitary disease is typically due to hypersecretion of ACTH, either due to a corticotroph adenoma or in response to primary adrenal insufficiency. $#Educational objective# Pituitary tumors can present with headaches, bitemporal hemianopsia, and hypopituitarism; the most common hormonally active (functional) adenomas are prolactin-secreting adenomas (prolactinomas).

  "explanation_2": "$This patient with #sarcoidosis #has a hypothalamic and pituitary stalk mass with #mass-effect symptoms# (eg, headache, bitemporal visual field defects).  In combination with the recurrent hypercalcemia (caused by excessive calcitriol formation by activated macrophages) 6 months after the discontinuation of glucocorticoid therapy, this presentation suggests active sarcoidosis with involvement of the hypothalamus (#neurosarcoidosis#).  Although sarcoidosis classically causes noncaseating granulomas involving the lungs, lymph nodes, and skin, granulomas can form in any tissue. $Mass lesions in the hypothalamus or pituitary stalk can disrupt the hypothalamic-pituitary axis by obstructing the hypophyseal portal system.  Unlike other pituitary hormones, #prolactin# release is #negatively regulated by dopamine# produced in the hypothalamus.  Dopamine acts on the dopamine D2 receptors of lactotrophs, the prolactin-producing cells of the pituitary.  Disruption of dopaminergic pathways (eg, by an infiltrating sarcoid lesion) in the pituitary stalk leads to #loss of inhibition# and a subsequent #increase in prolactin#. $#(Choices A, B, and D)#  Pituitary adenomas can cause excess hormone formation; however, this patient has a hypothalamic mass, not a pituitary adenoma.  In contrast to prolactin, other pituitary hormones (ACTH, growth hormone, thyrotropin [TSH], LH, and FSH) are inhibited by hypothalamic lesions because the dominant effect of the hypothalamus on them is stimulatory.  Although abruptly discontinuing an oral glucocorticoid can cause adrenal insufficiency with a subsequent increase in ACTH, low blood pressure, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia would be expected.  In addition, adrenal insufficiency typically occurs rapidly after glucocorticoid withdrawal (not 6 months later). $#(Choice E)#  Vasopressin is produced in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus and transported to the posterior pituitary for release.  Lesions of the hypothalamus and pituitary stalk can decrease vasopressin levels.  Mass lesions in the central nervous system can cause vasopressin secretory dysregulation, leading to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) with euvolemic hyponatremia.  However, the normal sodium levels in this patient exclude this syndrome. $#Educational objective# The release of prolactin is under inhibitory control by dopamine secretion from the hypothalamus.  Disruption of dopaminergic pathways or blockade of dopamine D2 receptors can cause hyperprolactinemia.  "

Characteristic features include unilateral or bilateral breast enlargement that is directly under the nipple-areolar complex, is often #tender#, and measures <4 cm. $The mechanism of physiologic gynecomastia is likely multifactorial: $• #Imbalance of estradiol and testosterone:#  During early male puberty, adrenal androgens increase (ie, adrenarche) and are converted by aromatase to estrogens, which stimulate growth of glandular breast tissue.  Testosterone, which is produced by the testes and inhibits the development of breast tissue, typically remains low until full maturation of the @hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis@.

For example, low testosterone levels suggest hypogonadism and may warrant karyotyping to evaluate for @Klinefelter syndrome@ (47,XXY) and/or serum prolactin to assess for a prolactin-secreting tumor.  This patient's stage 4 pubic hair and otherwise normal examination make physiologic gynecomastia much more likely. $#(Choice B)#  Mammography may be indicated for findings concerning for breast cancer, such as a fixed, nontender mass outside of the nipple-areolar complex with associated skin dimpling, nipple discharge, or adenopathy.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient's combination of hyponatremia and a lung mass is suggestive of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (#SIADH#).  Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is normally produced in the hypothalamus and secreted from the @posterior pituitary@  in response to changes in plasma osmolality and intravascular volume.  However, #small cell lung carcinomas#, which are tumors of neuroendocrine origin, often release ADH independent of feedback inhibition (paraneoplastic effect).  This @inappropriate secretion@ of ADH leads to hyponatremia, decreased plasma osmolality, and elevated urine osmolality (which normally should be <100 mOsm/kg when hyponatremia is present).  The profound hyponatremia that occurs in SIADH can cause headache, weakness, #altered mental status#, and seizures. $In SIADH, increased ADH causes excessive water absorption by the kidneys, leading to a transient, subclinical hypervolemia.  This mild increase in extracellular fluid volume suppresses the renin-aldosterone axis and stimulates the production of natriuretic peptides, leading to excretion of sodium in the urine (natriuresis).  As a result, patients with SIADH have a #clinically normal extracellular fluid volume# and low plasma osmolality (#euvolemic hyponatremia#).  Features of volume overload (eg, peripheral edema, pulmonary crackles, elevated jugular venous pressure) are not seen #(choices A, B, and E)#. $#(Choice C)#  Patients with SIADH have inappropriately concentrated urine (generally >100 mOsm/kg) for their degree of hyponatremia.  Hyponatremia with a urine osmolality of <100 mOsm/kg (maximally dilute urine) indicates appropriate suppression of ADH secretion (as would be seen in primary polydipsia). $#Educational objective# The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is characterized by low plasma sodium and osmolality, inappropriately concentrated urine, and clinically normal volume status (euvolemic hyponatremia).  An important cause of SIADH is a paraneoplastic effect secondary to small cell carcinoma of the lung.  ",

  "explanation_2": "$This patient's #increased# levels of #thyroxine (T4)#, #triiodothyronine (T3)#, and #TSH# are concerning for #thyroid hormone resistance#.  Most cases are due to an inherited mutation affecting #thyroid hormone receptor beta#, which results in #decreased thyroid hormone sensitivity# in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and peripheral tissues.  Increased levels of T3 and T4 normally provide @negative feedback@ to the pituitary to decrease TSH production.  However, because pituitary cells are also resistant to thyroid hormone in this condition, TSH rises, driving further production of T3 and T4. $The presentation of thyroid hormone resistance varies greatly due to fluctuating thyroid hormone sensitivity in different target tissues; patients may be asymptomatic (ie, euthyroid) or develop hypothyroid or hyperthyroid symptoms (eg, low weight, as in this patient).  The most common finding is #goiter# due to overstimulation of the thyroid gland by TSH.  #Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder# (ADHD) and #tachycardia #are also common due to the preponderance of alpha thyroid hormone receptors (with normal sensitivity) in the CNS and heart. $#(Choice A)#  Chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto) thyroiditis leads to autoantibody-mediated thyroid gland destruction characterized by goiter and symptoms of hypothyroidism (eg, fatigue, constipation, dry skin).  Low T3 and T4 production results in increased TSH. $#(Choice B)#  Thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) binds thyroid hormones and maintains a constant pool of free T3 and T4.  @Increases in TBG@ (eg, pregnancy) result in a clinically euthyroid, asymptomatic state characterized by an increased total T3 and T4 but normal levels of free hormones and TSH. $#(Choice C)#  TSH receptor–stimulating antibodies in Graves disease cause increased T3 and T4 production with signs of hyperthyroidism, including goiter.  In contrast to this patient, those with this condition have appropriate negative feedback to the pituitary, leading to low TSH levels. $#(Choice D)#  Defective thyroid hormone synthesis leads to overt hypothyroidism starting in infancy; symptoms include lethargy, hypotonia, and constipation.  Laboratory evaluation shows low T3 and T4 and elevated TSH. $#Educational objective# Thyroid hormone resistance is characterized by decreased sensitivity of peripheral tissues to thyroid hormones due to a defect in the thyroid hormone receptor.  Levels of thyroxine, triiodothyronine, and TSH are increased.  Patients classically have goiter and frequently develop attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.  ",

In untreated type 1 diabetes, the lack of insulin induces a catabolic state, resulting in increased lipolysis; patients typically lose weight despite a normal or increased appetite. $#(Choice C)#  In skeletal muscle, insulin increases glucose uptake and synthesis of glycogen, which is then available for energy production during exercise.  Insulin also increases amino acid transport and ribosomal translation efficiency in muscle tissue, leading to an overall increase in protein synthesis.  Insulin deficiency in type 1 diabetes leads to decreased muscle glycogen synthesis and muscle wasting. $#(Choice E)#  In the renal tubules, glucose is actively taken up from the tubular lumen by sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) and then passed across the basolateral membrane.

Following oxidation, in a process referred to as organification, iodine reacts with tyrosine residues in thyroglobulin to form monoiodotyrosine (MIT) and diiodotyrosine (DIT) (iodination).  While still attached to thyroglobulin, DIT and MIT participate in 2 coupling reactions:  The coupling of 2 DITs results in formation of #thyroxine# (T4); the combination of 1 DIT and 1 MIT leads to the formation of #triiodothyronine# (T3).  Subsequently, thyroglobulin, which is now attached to multiple iodinated tyrosine compounds (ie, MIT, DIT, T3, T4), is engulfed by the thyroid follicular cells and digested within lysosomes, releasing T3 and T4 into the circulation.

The fall in circulating T3 levels in ESS is primarily due to suppression of peripheral conversion. $#(Choice D)#  Iodine deficiency is rare in developed countries.  When it occurs, it presents chronically with goiter and primary hypothyroidism (ie, elevated TSH, low T4).  This patient has a normal TSH level, making iodine deficiency unlikely. $#(Choice E)#  Proinflammatory cytokines decrease TSH levels by reducing secretion of TRH in the hypothalamus.  In patients with ESS, TSH increases normally following administration of exogenous TRH, suggesting an intact pituitary response to TRH. $#Educational objective# Euthyroid sick syndrome (ESS) is a common pattern of thyroid function markers seen in severely ill patients.  It is characterized by decreased conversion of T4 to T3 in peripheral tissues.  Initial findings include a low T3 level, but later, T4 and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels may also decrease.  ESS may represent a mild central hypothyroid state, which functions to minimize catabolism in severe illness.  ",

  "explanation_2": "$Normal functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis involves pulsatile secretion of GnRH from the hypothalamus, which stimulates the release of FSH and LH from the gonadotrophs of the anterior pituitary.  LH triggers the release of testosterone from the Leydig cells of the testes; FSH stimulates the release of inhibin B from the Sertoli cells of the testes.  Testosterone has a negative feedback effect on LH and GnRH secretion, while #inhibin B suppresses FSH secretion#. $#Sertoli cells# within the seminiferous tubules are #temperature sensitive# and prone to atrophy from heat damage when located outside of the scrotum, which is at a relatively lower temperature than the body's core.  Therefore, when there is an #undescended testicle# (as in this patient with only 1 scrotal testicle) Sertoli cell mass is reduced and circulating levels of #inhibin B# are #low#.  In turn, the lack of negative feedback from inhibin B on FSH production results in #elevated FSH# levels. $#(Choice A)#  Although dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a precursor to testosterone, the testicles only release a small amount of DHEA into the circulation.  Systemic levels of DHEA are derived primarily from the adrenal glands. $#(Choices B, C, and E)#  In contrast to heat-sensitive Sertoli cells, Leydig cell function is not significantly affected by increased temperature, so testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and LH levels are usually normal in cryptorchidism.  In addition, this patient's normal LH level is indicative of normal (not decreased) GnRH activity. $#Educational objective# Inhibin B, which is produced by heat-sensitive Sertoli cells, is a physiologic inhibitor of FSH secretion.  In patients with cryptorchidism, atrophy of Sertoli cells results in decreased inhibin B and, in turn, elevated FSH.  In contrast, Leydig cell function is not significantly affected, so testosterone and LH levels are typically normal in these patients.  "

PAI most commonly results from autoimmune destruction of the bilateral @adrenal cortex@ and often occurs in patients with a preexisting history of #autoimmune disease# (eg, hypothyroidism, type 1 diabetes mellitus).  Reduced mineralocorticoid (mainly aldosterone) production leads to renal salt wasting with consequent #hypovolemia and orthostasis# (systolic blood pressure decrease ≥20 mm Hg with standing).

Although the tubular salt wasting reduces total body sodium, it does not directly affect serum sodium concentration.  However, because hypovolemia provides nonosmotic stimulus for  antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion and ADH secretion is normally inhibited  by cortisol, ADH levels are increased in PAI.

SIADH has no significant effect on serum and urine potassium levels. $#(Choices C and D)#  In hypovolemic states (eg, severe vomiting, diabetic ketoacidosis), restoration of blood volume is the highest priority.  Therefore, the kidneys respond by stimulating increased aldosterone secretion, which decreases urine sodium and increases urine potassium.  The hypovolemia also provides nonosmotic stimulus for ADH release, which leads to hyponatremia.  Both total body and serum potassium are low in severe vomiting due to both gastrointestinal and renal losses.  Although total body potassium is low in diabetic ketoacidosis, serum potassium is high because potassium is unable to enter cells in the absence of insulin. $#(Choice E)#  Primary hyperaldosteronism causes potassium wasting by the renal principal cells, leading to high urine potassium and low serum potassium (hypokalemia).  There is renal sodium retention that leads to increased blood volume, but any significant change in serum or urine sodium concentration is avoided due to @aldosterone escape@. $#Educational objective# Reduced aldosterone production in primary adrenal insufficiency leads to renal sodium wasting with consequent hypovolemia, orthostasis, and potassium retention (hyperkalemia).

  "explanation_2": "$Circulating thyroid hormone exists in 3 primary forms:  $1. #T4 (thyroxine)# is the major secretory product of the thyroid gland.  $2. #T3 (triiodothyronine)# is the most active form of thyroid hormone; a small amount is released by the thyroid gland, but the majority arises from peripheral deiodination of T4.  $3. #Reverse T3 (rT3)# is an inactive form that is generated almost entirely from the peripheral conversion of T4. $The hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis is regulated via #negative feedback# by thyroid hormone on thyrotropin-releasing hormone–secreting neurons in the hypothalamus and thyrotrophs of the anterior pituitary.  In the normal state, most of the circulating thyroid hormone is in the form of T4, which provides most of the feedback suppression of TSH release.  However, T3 also suppresses TSH. $This patient has primary hypothyroidism, with low thyroid hormone (T3 and T4) and elevated TSH levels.  Exogenous T3 supplementation #rapidly suppresses TSH# levels by increasing negative feedback, which in turn decreases T4 secretion from the thyroid gland.  Furthermore, rT3 also decreases because less T4 is available for conversion (T3 cannot be converted into rT3). $However, synthetic T3 (liothyronine) is not recommended for the routine treatment of hypothyroidism, as it has a short half-life and patients can experience wide fluctuations in plasma T3 levels.  T4 (levothyroxine) supplementation provides a more physiologic effect and is preferred. $#Educational objective# TSH from the anterior pituitary stimulates the thyroid to produce thyroxine (T4) and a small amount of triiodothyronine (T3).  T4 is converted in peripheral tissues to T3 (active form) and reverse T3 (inactive form).  TSH secretion is under negative feedback by thyroid hormone on the hypothalamus and pituitary.  "

However, excessive vitamin D can cause symptomatic #hypercalcemia#, with impaired depolarization of neuromuscular membranes (eg, muscle #weakness#, #constipation#, #confusion#) and impaired concentration of urine in the distal tubule (#polyuria/polydipsia#).  Chronic vitamin D intoxication can also lead to #renal stone formation# and bone demineralization with associated #bone pain# (although normal vitamin D levels facilitate bone mineralization, toxicity increases osteoclast activity and bone turnover). $Normally, 25-hydroxyvitamin D is converted to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (the active form) by #1-α-hydroxylase# in the kidneys, a process regulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH).  However, patients with #granulomatous diseases# (eg, sarcoidosis, tuberculosis) can have #PTH-independent conversion# due to expression of 1-α-hydroxylase in #activated macrophages#.

Patients classically develop liver cirrhosis, heart failure, skin hyperpigmentation, and diabetes mellitus (\"bronze diabetes\"). $#(Choice D)#  Pheochromocytoma is associated with elevated levels of metanephrines and catecholamines.  Patients typically have paroxysmal headache, diaphoresis, tachycardia, and hypertension. $#(Choice F)#  Wilson disease (hepatolenticular degeneration) is characterized by impaired incorporation of copper into ceruloplasmin and defective excretion of excess copper into bile.  This leads to elevated blood free copper levels and deposition in the liver (cirrhosis) and brain (motor abnormalities, psychiatric symptoms). $#Educational objective# Excessive vitamin D intake can lead to hypercalcemia and cause mental status changes, muscle weakness, constipation, and polyuria/polydipsia.

LH stimulates the release of testosterone from the Leydig cells in the interstitium of the testicles, and FSH stimulates the release of inhibin B from the Sertoli cells in the seminiferous tubules of the testicles.  Testosterone and inhibin B induce negative feedback on LH and FSH production, respectively. $FSH also stimulates the Sertoli cells to produce androgen-binding protein locally, within the seminiferous tubules.  This androgen-binding protein is responsible for the high local testosterone concentration and is different from sex hormone-binding globulin, which is found in the blood.  High local levels of testosterone and FSH are necessary for spermatogenesis.  Defective FSH receptors will prevent spermatogenesis and cause low inhibin B levels, because FSH is responsible for both spermatogenesis and inhibin B production. $#(Choice A)#  FSH levels will be high in patients with FSH receptor defects because there is no negative feedback from inhibin B; inhibin B cannot be produced without proper functioning of the FSH pathway. $#(Choices B and D)#  LH and testosterone levels are likely to be normal in this patient because FSH does not play a role in either LH or testosterone feedback.  Since the FSH receptor defect is isolated, this patient will have normal testosterone and LH levels. $#(Choice E)#  The circulating levels of other androgens such as DHEA, DHEAS, and androstenedione are also not affected by FSH. $#Educational objective# LH stimulates the release of testosterone from the Leydig cells of the testes; FSH stimulates the release of inhibin B from the Sertoli cells in the seminiferous tubules.

The hypothalamus releases thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), which triggers release of TSH from the pituitary.  TSH stimulates secretion of thyroid hormone from the thyroid, which in turn inhibits release of both TRH and TSH.  Thyroid hormone exists in 2 primary forms:  T4 (thyroxine), the predominant form secreted by the thyroid, and T3 (triiodothyronine), the more active form produced mainly by deiodination of T4 in peripheral tissues. $This patient has a very typical presentation of #primary hypothyroidism# with weight gain, fatigue, and a delayed relaxation phase of deep tendon reflexes.  Her diffuse goiter suggests chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto) thyroiditis, which is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in developed countries.  As autoimmune destruction of the gland progresses, thyroid hormone production declines, leading to loss of feedback inhibition of TSH secretion; therefore, patients have #low T4# and #elevated TSH# levels.  However, because T3 is produced mainly in peripheral tissues and has a short half-life, serum T3 levels fluctuate widely and correlate poorly with clinical status; #T3 is often normal# in primary hypothyroidism. $#(Choice B)#  TSH secretion is very sensitive to changes in thyroid status and rises in response to even small declines in thyroid hormone production.  Subclinical hypothyroidism is a common biochemical state in which an elevated TSH is necessary to maintain normal thyroid hormone levels.  However, most patients are asymptomatic. $#(Choices C, E, and F)#  Primary hyperthyroidism (eg, Graves disease) is characterized by elevated thyroid hormone levels and suppressed TSH.  Subclinical hyperthyroidism is characterized by suppressed TSH with normal thyroid hormone levels.  Central (secondary) hyperthyroidism (eg, TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma) shows elevated levels of both TSH and thyroid hormone.  Common clinical features of hyperthyroidism (primary or secondary) include weight loss, heat intolerance, and tachycardia; patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism may be asymptomatic or have mild symptoms.  T3 levels correlate with clinical status in hyperthyroidism more closely than in hypothyroidism and are often elevated. $#(Choice D)#  Euthyroid sick syndrome is a constellation of abnormal thyroid tests seen in patients with severe systemic illness (eg, sepsis).  Excess cortisol, inflammatory cytokines, starvation, and certain medications (eg, amiodarone) can cause reduced conversion of T4 to T3, leading to low serum T3; reverse T3 (the inactive metabolite of T4) is typically elevated but TSH and T4 are usually normal. $#Educational objective# Primary hypothyroidism is characterized by decreased T4 levels and increased TSH.  T3 is primarily produced by conversion from T4 in peripheral tissues; serum levels widely fluctuate due to its short half life, and can often be within the normal range in patients with hypothyroidism.

  "explanation_2": "$#Menopause# is defined by the permanent cessation of menses for #12 months# and is a normal event of aging caused by exhaustion of ovarian follicles.  The mean age of menopause in the United States is 51.  Ovarian failure before age 35 is considered premature.  During the menopausal transition, #FSH levels increase# due to resistant ovarian follicles and lack of feedback from inhibin.  Absence of menstrual cycles with associated #hypoestrogenic symptoms# (eg, hot flashes, vaginal dryness) is highly suggestive of menopause.  Menopause is typically diagnosed clinically.  However, if the diagnosis is unclear, an elevated serum FSH level can be used for diagnosis as it is a reliable early indicator. $Cyclic and continuous oral contraceptive (OC) regimens are not associated with irregular menses or amenorrhea, and premenopausal patients who stop taking OCs should expect spontaneous return of menses.  This patient's age and vaginal dryness make menopausal transition the most likely cause of amenorrhea.  OCs may mask vasomotor symptoms that are typical of menopausal transition, and the patient was likely having iatrogenic withdrawal bleeding. $#(Choice A)#  A urine pregnancy test should be performed for any female of reproductive age with amenorrhea.  A negative test is a reliable indicator that the patient is not pregnant.  Serum β-hCG testing is indicated in cases when the absolute value of the β-hCG would aid in diagnosis and treatment, such as in ectopic or molar pregnancies. $#(Choices B and D)#  Estradiol and progesterone levels gradually decrease during the menopausal transition due to decreasing ovarian function.  Serum estradiol measurement is not a reliable indicator of menopause due to typical fluctuations and gradual decline.  After menopause, estrone is produced outside the ovaries and replaces estradiol as the predominant circulating estrogen. $#(Choice E)#  Serum prolactin levels are much less significantly changed during menopause than are FSH levels.  Amenorrhea due to a prolactinoma would be diagnosed by detecting an elevated prolactin level.  Additional symptoms can include galactorrhea and headache, which this patient does not have. $#Educational objective# Menopause occurs on average at age 51 and is diagnosable retrospectively  after 12 months of amenorrhea.  An elevated serum FSH level confirms the diagnosis.  "

Insulin mRNA codes for #preproinsulin#, a larger precursor molecule that begins with a hydrophobic N-terminal signal peptide.

  "explanation_2": "$#Gonadotropin-releasing hormone# (GnRH) is a polypeptide that is normally released from the anterior hypothalamus in a pulsatile manner.  GnRH is carried to the anterior pituitary via the portal circulation, where it stimulates FSH and LH production.  #Pulsatile# stimulation of pituitary gonadotrophin cells by GnRH leads to upregulation of GnRH receptors and enhanced FSH and LH secretion.  FSH and LH are responsible for development of the dominant follicle in the ovaries.  Optimal frequency and amplitude of GnRH pulses are crucial for FSH and LH release and subsequent ovulation. $#Anovulation# due to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is a common form of #infertility# that can be treated by pulsatile administration of GnRH.  GnRH has a very short half-life and is given by a programmable pump that delivers a predetermined dose at physiologic intervals.  Ovulation occurs in most patients in 10-20 days.  Signs of ovulation include loss of a dominant follicle on ultrasound, surge in urine LH levels, rise in serum progesterone levels, and rise in basal body temperature. $#(Choices A, B, D, and E)#  Constant, rather than pulsatile, GnRH activity causes down-regulation of the GnRH receptors on pituitary gonadotrophin cells, which suppresses LH and FSH secretion.  Although it is possible to use a pump to administer GnRH at a steady rate, it has a very short half-life, and long-acting GnRH analogs (eg, leuprolide) are easier to use and can be given monthly by intramuscular injection.  Long-acting GnRH analog therapy is used when suppression of gonadal function is desired, such as in certain patients with prostate cancer, endometriosis, precocious puberty, or premenopausal breast cancer. $#Educational objective# Pulsatile administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulates FSH and LH release and is useful for the treatment of infertility.  Nonpulsatile (constant) infusion of GnRH, or a long-acting analog, suppresses FSH and LH release and subsequently suppresses gonadal function.  "

The incidence of cataracts increases with #age#; other risk factors include smoking, excessive sunlight exposure, #diabetes mellitus#, and glucocorticoid use.  In this patient, long-term hyperglycemia most likely contributed to cataract formation by causing #oversaturation of the polyol pathway#. $The first step in the polyol pathway (an alternative route of glucose metabolism) is the conversion of glucose into sorbitol by aldose reductase.  Sorbitol cannot readily cross cell membranes and is therefore trapped inside the cells where it forms.  The second enzyme in the pathway, sorbitol dehydrogenase, is able to #convert sorbitol into fructose# at a sufficient rate to prevent accumulation when glucose levels are normal.  However, the process is slow; in long-standing hyperglycemia, sorbitol accumulates in tissues with lower sorbitol dehydrogenase activity, such as the retina, lens, kidney, and peripheral nerves. $#Sorbitol accumulation# increases cellular #osmotic and oxidative stress# and contributes to the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy.  In lens cells, the increased stress leads to the development of hydropic lens fibers that degenerate, eventually resulting in lens opacification and cataract formation. $#(Choices B and C)#  Another function of aldose reductase is the conversion of galactose into galactitol (ie, this enzyme converts sugars into their corresponding sugar alcohols).  Galactitol production via this pathway is normally insignificant.  In galactosemia (galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase deficiency), an increased amount of galactitol is produced, resulting in congenital cataracts. $#(Choice D)#  The end product of sorbitol metabolism in most cells is fructose (not glucose), which is then excreted by the cells and taken up by the liver to produce glucose and triglycerides. $#(Choice E)#  Xylulose is an intermediate in the pentose phosphate pathway, which is used to generate NADPH (for cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis) and ribose 5-phosphate (for nucleotide synthesis). $#Educational objective# In the polyol pathway, aldose reductase converts glucose into sorbitol, which is slowly metabolized into fructose by sorbitol dehydrogenase.  Chronic hyperglycemia overwhelms this pathway, causing intracellular sorbitol accumulation and increased osmotic/oxidative stress.  This accelerates cataract development in patients with diabetes, and contributes to the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy.  ",

Individuals with this condition are typically treated with #growth hormone# (GH) when growth failure becomes evident, leading to normalization of height in most patients. $GH promotes growth by acting on the cell surface receptors that stimulate production of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), primarily in the liver.  One GH molecule binds to 2 receptors on the cell surface, leading to activation of #Janus kinase (JAK)#, a #nonreceptor tyrosine kinase#.  JAK subsequently phosphorylates several tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain of the GH receptor.  These phosphorylated tyrosine residues function as docking sites for #STAT# (#signal transducer and activator of transcription#).  Once STAT is recruited to the receptor, it is also phosphorylated by JAK.

HSL is activated in response to stress hormones (eg, catecholamines, glucagon, ACTH), whereas it is inhibited by the release of insulin.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient in #diabetic ketoacidosis# is experiencing increased triglyceride breakdown in adipose tissue due to her insulin deficiency.  Triglycerides stored in adipose tissue are metabolized to free fatty acids and #glycerol# by hormone-sensitive lipase in response to low insulin and high catecholamine levels.  Adipocytes are unable to metabolize glycerol, so it is secreted into the circulation and transported to the liver, where it is phosphorylated to glycerol-3-phosphate by #glycerol kinase#.  Glycerol-3-phosphate is subsequently converted by glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase to dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), which can be used to produce #glucose# through #gluconeogenesis#. $#(Choice A)#  Acetyl CoA carboxylase is a biotin-dependent enzyme present in both liver and adipose tissues.  It catalyzes the first committed step in fatty acid synthesis, the conversion of acetyl CoA to malonyl CoA. $#(Choice B)#  Fatty acids must first be activated by acyl CoA synthetase in the cytoplasm in order to undergo beta-oxidation in mitochondria.  Although beta-oxidation of fatty acids is increased in diabetic ketoacidosis, the resulting acetyl-CoA is used for energy and ketone body formation (not glucose production). $#(Choice C)#  In contrast to fatty acid oxidation, which occurs in mitochondria, fatty acid synthesis occurs in the cytosol.  Acetyl CoA generated in mitochondria during glycolysis is transferred to the cytosol as citrate.  In the cytoplasm, ATP citrate lyase converts citrate back into acetyl CoA that can be used for fatty acid chain elongation. $#(Choice D)#  Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase is the first enzyme of the hexose monophosphate (HMP) shunt.  The HMP shunt produces pentose sugars for nucleotide synthesis and NADPH, which is necessary for cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis. $#Educational objective# Glycerol produced by the degradation of triglycerides in adipose tissue can be used by glycerol kinase in the liver and kidney to synthesize glucose during gluconeogenesis.

His family reports that the patient did not feel good last night and skipped dinner, but he still took his usual dose of insulin.  Paramedics find that his fingerstick blood glucose is 32 mg/dL and immediately administer intramuscular glucagon.  Glucagon binds to a transmembrane receptor in hepatocytes, which promotes binding of intracellular GTP to a specific receptor-associated protein.  This leads to further downstream signaling and rapid metabolic changes within hepatocytes, including a rapid decrease in intracellular glycogen stores and release of glucose into the blood.

G protein is a heterotrimer consisting of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits associated with the intracellular domain of these transmembrane receptors.  The alpha subunit of the inactivated G protein is bound to GDP.  On #receptor activation#, the alpha subunit undergoes a conformational change, which releases GDP and binds GTP.  #GTP binding# allows the alpha subunit to dissociate from the remainder of the G protein complex. $There are multiple subtypes of alpha G proteins, each with different secondary effects.  A specific alpha subunit known as #Gs# (present in glucagon, TSH, and PTH receptor complexes) #activates adenylate cyclase# when released from the G protein complex.  Adenylate cyclase converts ATP to #cAMP#, which activates #protein kinase A#.  Protein kinase A phosphorylates specific serine/threonine residues in various enzymes, leading to their activation or deactivation.  Protein kinase A also phosphorylates proteins that bind to the regulatory regions of genes on DNA. $#(Choice A)#  cGMP activates protein kinase G, which mediates a number of intracellular effects (eg, smooth muscle relaxation, platelet activation, sperm metabolism).  cGMP is inactivated by cGMP phosphodiesterase, which cleaves cGMP in the corpus cavernosum of the penis and regulates penile erection.  Drugs that inhibit cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase (eg, sildenafil) are used in the treatment of erectile dysfunction. $#(Choice B)#  Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK) is a cytoplasmic protein activated by ligand binding to non-G protein-coupled transmembrane receptors that lack intrinsic @tyrosine kinase@ activity.  Growth hormone, erythropoietin, and cytokines (eg, interferon) are common ligands for these receptors.  JAKs activate cytoplasmic transcription factors called STATs (signal transducers and activators of transcription), which enter the nucleus to promote gene transcription. $#(Choice C)#  cAMP is cleaved by the enzyme cAMP phosphodiesterase to its inactive form, 5'-AMP.  Drugs that inhibit cAMP phosphodiesterase lead to prolongation of the actions of cAMP.  An example is the use of theophylline in bronchial asthma. $#(Choice E)#  Ligands such as insulin and epidermal growth factor act through transmembrane receptors that have intrinsic tyrosine kinase domains. $#Educational objective# Protein kinase A is responsible for the intracellular effects of the G protein-mediated adenylate cyclase second messenger system.

It is common in the intensive care unit and is typically seen in those with sepsis and other severe infections, burns, trauma, or major hemorrhage. $Severe metabolic stress is associated with increased production of #cortisol#, #catecholamines# (primarily epinephrine and norepinephrine), glucagon, and proinflammatory cytokines (eg, IL-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha).  Cortisol, catecholamines, and glucagon act on the liver to #increase glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis#, stimulating release of glucose from the liver into the blood. $In addition, the release of proinflammatory cytokines is associated with increased expression of glucose transporter (GLUT) 1 in the CNS and macrophages, along with decreased expression of GLUT4 (which mediates insulin-induced glucose uptake in peripheral tissues).  This facilitates #increased glucose uptake by the brain #and #immune cells# responsible for fighting infection. $#(Choice A)#  During trauma resuscitation, most patients are given isotonic fluids (eg, normal saline, Ringer lactate), which are unlikely to cause hyperglycemia.  Even if mild fluid-induced hyperglycemia occurs, blood glucose levels typically normalize quickly after fluid boluses. $#(Choice B)#  Norepinephrine stimulates peripheral lipolysis, releasing glycerol, which can be taken up by the liver for use in gluconeogenesis.  Therefore, stress increases, not decreases, the hepatic glycerol supply. $#(Choice C)#  Severe illness is often associated with increased anaerobic glycolysis due to systemic or local tissue hypoxia (blood loss in this patient).  Increased conversion of glucose to lactate in ischemic tissues raises plasma lactate levels.  Glucose levels are often concurrently elevated due to stress hyperglycemia, but anaerobic glycolysis itself depletes glucose. $#(Choice E)#  The renal cortex can convert lactate to glucose via gluconeogenesis.  However, it makes a significantly smaller contribution to circulating glucose levels than hepatic gluconeogenesis. $#Educational objective# Stress hyperglycemia is transiently elevated blood glucose levels in the context of severe illness (eg, sepsis, burns, major hemorrhage) in patients without preexisting diabetes mellitus.

  "explanation_2": "#Congenital hypothyroidism# is one of the most common causes of preventable intellectual disability.  Most cases are due to thyroid dysgenesis (agenesis, hypoplasia, or ectopy), and iodine deficiency is a common cause in areas endemic for iodine deficiency (eg, Europe). $Neonates initially have no significant symptoms due to the presence of maternal thyroxine (T4) from transplacental transfer.  T4 is responsible for the stimulation of protein synthesis as well as carbohydrate and lipid catabolism in many cells; as maternal T4 wanes, metabolism is impaired and marked by a slowing of physical and mental activity (lethargy, poor feeding, constipation, hypotonia).  Accumulation of matrix substances cutaneously and internally results in nonpitting edema (eg, \"#puffy#\" face), @umbilical hernia@, protruding tongue, and a large anterior fontanelle.  In addition, T4 is essential for normal brain development and myelination during early life, and infants are at risk of severe and #irreversible intellectual disability#. $Treatment with #levothyroxine# by age 2 weeks can normalize cognitive and physical development. $Therefore, universal newborn screening for congenital hypothyroidism is performed in the United States but not in all other countries. $#(Choice A)#  Infants who are fed honey or exposed to spores from the soil are at risk for infantile botulism, which presents with constipation and flaccid paralysis.  A large anterior fontanelle, umbilical hernia, and macroglossia are not seen. $#(Choice B)#  Hypotonia and hypothyroidism are features of @Down syndrome@.  However, the absence of other dysmorphic features (eg, upslanting palpebral fissures, bilateral epicanthal folds, single palmar crease) makes Down syndrome unlikely in this patient. $#(Choice C)#  Galactosemia is caused by galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase deficiency.  Patients with this condition present with jaundice, vomiting, hepatomegaly, and lethargy after ingesting galactose in breast milk or formula in the first few days of life.  This patient was previously breastfeeding well and has no hepatomegaly. $#(Choice D)#  Hirschsprung disease is caused by abnormal migration of neural crest cells into the rectosigmoid colon.  The lack of ganglion cells in this colon segment impedes gastrointestinal motility, resulting in failed meconium passage and bilious emesis in a newborn. $#(Choice F)#  Phenylketonuria is most commonly caused by phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency, resulting in hyperphenylalaninemia.  It presents with developmental delay, light pigmentation, and a musty body odor. $#Educational objective# Congenital hypothyroidism is usually asymptomatic at birth.  After maternal T4 wanes, infants develop constipation, lethargy, hypotonia, macroglossia, an umbilical hernia, and a large anterior fontanelle.  ",
