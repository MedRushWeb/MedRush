He quit smoking, which is the single most important intervention for decreasing his risk.  In addition to combustible tobacco, several #environmental carcinogens# have been definitively linked to lung cancer.  The most significant of these is #radon# (222Rn), a colorless, odorless, #radioactive# gas produced from the decay of uranium, found throughout the earth. $Radon enters structures through subterranean cracks and contaminated groundwater and accumulates in the @lower levels@ of the home (eg, #basements#).  Radon is unstable and undergoes nuclear decay, emitting radiation in the form of alpha particles.  Although they have minimal penetration in human tissue (< 50 microns), alpha particles are the most potent form of DNA-damaging ionizing radiation.  Because radon gas is #inhaled#, the respiratory tract epithelium is most susceptible to mutagenesis. $Radon is the second-leading cause of lung cancer in the US and the leading environmental risk factor for #lung cancer in nonsmokers#.  The risk is multiplied in current or previous smokers.  Radon testing and mitigation (eg, negative soil depressurization to prevent upward gas seepage) are recommended by multiple federal agencies and medical societies. $#(Choice A)#  Reactive metabolites of benzene (benzoquinones) cause oxidative DNA damage; benzene is a carcinogen implicated in hematologic neoplasms (eg, acute leukemias).  The main domestic source of benzene exposure is cigarette smoke.  Organic solvents (eg, paint thinners, lacquers) contain low levels of benzene and can irritate the mucosae (eg, conjunctivitis, nonspecific respiratory tract inflammation) but are not clearly linked to lung cancer. $#(Choices B and D)#  Bird ownership (eg, parrots) and mold spores (eg, Penicillium spp., Aspergillus spp.) can predispose to hypersensitivity pneumonitis, a type IV inflammatory lung disease (granulomatous, T-lymphocyteâ€“driven) that can transition into pulmonary fibrosis if untreated.  However, it does not cause oncogenic DNA damage. $#(Choice C)#  Bisphenol A is a polycarbonate compound that is ubiquitous in consumer goods (eg, plastic containers).  It is classified as an endocrine-disrupting chemical, functioning as mixed estrogen agonist-antagonist and has been linked to an array of reproductive (eg, decreased spermatogenesis, decreased ovarian follicle mass) and cardiometabolic (eg, insulin resistance) disorders. $#Educational objective# Radon is a radioactive gas found throughout the earth that enters homes through contaminated soil and groundwater.  It emits highly ionizing alpha radiation, causing DNA damage in the respiratory tract epithelium when inhaled.

Interspersed goblet cells produce mucus that traps inhaled debris.  The ciliated and goblet cells of respiratory epithelium are together responsible for mucociliary clearance. $ In response to #chronic irritation#, such as #smoking#, the respiratory epithelium may be replaced with squamous epithelium.  This change of cell types is called #squamous metaplasia# and is seen histologically as a transition to stratified polygonal epithelial cells.  This transition is initially @adaptive@ because squamous cells are more resistant to irritation than columnar cells.  However, the lack of cilia and goblet cells prevents effective mucociliary clearance and increases the risk of respiratory infections.  Squamous bronchial metaplasia is reversible and may resolve on discontinuation of smoking, but persistent irritant exposure can cause progression to dysplasia or squamous cell carcinoma. $ Other examples of metaplasia include @Barrett esophagus@, in which esophageal squamous epithelium is replaced by intestinal columnar epithelium with goblet cells in response to chronic acid exposure, and squamous metaplasia of the cervix. $ (Choice B)  Cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) is almost always caused by oncogenic strains of human papillomavirus (HPV) that integrate into the host cell genome.  Although HPV infects the metaplastic epithelium at the cervical transformation zone, development of CSCC is primarily driven by the expression of viral genes that inactivate host tumor-suppressor proteins. $ (Choice C)  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is an autosomal dominant disease caused by defects in the contractile proteins of the cardiac sarcomere.

Such tumors often arise in the #superior sulcus# (groove formed by the subclavian vessels).  The apical location allows for extensive local tumor spread.  Invasion of surrounding structures can cause the following: $â€¢ #Shoulder pain# radiating toward the axilla and scapula (#most common# presenting symptom).  It occurs due to involvement of the lower brachial plexus.  Other associated symptoms include arm paresthesia, weakness, and muscle atrophy. $â€¢ #Horner syndrome# occurs due to involvement of the cervical sympathetic ganglia.  Symptoms include ipsilateral ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis. $â€¢ Upper extremity edema may be due to compression of subclavian vessels. $â€¢ #Spinal cord compression# and paraplegia can result from tumor extension into the intervertebral foramina. $#(Choice A)#  Squamous cell carcinoma is associated with parathyroid-related peptide secretion and hypercalcemia.  Cushing syndrome and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion can accompany small cell carcinoma of the lung. $#(Choice B)#  Centrally located lung cancers (squamous cell and small cell carcinomas) frequently obstruct the main bronchi, producing dyspnea and cough.  Airway obstruction would not cause shoulder pain or muscle atrophy. $#(Choice C)#  Anterior mediastinal masses include thymoma, teratoma, thyroid cancer, and (terrible) lymphoma (\"terrible Ts\").  They are less likely to lead to hemoptysis or brachial plexus involvement. $#(Choice D)#  Lung cancers are associated with a number of autoimmune syndromes, most commonly Lambert-Eaton (progressive proximal muscle weakness, often in the legs). $#(Choice E)#  Pericardial effusions are characterized by dyspnea, distended neck veins, distant heart sounds, and - particularly if tamponade is present - pulsus paradoxus (decrease in systolic blood pressure >10 mm Hg during inspiration). $#(Choice F)#  A pleural effusion can lead to dyspnea and irritate the mediastinal and diaphragmatic pleura, causing referred shoulder pain (via the phrenic nerve); however, it would not cause hemoptysis. $#Educational objective# Tumors located in the lung apex (superior sulcus) are called Pancoast tumors.  Invasion of surrounding structures can lead to ipsilateral Horner syndrome, rib destruction, atrophy of hand muscles, and pain in the distribution of C8, T1, and T2 nerve roots.  "},

This presentation is concerning for #adenocarcinoma# of the lung, the #most common lung cancer# in the general population, #women#, and #nonsmokers#. Although tobacco is the most significant risk factor, the etiology in nonsmokers is thought to be multifactorial. Risk factors include environmental exposures (eg, radon, second-hand smoke) and underlying lung disease. In addition, certain molecular alterations are seen more commonly in nonsmokers; these 'driver mutations' are thought to be responsible for the development of the malignancy and include epidermal growth factor receptor (#EGFR#) mutations and #ALK gene rearrangements#. KRAS mutations, another driver in the formation of adenocarcinoma, are seen more commonly in smokers. $Adenocarcinoma typically presents with cough, weight loss, and hemoptysis. Changes to the distal extremities, including #clubbing# (@increased curvature@ of the nail plate) and hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (proliferation of the bones, skin, and nails of the fingers), may occur and are thought to be due to tumor-derived growth factors. The tumor tends to be #located peripherally# (as in this patient) and may present as a nodule, mass, or obstructive pneumonia. Like all malignancies, metastatic disease to the pleura can cause pleural effusions. $#(Choice B)# Bronchial carcinoid is a rare malignancy that tends to be located centrally, within or adjacent to large bronchi. It typically presents with wheezing due to bronchial obstruction and occasionally also causes carcinoid syndrome (ie, episodic diarrhea, flushing, bronchospasm). $#(Choice C)# Mesothelioma most commonly arises from the mesothelium lining the pleural cavity; tumors are pleural based (ie, pleural mass with associated pleural effusion, pleural thickening), rather than intraparenchymal. In addition, it is extremely rare in nonsmokers with no history of asbestos exposure. $#(Choice D)# Small cell carcinoma is strongly associated with smoking; only 1% of cases occur in nonsmokers. It arises from the basal cells of the bronchial epithelium and displays some neuroendocrine features. Small cell carcinoma usually occurs in major bronchi. $#(Choice E)# Squamous cell carcinoma is also strongly associated with smoking. It usually affects larger bronchi (centrally located) and arises from areas of squamous bronchial metaplasia. $#Educational objective# Adenocarcinoma is the most common primary lung cancer in the general population, women, and nonsmokers. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations and ALK gene rearrangements are seen more commonly in nonsmokers and thought to contribute to disease formation in this subgroup. Adenocarcinoma is typically located peripherally and may be associated with clubbing or hypertrophic osteoarthropathy.","clickable_1":"images/img1.554.jpg"}
