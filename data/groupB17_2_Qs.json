SSRIs block the reuptake of serotonin into the presynaptic neuron, leading to an immediate increase in availability of synaptic serotonin and a subsequent cascade of downstream neurobiological effects. $#(Choice A)#  In the central nervous system, acetylcholine is involved primarily in arousal, memory, and learning.  Degeneration of cholinergic neurons is associated with Alzheimer dementia. $#(Choices B and D)#  There is evidence for dysfunction of the dopamine and glutamate (primary excitatory neurotransmitter) systems in the pathogenesis of OCD; however, neither neurotransmitter is a significant target of first-line medications. $#(Choices C and E)#  Gamma-aminobutyric acid is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system and is involved in the anti-anxiety effects of benzodiazepines.  Glycine is also an inhibitory neurotransmitter. $#(Choice F)#  Histamine is a neurotransmitter involved in maintaining wakefulness and, as a result, drugs with antihistamine properties may be sedating. $#(Choice G)#  Norepinephrine is a catecholamine involved in mood, anxiety, alertness, learning, and memory. $#Educational objective# Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by persistent, intrusive thoughts leading to repetitive, ritualistic behaviors.  Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are considered first-line treatment for OCD and exert their effects by inhibiting serotonin reuptake.  "}
