        "explanation_2": "This patient likely has developed amenorrhea and galactorrhea as an adverse effect of dopamine-2 (D2) receptor blockade from treatment with antipsychotics.  There are 4 major @dopaminergic pathways@ in the brain (eg, mesolimbic, mesocortical, tuberoinfundibular, nigrostriatal); dopamine hyperactivity in the mesolimbic pathway is associated with positive psychotic symptoms (eg hallucinations, delusions). $The side effects of antipsychotic therapy are largely caused by D2 receptor blockade in other dopaminergic pathways.  The #tuberoinfundibular pathway# connects the hypothalamus to the pituitary gland and is responsible for the tonic inhibition of prolactin secretion.  Neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus secrete dopamine, which binds to D2 receptors on pituitary lactotrophs, resulting in decreased prolactin secretion from the anterior pituitary gland.  Antipsychotics can interrupt the tuberoinfundibular pathway, causing increased blood prolactin levels #(hyperprolactinemia)#, which may lead to #galactorrhea# (milky nipple discharge unrelated to pregnancy/breastfeeding) and menstrual irregularities (eg, #amenorrhea#). $(Choice A)  The arcuate fasciculus is a neural pathway that connects the Broca and Wernicke areas, which are responsible for expressive and receptive language, respectively.  Disruption of the arcuate fasciculus classically results in conduction aphasia, characterized by fluent speech, intact comprehension, and impaired repetition. $(Choice B)  The hypothalamospinal tract projects from the hypothalamus to the ciliospinal center of the intermediolateral cell column (T1-L2), providing sympathetic innervation to the ipsilateral eye and face.  Disruption of this tract typically results in ipsilateral Horner syndrome (eg, ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis).  $(Choice C)  The lateral medullary spinothalamic tract transmits pain and temperature signals from the contralateral body to the thalamus.  Lateral medullary infarction (Wallenberg syndrome) presents with loss of pain and temperature sensation on the contralateral body and ipsilateral face as well as vertigo, hoarseness, dysphagia, and abnormal eye movements.$(Choice D)  The therapeutic effect of antipsychotics arises from blockade D2 receptors in the mesolimbic pathway.$(Choice E)  The nigrostriatal pathway projects from the substantia nigra to the caudate nucleus and putamen and primarily regulates the coordination of voluntary movements.  D2 receptor blockade in this pathway results in extrapyramidal effects (eg, dystonia, akathisia, tardive dyskinesia) and drug-induced parkinsonism. $Educational objective Antipsychotic medications work by blocking dopamine-2 receptors in the mesolimbic dopamine pathway.  Dopamine-2 receptor blockade in the tuberoinfundibular pathway can result in galactorrhea and amenorrhea.",

      "explanation_2": "This patient's normal development through age 10 months followed by regression (eg, loss of babbling and motor control) and development of hand wringing is characteristic of #Rett syndrome#, a neurodevelopmental disorder that occurs mainly in girls.  Most cases are due to de novo mutations in the X-linked MECP2 gene.  Rett syndrome is characterized by normal development until #age 6-18 months#, followed by a #loss of motor and language skills# and the development of #stereotypic hand movements#.  #Deceleration of head growth# is a classic feature of Rett syndrome and can be an early sign.  Other features include seizures, intellectual disability, autistic features, and breathing abnormalities. $ There is no specific therapy for Rett syndrome; many patients survive well into adulthood with severe, permanent neurologic deficits. $ (Choice A)  Features of Angelman syndrome include a happy disposition, jerky gait, and hand flapping.  Development is commonly delayed rather than initially normal. $ (Choice B)  Although this patient has deficits in verbal communication and stereotypical hand movements, she does not display other features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) such as deficits in social reciprocity, emotional restriction, or repetitive interests.  She plays and snuggles with family and appears to be trying to interact with the doctor. $ (Choice C)  Fragile X syndrome mainly affects males and is associated with CGG trinucleotide repeats on the X chromosome.  Features include intellectual disability; a long, narrow face; large protruding ears; macrocephaly; and macroorchidism. $ (Choice D)  Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is an X-linked recessive disorder characterized by a deficiency in HGPRT (hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase), leading to an increase in uric acid levels.  Although hypotonia and involuntary movements such as hand wringing may be present, developmental milestones are typically delayed rather than normal.  Gout and self-mutilating behaviors (eg, lip and finger biting) are commonly seen. $ (Choice F)  Tay-Sachs disease is a lysosomal storage disease caused by a deficiency in beta-hexosaminidase A (Hex A).  Like Rett syndrome, it presents with a regression of motor skills, but it typically begins earlier (age 2-6 months) and is associated with macrocephaly and a cherry red spot on the macula. $ Educational objective Rett syndrome is characterized by loss of speech and motor skills, deceleration of head growth, and stereotypic purposeless hand movements after a period of normal development.  It affects mainly girls and is associated with mutations in the MECP2 gene."

Common symptoms of conversion disorder may include weakness, paralysis, gait disturbance, blindness, diplopia, aphonia, anesthesia, or nonepileptic seizures (also called psychogenic seizures). $ The phenomenon of la belle indifférence (ie, incongruous lack of concern about symptoms) has been associated with conversion disorder but is not pathognomonic, occurs at equal frequency in true neurological disorders, and should not be used to make the diagnosis.  In fact, patients with conversion disorder may be very distressed by their symptoms. $ (Choice A)  Body dysmorphic disorder involves an excessive preoccupation with perceived defects in physical appearance (eg, nose shape) as opposed to a neurologic deficit (eg, leg weakness). $ (Choice C)  In factitious disorder, patients deliberately falsify symptoms due to their desire to assume the sick role.  There is no evidence that this patient is intentionally falsifying her symptoms, and given her recent stress (eg, her father's heart attack), conversion disorder is more likely. $ (Choice D)  Illness anxiety disorder is characterized by excessive fears of having a serious physical disease.  The fear is usually due to misinterpretation of bodily symptoms or normal functions (eg, a man with gas pain becoming preoccupied with having colon cancer). $ (Choice E)  Malingering is the purposeful falsification of symptoms for obvious external benefit (eg, a patient feigning hemiparesis to receive disability benefits). $ (Choice F)  Somatic symptom disorder is characterized by excessive and persistent health anxiety and preoccupation with multiple somatic symptoms; it does not present with a clearly incompatible neurological examination.  This patient does not express any concern about her impairment and seeks care only when brought in by her roommate, effectively ruling out somatic symptom disorder. $ Educational objective Conversion disorder is characterized by neurologic symptoms and examination findings that are incompatible with a known neurological disease.  Patients do not consciously produce the symptoms like in factitious disorder or malingering, and the condition may cause significant distress/impairment."

      "explanation_2": "Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (#MAOIs#) (eg, phenelzine, tranylcypromine) are antidepressants that work by inhibiting oxidative deamination, thereby increasing the presynaptic availability of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine.  Due to their risk of severe adverse effects (eg, hypertensive crisis, serotonin syndrome), MAOIs are not considered first- or second-line antidepressant treatments.  However, MAOIs are still useful in certain situations when other antidepressants fail.  In addition to their role in #treatment-resistant major depressive disorder# (MDD), there is some evidence to suggest that they are superior to other classes of antidepressants in the treatment of MDD with atypical features. $ #MDD with atypical features# is characterized by #mood reactivity# (ie, mood improves in response to positive events), #leaden paralysis# (ie, patient's arms and legs feel extremely heavy), #rejection sensitivity# (ie, overly sensitive to slight criticism), and the reversed vegetative signs of #increased sleep and appetite#.  This patient is both treatment-resistant (failure of multiple antidepressant agents) and has atypical features, making him a good candidate for a trial of an MAOI. $ #(Choices A and C)#  The presence of psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions would be consistent with MDD with psychotic features.  This subtype of MDD requires the addition of an antipsychotic as it is unlikely to respond to an antidepressant alone. $ (Choice B)  Many antidepressants, including MAOIs, have sexual side effects that can worsen preexisting sexual dysfunction.  Bupropion and mirtazapine are antidepressants that do not cause sexual side effects. $ (Choice D)  Memory impairment would be a relative contraindication for use of an MAOI.  Patients taking MAOIs must be cognitively intact and remember to avoid tyramine-containing foods and drug-drug interactions that could lead to a hypertensive crisis or serotonin syndrome. $ (Choice F)  Rapid speech is a possible manic symptom that would raise concern about the presence of mixed depressive and manic symptoms.  Antidepressants, particularly MAOIs, are not indicated for patients exhibiting mixed features. $ Educational objective Monoamine oxidase inhibitors are particularly useful in patients with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder with atypical features.  Increased appetite and sleep, leaden paralysis, rejection sensitivity, and mood reactivity are hallmarks of the atypical subtype."

An essential feature for diagnosis of ASPD is evidence of #conduct disorder prior to age 15# (eg, this patient's history of truancy and vindictive behavior toward his teacher).$  Individuals with ASPD display consistent #irresponsibility# along with #impulsivity# and irritability, which may result in #physical aggression#.  Engagement in criminal activities (eg, theft, illegal occupations) and #lack of remorse# for transgressions are typical in this disorder. $ (Choice B)  Borderline personality disorder also consists of a pattern of impulsivity and manipulation.  These individuals have marked emotional lability, tend to be less physically aggressive, and display exploitative behaviors that are often driven by abandonment fears as opposed to personal gain and/or profit. $ (Choice C)  When individuals with conduct disorder continue to display a pattern of violating the rights of others into adulthood (age ≥18), they are diagnosed with ASPD. $ (Choice D)  Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is characterized by severe, persistent irritability in childhood, accompanied by frequent verbal and/or aggressive outbursts.  This diagnosis is usually restricted to individuals age <18. $ (Choice E)  Intermittent explosive disorder also consists of recurrent impulsive and destructive outbursts, but they are neither premeditated nor related to achieving secondary gain (eg, profit, intimidation). $ (Choice F)  Although this patient exhibits some grandiosity, lack of empathy, and exploitative behaviors that are also characteristic of narcissistic personality disorder, these would not explain his lifelong pattern of involvement in violent and/or criminal activities. $ (Choice G)  Oppositional defiant disorder similarly consists of irritability and vindictiveness as well as a lack of personal accountability for behaviors.  However, individuals with this disorder do not have a pattern of engaging in criminal activities. $ Educational objective Antisocial personality disorder involves a pattern of violating the rights of others, engaging in unlawful behaviors (eg, physical aggression, illegal occupations), and lacking remorse for transgressions.  Individuals must be age ≥18 for diagnosis and have a history of conduct disorder prior to age 15."

This patient's ≥2 weeks of depressed mood, impaired concentration, decreased appetite/weight loss, sleep disturbance, and suicidal ideation meet criteria for MDD, and his psychotic symptoms (eg, delusions of causing evil, auditory hallucinations) specify the psychotic features subtype.  Delusions and hallucinations are commonly mood congruent and have depressive themes (eg, deserved punishment, worthlessness, nihilism), although mood-incongruent psychotic symptoms (unrelated to depressive themes) can also occur. $ Differentiating MDD with psychotic features from MDD without psychotic features is important as treatment differs.  Patients with MDD with psychotic features require combined treatment with an #antidepressant and antipsychotic# or electroconvulsive therapy. $ (Choice A)  This patient has no history of mania or hypomania, thereby ruling out bipolar disorder. $ (Choice B)  In delusional disorder, patients experience delusions but no other psychotic symptoms for at least a month.

With negative reinforcement, desired behavior is strengthened through the removal of a negative outcome (eg, suffering a bad sunburn promotes application of sunscreen to prevent future sunburns). $ (Choice E)  Reaction formation is the unconscious transformation of an unacceptable impulse or emotion into its opposite (eg, if this patient tells her physician she enjoys clinic visits and acts extremely relaxed during the examination to defend against underlying anxiety). $ (Choice F)  Regression is a defense mechanism that involves unconsciously reverting to a less mature way of coping with difficulties (eg, if this patient starts sleeping with a stuffed animal to manage anxiety about an upcoming appointment). $ Educational objective Classical conditioning involves a neutral stimulus being repeatedly paired with a non-neutral stimulus that elicits a reflexive, unconditioned response.  Over time, the formerly neutral stimulus is able to evoke a conditioned response by itself in absence of the non-neutral stimulus."

It could be considered in the short-term treatment of this patient's anxiety while cognitive-behavioral therapy takes effect.

      "explanation_2": "$This patient's sadness, insomnia, and decreased appetite are consistent with a #normal grief reaction# precipitated by the loss of a loved one (bereavement).  In a normal grief reaction, the sadness revolves around #feelings of loss# and typically occurs in \"waves\" #intermixed# with #positive memories# of the deceased.  For most, the natural mourning process lasts 6-12 months and is followed by the integration of grief, in which the individual continues to feel transient but less pronounced sadness, and life plans/routines have adapted to living without the deceased. $ Normal grief can #resemble# a #major depressive episode# as both may include intense sadness, rumination about the loss, insomnia, poor appetite, and weight loss.  However, this woman's positive memories about her husband, ability to continue volunteering, and lack of other depressive symptoms (eg, hopelessness, feelings of low self-worth, guilt, suicidal ideation) make major depression less likely #(choice B)#.  A major depressive disorder can be diagnosed during a grief reaction if a sufficient number and severity of depressive symptoms are present. $ (Choice A)  Dependent personality disorder is diagnosed when there is a lifelong pattern of excessive need to be taken care of, leading to submissive, clingy behavior and fears of separation. $ (Choice D)  Persistent complex bereavement disorder (also known as complicated grief) is characterized by prolonged grief for >12 months, difficulty accepting the death, persistent yearning for the deceased, and inability to reengage with life.  This patient's symptom duration is within the range seen in normal grief and she is showing signs of adapting to living without the deceased. $ (Choice E)  Persistent depressive disorder is a chronic depression that persists for at least 2 years. $ (Choice F)  Although this patient witnessed her husband's accident and avoids cycling, her symptoms are not consistent with post-traumatic stress disorder as she is not re-experiencing the event (eg, nightmares, flashbacks) or having symptoms of trauma-related reactivity (eg, hypervigilance, heightened startle response). $ Educational objective Normal grief presents with symptoms similar to those of a major depressive episode.

Other examples of behaviors used to indirectly defuse hostile feelings include procrastination, forgetfulness, and purposeful inefficiency.

Conduct disorder is a psychiatric disorder of children and adolescents and is characterized by a pattern of behaviors that #violate major societal norms# or the #rights of others#.  Other behaviors seen in conduct disorder include bullying, frequent physical fights, using weapons (eg, bat, gun, knife), torturing animals, breaking into houses, and sexual coercion.  Conduct disorder generally presents in middle childhood to adolescence and is more common in boys.  Children with conduct disorder are at greater risk for developing antisocial personality disorder as adults. $ (Choice A)  Antisocial personality disorder is not diagnosed in individuals under age 18.  It involves a pattern of violation of basic societal rules and the rights of others and requires a history of some symptoms of conduct disorder before age 15. $ (Choice B)  This patient does not have enough inattentive and hyperactive symptoms to diagnose attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and his overall behavior is more characteristic of conduct disorder. $ (Choice D)  Aggression occurs in both conduct and intermittent explosive disorders.  However, in intermittent explosive disorder, aggression is not premeditated or committed to achieve a tangible objective (eg, money, power, intimidation).  This disorder would not explain this patient's stealing and fire setting. $ (Choice E)  Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) involves a pattern of angry/irritable mood and argumentative/defiant behavior toward authority figures.  Symptoms of ODD are less severe than those of conduct disorder.  ODD does not include physical aggression, stealing, or destruction of property, as seen in this patient. $ (Choice F)  Pyromania is characterized by intentional and repeated fire setting with no obvious motive; it does not involve other behaviors seen in conduct disorder (eg, lying, theft, cruelty to others).  A separate diagnosis of pyromania is not given when fire setting occurs as part of conduct disorder. $ Educational objective Conduct disorder involves a persistent pattern of violating major societal norms or the rights of others.  Behaviors include aggression toward people and animals, deceitfulness or theft, destruction of property, and serious violation of rules."

      "explanation_2": "$This patient's persistent desire to be female and significant #distress# at developing male secondary sexual characteristics are most consistent with #gender dysphoria# (GD).  Individuals with GD experience discomfort from the #incongruence# between their gender #identity# (eg, an internal sense of what one's gender is) and their #assigned gender# at birth (either boy or girl based on external sexual anatomy).  They often have a strong desire to live and be treated as another gender and become preoccupied with changing primary and secondary sexual characteristics.  Preferences for playmates or friends of another gender and for the attire and typical interests and activities of another gender are characteristic. $ Individuals with GD typically describe #identifying with another gender# since childhood or adolescence and frequently encounter bullying and discrimination.  Gender-diverse adolescents struggling with these issues benefit from early identification and support to promote positive outcomes. $ (Choice A)  Bisexuality is a form of sexual orientation defined as being attracted (sexually, romantically, and/or emotionally) to more than one gender.  Gender identity and expression (eg, behavior, clothing, hairstyle, makeup) are independent of an individual's sexual orientation. $(Choice B)  Body dysmorphic disorder is characterized by preoccupation with slight to nonexistent defects in physical appearance.  It is not diagnosed in patients who are preoccupied with changing only their primary and secondary sexual characteristics and who meet other diagnostic criteria for GD. $ (Choice C)  Fetishistic disorder involves sexual urges, fantasies, or behaviors that are focused on a nongenital body part or inanimate object, not including articles of clothing used in cross-dressing. $ (Choice E)  Transvestic disorder involves sexual arousal from cross-dressing.  Unlike in GD, individuals with transvestic disorder do not typically report a desire to be another gender. $ Educational objective Gender dysphoria is characterized by a strong and persistent desire to live and be treated as another gender, which causes distress or impairment.  It is often accompanied by a desire to change one's primary or secondary sexual characteristics."

      "explanation_2": "The resident's response to the patient is illustrative of #countertransference#, which consists of the physician or therapist's conscious and unconscious #reaction toward a patient# (eg, attitudes, thoughts, feelings, behaviors) that is #based on past personal relationships#.  Countertransference reactions can be positive (eg, physician takes extra time with a patient who resembles a beloved grandmother) or negative (eg, physician avoids a patient who resembles a critical parent). $ Countertransference can #interfere with medical judgment#.  In this case, the resident's negative emotions toward her father are activated when the patient dismisses her training and credentials.  The resident acts on her negative countertransference reaction and adopts an inappropriately authoritarian approach by terminating the conversation and ordering a medication.  Awareness of countertransference may prevent responses and behaviors (eg, yelling at a patient, ordering unnecessary medications/restraints, cutting an interview short) that could be harmful to patient care. $ (Choice B)  Passive aggression is a defense mechanism in which anger is expressed in a nonconfrontational manner.  Examples of passive aggressive behaviors include sarcasm, procrastination, and purposeful inefficiency. $ (Choice C)  Projection is a defense mechanism that involves misattributing one's own unacceptable feelings to another person (eg, a woman who is angry with her mother accuses her mother of being angry with her). $ (Choice D)  Reaction formation is a defense mechanism in which uncomfortable feelings are unconsciously transformed into their extreme opposites (eg, if this resident was excessively gracious to the patient to defend against underlying anger). $ (Choice E)  Regression is a defense mechanism that involves returning to an earlier level of functioning to alleviate psychological distress (eg, a child starts sucking his thumb after a sibling is born). $ (Choice F)  Transference refers to the redirection of a patient's emotions from a significant person in the past to that patient's current physician or therapist.  It may explain some patients' emotional responses to their physicians (eg, an elderly patient who feels an immediate sense of comfort and familiarity with a physician who resembles her daughter).  Transference is distinguished from countertransference by describing the patient's reaction to the provider, whereas countertransference refers to the provider's reaction to the patient. $ Educational objective Countertransference consists of a provider's response (eg, attitudes, thoughts, feelings, behaviors) toward a patient based on past personal relationships.  Countertransference can be positive or negative, conscious or unconscious; if unrecognized, it may have detrimental effects on patient care."

In contrast, the presence of sudden onset of symptoms from a precipitating event suggests an underlying cause that may allow for treatment and symptom improvement when the precipitant is addressed. $ (Choice C)  Although unclear, possible reasons for poorer outcomes in men include biological (ie, genetic influences, changes in brain structure, hormones) and psychosocial (ie, social support deficits, substance use, vocational pressures/expectations) differences. $ (Choice D)  Patients with childhood or adolescent onset typically have a more severe form of the illness and a worse prognosis; the early onset may be due to a neurodevelopmental process with a deteriorating course. $ Educational objective Favorable prognostic factors in schizophrenia include predominantly positive psychotic symptoms, acute onset (shorter prodrome) with an identifiable precipitant, and older age at onset."

Panic-like symptoms that occur as part of other disorders are typically triggered by, and limited to, specific situations. $ (Choice A)  Acute stress disorder involves exposure to a traumatic event followed by development of characteristic symptoms (eg, re-experiencing, avoidance, arousal) lasting from 3 days to 1 month. $ (Choice B)  Although this patient experiences work-related stress, her description of unexpected panic attacks at home makes panic disorder more likely.  Adjustment disorder requires that symptoms develop in response to an identifiable stressor and do not meet criteria for another mental disorder. $ (Choice C)  In generalized anxiety disorder, individuals experience chronic, excessive worry for at least 6 months about multiple issues (eg, work, health, finances), which may or may not precipitate panic attacks.  In panic disorder, the content of anxious thoughts is more specific (concern about having future panic attacks) and panic attacks are unexpected. $ (Choice E)  Patients with social anxiety disorder may experience panic attacks in response to social situations (identifiable stimulus) and fear negative evaluation by others rather than the panic symptoms themselves. $ (Choice F)  Specific phobia is characterized by fear of a specific object or situation, such as flying, heights, or animals.  Panic symptoms are triggered by the phobic stimulus and are not spontaneous. $ Educational objective Panic disorder involves recurrent, unexpected panic attacks characterized by an abrupt surge of fear accompanied by physical and cognitive symptoms.

It is classified as one of the dissociative disorders and should be differentiated from dissociative amnesia and dissociative identity disorder. $ Episodes of #depersonalization# are characterized by a feeling of #detachment# or estrangement #from the self# or a sense of being an outside observer of the self.  #Derealization# is a subjective sense of #detachment# or unreality regarding #surroundings#.  In contrast to psychotic disorders, reality testing is intact during these unusual experiences (ie, individuals may feel detached from their bodies but know this is not true). $ (Choice A)  Absence seizures typically begin in childhood and are frequently associated with staring, repetitive eyelid movements, automatisms, and lack of awareness of the episodes.$ (Choice B)  This patient's intact reality testing and absence of psychotic symptoms (eg, delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech and behavior) make brief psychotic disorder unlikely. $ #(Choices D and E)#  Dissociative amnesia involves gaps in autobiographical memory, usually associated with a traumatic event.  Dissociative identity disorder is a rare condition associated with severe trauma that involves fragmentation of identity into ≥2 distinct personality states. $ (Choice F)  Depersonalization/derealization is not diagnosed as a separate disorder when it occurs as a feature of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  However, this patient does not meet other criteria for PTSD: exposure to life-threatening trauma, intrusion (eg, nightmares, flashbacks), avoidance of reminders, and hyperarousal (eg, insomnia, hypervigilance). $ Educational objective Depersonalization/derealization disorder is a dissociative disorder involving recurrent episodes of feeling detached from one's body or surroundings and/or feelings of unreality."

      "explanation_2": "$This patient's persistent depressive symptoms at her 6-week postpartum visit (increasing fatigue/low energy, depressed mood/frequent tearfulness, sleep disturbance, poor appetite, feelings of worthlessness) are concerning for #postpartum depression# (PPD).  PPD is diagnosed using the #same diagnostic criteria# used to diagnose a #major depressive episode# (≥2 weeks of at least 5 of 9 symptoms that include #depressed mood# plus #SIGECAPS#: #S#leep disturbance, loss of #I#nterest, #G#uilt/worthlessness, low #E#nergy, impaired #C#oncentration, change in #A#ppetite, #P#sychomotor retardation or agitation, and #S#uicidal thoughts).  PPD is common, and all patients should be screened for postpartum depression at the 6-week postpartum visit.  Untreated postpartum depression is associated with impaired maternal-infant bonding and negatively impacts both maternal and infant health. $ (Choice A)  In acute stress disorder, exposure to a life-threatening trauma results in symptoms of reexperiencing (ie, intrusive memories, flashbacks), avoidance of reminders, negative mood, dissociation, and hyperarousal.  This patient had an uncomplicated delivery, and her symptoms are more consistent with a major depressive episode. $ (Choice B)  Although being a new parent is a significant stressor, adjustment disorder is diagnosed only if symptoms do not meet the criteria for another specific disorder, such as major depressive disorder. $ (Choice C)  This patient's anxiety revolves around her ability to parent and is a common feature of patients with PPD.  Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by pervasive anxiety about multiple issues lasting ≥6 months. $ (Choice D)  Mild sadness and anxiety are commonly experienced by mothers in response to the stress of taking care of a newborn (ie, postpartum blues).  This normal and self-limited response typically peaks at 5 days postpartum and resolves within 2 weeks.  However, this patient's symptoms have persisted beyond 2 weeks and are sufficient in number and severity to diagnose major depression. $ Educational objective Postpartum depression is diagnosed using the same diagnostic criteria used for major depressive episodes that occur outside the postpartum period.  It should be differentiated from postpartum blues, which is a milder and self-limited form of depression that peaks at 5 days and resolves within 2 weeks."

Transference emotions often originate from feelings toward early significant figures, particularly parents.

Positive transference plays a role in patients trusting their physicians as many patients have a positive expectation that doctors are compassionate caregivers (similar to their parents).  Patients who were abused as children sometimes have difficulty seeking care or complying with the care they receive due to negative expectations of being taken advantage of or being harmed by a caregiving figure. $ (Choice A)  In acting out, unconscious feelings or impulses are expressed through actions (eg, if this patient had impulsively broken items in the psychiatrist's office due to rage at his perceived abandonment). $ (Choice B)  In displacement, a person expresses unacceptable feelings intended for one person to a more neutral person or object (eg, if this patient did not express his anger to his father and instead berated the psychiatrist).  Because the patient disclosed his anger to his father directly, he would not be using displacement. $ (Choice C)  Projection involves misattributing one's own unacceptable feelings to another person (eg, if the patient were unable to acknowledge his disappointment toward his psychiatrist about canceling and instead perceived his psychiatrist as being upset with him). $ (Choice D)  In reaction formation, uncomfortable feelings are transformed into their opposites (eg, if this patient expressed deep appreciation for the psychiatrist's care rather than acknowledging his disappointment). $ (Choice E)  Regression is a defense mechanism in which an individual returns to an earlier level of functioning to alleviate psychological distress (eg, if the patient sulked and refused to speak rather than maturely discussing his feelings with the psychiatrist). $ Educational objective Transference is the unconscious shifting of emotions associated with a significant person from one's past to a person in the present."

Children develop an understanding of the concept of gender by age 3-4 and have a sense of the permanence of gender around age 5-6.  It is #developmentally normal# for them to explore the world by #engaging in activities# that may be culturally associated with the #opposite gender#.  It is important to follow a child's lead and allow this exploration to occur. $ In contrast to occasional play and exploration, if there is a prolonged and intense feeling that a person's gender does not match one's assigned birth sex, it is more likely to continue into puberty.  When this feeling is associated with #significant distress# it is diagnosed as #gender dysphoria#.  Patients with this condition have increased rates of psychiatric illness, including depression and anxiety, and need monitoring and support. $ (Choice B)  Although it is important to allow the child to play freely, this response does not answer the father's question and is unlikely to decrease his concern.  The father should be educated that his child's type of play is part of normal exploration. $ (Choice C)  It is normal for a child to explore gender activities.  There is no evidence that boys need increased exposure to male figures to understand their own gender. $ (Choice D)  Playing with dolls is consistent with normal explorative play, not gender dysphoria.  Further evaluation and professional support might be warranted in this child if he had a more persistent desire to be the opposite sex or disliked his own genitalia. $ (Choice E)  Children usually know their gender by age 4 and understand that it is permanent by age 5-6. $ Educational objective Although children understand the concept of gender by age 4, it is normal for them to explore activities culturally associated with the opposite gender.  In contrast, gender dysphoria is diagnosed when there is marked distress associated with a prolonged and intense feeling that one is a different gender from one's birth sex."

The mesolimbic pathway projects from the ventral tegmental area to various regions throughout the limbic system. $ The treatment of choice for schizophrenia is antipsychotic medication.  Most antipsychotics are dopamine antagonists that produce their therapeutic effects (ie, decreased intensity of delusions and hallucinations) by decreasing dopamine activity in the mesolimbic pathway #(choice A)#.  Dopamine antagonism in the nigrostriatal and tuberoinfundibular pathways accounts for some of the common side effects of antipsychotics. $ #(Choices B and E)#  The nigrostriatal pathway extends from the substantia nigra to the basal ganglia and is involved in the coordination of movement.  Decreased dopamine activity in the nigrostriatal pathway causes the extrapyramidal side effects of antipsychotics (eg, acute dystonic reactions, akathisia, drug-induced parkinsonism).  Increased dopamine activity in the nigrostriatal pathway is thought to be involved in some movement disorders such as chorea and tics. $ #(Choices C and F)#  The tuberoinfundibular dopamine pathway projects from the hypothalamus to the pituitary gland.

Neuropathologic features often overlap with other neurodegenerative conditions and may include: $ •  #Aggregations of phosphorylated tau protein:#  Tau is a protein associated with neuronal microtubules, and it normally takes part in microtubule stabilization.  In patients with FTD, tau becomes hyperphosphorylated and disassociates from the microtubules, which may lead to instability and disrupted axonal transport.  Phosphorylated tau aggregates to form inclusions that can appear as @neurofibrillary tangles@ (similar to those seen in Alzheimer disease) or round inclusions (ie, Pick bodies). $ • #Abnormal TDP-43 protein inclusions:#  TDP-43 is a protein involved in DNA repair and transcription, and it becomes abnormally ubiquitinated in FTD.  Pathologic TDP-43 is also found in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. $ (Choice B)  Cytoplasm inclusions with alpha synuclein are characteristic of dementia with Lewy bodies, which is characterized by visual hallucinations, parkinsonism, cognitive fluctuations, and REM sleep behavior disorder. $ (Choice C)  Cytosolic vacuolation of neurons and glia with prion inclusions are seen in patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a prion disease.  Although behavioral changes are common, dementia is rapidly progressive and associated with myoclonus and/or seizures. $ #(Choices D and E)#  Presenilin is a component of the gamma-secretase complex, which is involved in cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP).  Abnormal cleavage of APP leads to increased beta amyloid deposition that is commonly seen in patients with Alzheimer dementia.  Alzheimer dementia commonly presents with early and prominent memory impairment with language deficits and spatial disorientation.  Although personality changes can occur, they typically present later in the disease process. $ Educational objective Frontotemporal dementia presents with early personality change, executive dysfunction, compulsivity, and hyperorality.

Treatment options for #bipolar maintenance# include the mood stabilizers #lithium#, #valproate#, and #lamotrigine# or second-generation antipsychotics (eg, #quetiapine#, #risperidone#).  Maintenance treatment with lithium has also been shown to reduce the risk of suicidal ideation, making it a good choice for this patient. $ #(Choices A, D, and G)#  Bupropion (a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor), duloxetine (a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor), and sertraline (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) are antidepressants that would be appropriate in unipolar major depression or as an adjunct in bipolar depression if symptoms persist despite an adequate dose of a mood stabilizer.  Antidepressant monotherapy should be avoided in patients with bipolar disorder due to the risk of inducing mania. $(Choice B)  Clozapine is a second-generation antipsychotic that is used in treatment-resistant cases of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder but is not a first-line treatment because of the risk of life-threatening agranulocytosis. $ (Choice C)  Benzodiazepines (eg, diazepam) are not indicated for bipolar maintenance treatment and are associated with the risk of abuse and dependence. $ (Choice E)  Haloperidol is a first-generation antipsychotic that may be used to treat acute mania.  However, it is not used for long-term bipolar maintenance due to its adverse effect profile (eg, dyskinesia). $ Educational objective The goal of bipolar maintenance treatment is to delay or prevent recurrent manic and depressive episodes.  Lithium is first-line treatment and has the added benefit of reducing the risk of suicide."

Adolescence involves the developmental tasks of separating from the family, developing a sense of identity, and adjusting to the hormonal and physical changes of puberty.  This girl's reluctance to remove her tank top for the physical examination is likely related to her self-consciousness regarding pubertal development. $ Although differentiating normal adolescent behavior from early signs of psychiatric disorders can be difficult, this patient's engagement with school and friends is reassuring.  In contrast, adolescents exhibiting persistent anger, sadness, impulsivity, sleep or appetite disturbance, declining academic performance, and social isolation from peers warrant further evaluation. $ (Choice A)  Patients with body dysmorphic disorder are excessively preoccupied with perceived defects in their physical appearance and engage in time-consuming, repetitive behaviors (eg, mirror checking, excessive grooming) that cause significant impairment in functioning.  This patient's appearance concerns and self-consciousness about her changing body are typical of early adolescence. $ (Choice B)  Although this girl exhibits mood lability that can be seen in borderline personality disorder, she lacks the pervasive pattern of instability in interpersonal relationships and self-image, marked impulsivity, and self-injury that characterize the disorder.  Personality disorders are not diagnosed in adolescence, as the personality is still forming. $ (Choice C)  Cyclothymic disorder is a chronic, fluctuating mood disturbance involving numerous periods of hypomanic and depressive symptoms that are insufficient to meet the criteria for hypomanic or major depressive episodes.  Symptoms must be present for at least a year in children and adolescents and cause significant distress and impairment; this is not the case in this patient. $ (Choice D)  Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, a new diagnosis in DSM-5, is characterized by persistent irritability and frequent, developmentally inappropriate temper outbursts.  This patient's transient emotional outburst related to insecurity about social acceptance is consistent with normal adolescent development. $ (Choice F)  This patient does not exhibit the argumentative, defiant, and vindictive behavior required for the diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder. $ Educational objective Adolescence often involves some degree of moodiness, intense self-consciousness, and transient emotional outbursts.  Assessment of severity, persistence, and degree of social and academic impairment can help differentiate normal adolescent behavior from behavioral changes requiring further evaluation."

Although this patient has chronic anxiety, it is specifically related to her fears of having another attack and not having received a diagnosis. $ (Choice D)  In illness anxiety disorder, patients experience excessive anxiety about having or acquiring a serious illness and have few or no physical symptoms.  This patient has multiple physical symptoms, and she is concerned that they are due to a medical illness because she has not been accurately diagnosed. $ (Choice F)  Both panic disorder and somatic symptom disorder feature multiple physical symptoms and high health care use.  In somatic symptom disorder, patients experience physical symptoms persistently (eg, daily, unrelenting fatigue) whereas in panic disorder, physical symptoms are unexpected, episodic, and of short duration, typically lasting <10 minutes. $ Educational objective Panic disorder is characterized by recurrent anxiety attacks associated with prominent somatic symptoms.  Abrupt onset of characteristic physical symptoms that resolve within minutes and a negative medical workup should raise suspicion for panic disorder."

The condition develops abruptly within hours to days after receiving #antipsychotic medication# and is characterized by #sudden involuntary contraction# of a major muscle group (eg, this patient's tongue protrusion and facial grimacing).  Other examples include torticollis (neck muscle contraction), oculogyric crisis (forced, sustained elevation of the eyes in an upward position), opisthotonus (arching of the back with the head thrown backward), and, rarely, laryngospasm. $ Treatment of dystonic reactions consists of medications with anticholinergic properties (eg, diphenhydramine, benztropine), which alter cholinergic signaling in the striatum to decrease spontaneous movement.  In addition to acute dystonia, other types of antipsychotic-induced EPS include akathisia (inner restlessness) and drug-induced parkinsonism (tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, masked facies). $ (Choice A)  Catatonia is a motor disturbance seen in severe psychiatric or medical illness characterized by inability to move normally and resulting in either marked reduction in movements (eg, immobility, stupor) or marked agitation (stereotypy, hyperkinetic limb movements).  The sudden onset of a spasm in a specific muscle group is more consistent with a dystonic reaction. $ (Choice B)  Conversion disorder (functional neurologic symptom disorder) is characterized by neurologic symptoms (eg, weakness, abnormal movements, nonepileptic seizures) that are inconsistent with known neurologic disease.  It would not be diagnosed in a patient whose abnormal movements are readily explained by a medication reaction. $ (Choice D)  Symptoms of opioid withdrawal include gastrointestinal distress, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, myalgias/arthralgias, and yawning.  These symptoms are not present in this patient and opioid withdrawal would not explain her tongue protrusion. $ (Choice E)  Patients with psychotic agitation may exhibit unusual movements and postures.

      "explanation_2": "#Pica# is the compulsive #consumption of nonfood substances# for ≥1 month.  The ingested substance usually has no caloric value (eg, ice), is not a culturally accepted food source, and its consumption is not appropriate to the person's developmental level.  Pica is often associated with #nutritional deficiencies#, such as iron and zinc deficiencies. $ The 3 main types of materials consumed are #earth/soil#-rich substances, #raw starch# (eg, flour), and #ice#.  Ice is the most common, but many people ingest more than one substance.  Craving ice is particularly associated with #iron-deficiency anemia#, which is common in #pregnancy# due to increased iron requirements to supply the fetus, placenta, and expansion in maternal red blood cell mass. $ (Choice A)  Patients with anorexia nervosa restrict caloric intake to maintain a low body weight (typical BMI <18.5 kg/m2).  They may demonstrate decreased food consumption, like this patient, but they do not typically consume large quantities of ice.  Anorexia nervosa should be suspected in pregnant patients with weight loss, low body weight, and distorted body image or intense fear of weight gain. $ (Choice B)  Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder is the avoidance of eating due to unpleasant sensations (eg, taste, texture, smell) associated with a particular foodstuff or fear of the consequences of eating (eg, fear of choking or vomiting).  Although this patient has reduced her food consumption due to indigestion, she does not fear or avoid particular foods. $ (Choice C)  Bulimia nervosa involves episodes of binge eating followed by behaviors to compensate for weight gain (eg, vomiting, fasting, diuretic and/or laxative use), which are not seen in this patient. $ (Choice D)  Hyperemesis gravidarum is severe nausea and vomiting in pregnancy that can lead to weight loss and electrolyte imbalances.  In contrast, this patient's occasional nausea/vomiting (eg, twice weekly) is consistent with normal morning sickness. $(Choice E)  Patients with normal pregnancy cravings typically desire nutritive (ie, calorie-containing) foods, particularly those with a sweet or salty taste (eg, ice cream, pickles). $ Educational objective Pica is the compulsive consumption of a nonfood substance.  It is often associated with iron deficiency anemia, which is common during pregnancy, and other forms of nutritional deficiency (eg, zinc)."

      "explanation_2": "$Suicide is a major public health issue that is linked to approximately 1 million deaths worldwide each year.  It is the second leading cause of death, after accidents, in those aged 15-24.  Suicide risk management involves controlling modifiable factors that decrease the risk of suicide, such as decreasing stress, improving psychosocial support, treating psychiatric illness and substance abuse, managing pain, and limiting #access to firearms# or other means of self-harm.  Other risk factors are static and cannot be modified.  These include age (teenagers and the elderly), male sex, family history of suicide, and history of previous attempts. $ Individuals with access to firearms have 3 times the #risk# of #suicide completion#, as suicide by firearm is associated with a #higher fatality rate# compared to other methods.  Due to the impulsivity often associated with suicide in teenagers, limiting this patient's access to firearms is the most important next step to decrease his risk. $ (Choice B)  Treatment for this patient's depression should be offered.  However, the next step is to advise his mother to lock away her firearm, so that the risk of completed suicide is decreased while treatment takes effect. $ (Choice C)  Providing the mother with assistance could decrease the patient's burden in the long term but is not an immediate intervention. $ (Choice D)  Although alcohol use increases the risk for suicide by impairing judgment, this teenager does not acknowledge that he has an alcohol problem and may not be willing to start counseling at this time.  Removing access to weapons is a more immediate measure. $ (Choice E)  Although decreasing this patient's isolation and improving his future prospects by helping him return to school is important in the long term, limiting access to firearms is the most pressing concern. $ (Choice F)  Chronic illness involving pain is a strong risk factor for attempted suicide.  Although the patient's Lyme disease should be treated to prevent further disability, removal of access to firearms is more likely to prevent a completed suicide at this stage. $ Educational objective Access to firearms greatly increases the risk of completed suicide.  Evaluation of a patient's access to guns is a key part of suicide risk assessment.  Other interventions to reduce suicide risk include decreasing stress, increasing psychosocial support, treating psychiatric illness and substance use, and managing pain."

      "explanation_2": "$This patient's several-week history of depressed mood, loss of interest, fatigue, impaired sleep, poor concentration and appetite, and thoughts of death is consistent with #major depressive disorder#.  The major neurotransmitters involved in the pathophysiology of depression are thought to be serotonin and norepinephrine (and dopamine to a lesser extent).  Most available antidepressant medications affect serotonin or both serotonin and norepinephrine at the synapse. $ #Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors# are considered #first-line antidepressants# that work by #inhibiting# the #serotonin transporter# (SERT) protein, which is normally responsible for transporting serotonin out of the synaptic cleft back into the presynaptic neuron.  The inhibition of SERT prevents the normal reuptake of serotonin, resulting in increased availability of serotonin in the synaptic cleft. $ #(Choices A and B)# These receptor activities are the primary mechanisms of action of antipsychotics used mainly to treat schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders and to augment antidepressants in the treatment of mood disorders.  Potent antagonism of dopamine 2 receptors is the mechanism of action of first-generation antipsychotics such as haloperidol.  Second-generation antipsychotics have comparatively less affinity for D2 receptors and the additional property of serotonin 5-HT2 receptor antagonism, which underlies their lower risk of extrapyramidal side effects.  An antipsychotic would not be appropriate monotherapy for major depression without psychotic features. $ (Choice C)  Inhibition of sodium channels, resulting in stabilization of neuronal membranes, is the mechanism of action of some antiepileptic drugs (eg, carbamazepine).  These drugs also have a role as mood stabilizers in bipolar disorder but are not a primary treatment for unipolar major depression. $ (Choice E)  Inhibition of monoamine oxidase is the mechanism of action of monoamine oxidase inhibitors used in treatment-resistant depression.  These drugs are not used as first-line therapy due to their dietary restrictions and risk of serious adverse events (eg, hypertensive crisis, serotonin syndrome). $ (Choice F)  Benzodiazepines work to potentiate the effects of GABA, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, by facilitating the increased frequency of chloride channel opening in the GABA A receptor.  They have sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, and muscle relaxant properties but are not a first-line treatment for depression. $ Educational objective Most available antidepressants target the neurotransmission of serotonin or norepinephrine, or both.  Inhibition of serotonin reuptake by blocking the serotonin transporter is the primary mechanism of action of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors."

      "explanation_2": "$Ethanol use leads to a number of biochemical changes in the CNS.  It acutely potentiates the effects of GABA (the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS) at GABA-A receptors, leading to sedation. #Chronic ethanol use# causes downregulation of #GABA receptors#.  Alcohol also weakly inhibits excitatory NMDA receptors in the brain, and chronic exposure leads to upregulation of these receptors.

Behaviors of factitious disorder may include deceptive reporting of symptoms, manipulating laboratory samples, and ingesting or injecting medications or contaminants to induce illness, such as this patient deliberately infecting her skin. $ Factitious disorder may be more likely to occur in health care workers and has been associated with a desire for attention.  High health care utilization is typical of these patients who repeatedly seek out medical care to gratify psychological needs.  In factitious disorder, the #goal is to assume the patient role# and there is #no obvious external reward#.  In contrast, malingering is characterized by deception to receive an external gain (eg, financial benefits, housing, medications). $ (Choice A)  Fear of humiliation and rejection is a key feature of social anxiety disorder, a common disorder characterized by excessive social anxiety, fears of scrutiny and embarrassment, and social avoidance.  This patient seeks out attention and shows signs of intentionally falsifying illness, which are more consistent with factitious disorder. $ (Choice B)  Frantic efforts to avoid abandonment is a characteristic feature of borderline personality disorder (BPD).  Although deliberate self-harm can be seen in both BPD and factitious disorder, this patient engages in self-injurious behavior with the intention to deceive others, not to express anger and frustration in response to unstable relationships and affective reactivity, as seen in BPD. $ (Choice D)  A persistently high level of health anxiety is a core symptom of illness anxiety disorder, which can also lead to high health care utilization in these patients who repeatedly seek reassurance about a feared illness.  However, this patient does not fear illness but rather has intentionally induced her illness with the goal of assuming the patient role. $ (Choice E)  A preoccupation with an inability to function independently is a feature of dependent personality disorder.  Although both factitious disorder and dependent personality disorder are characterized by a desire to be cared for by others, patients with factitious disorder intentionally fabricate symptoms to achieve this goal. $ Educational objective Factitious disorder is characterized by the intentional falsification of symptoms or induction of illness.

Factors associated with #better treatment adherence# rates include close #peers with complementary behavioral practices#, positive family functioning, school involvement, physician empathy, and immediate benefits of treatment. $ Another factor affecting adolescent treatment adherence is that the prefrontal cortex (center of executive function) does not fully develop until the third decade of life.

  "explanation_2": "Sertraline is one of the #selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs#) frequently used as #first-line antidepressant# therapy.  Compared with older antidepressants (eg, tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs]), SSRIs have minimal activity at alpha-adrenergic, cholinergic, and histaminic receptors.  They are generally more tolerable and significantly safer in overdose.  However, SSRIs commonly cause #sexual dysfunction#, including decreased libido, decreased arousal, anorgasmia in women, and increased ejaculation latency in men.  Sexual dysfunction can occur #in more than 50% of patients# receiving SSRIs and is a frequent cause of nonadherence.  Physicians should routinely assess SSRI-treated patients for sexual dysfunction because some may be reluctant to discuss this side effect. $#(Choice A)#  Although SSRIs can prolong the QT interval slightly, they are unlikely to cause arrhythmias when used in recommended doses in patients who lack other risk factors.  Cardiac arrhythmias are a serious side effect of TCA overdose. $#(Choice B)#  This patient's hypertension is well controlled. Hypertensive crisis is not associated with SSRIs but may occur if a patient taking a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) ingests foods containing tyramine. $#(Choices C and G)#  Orthostatic hypotension and urinary hesitancy are common side effects of TCAs due to their antagonism of alpha-adrenergic and cholinergic receptors.  However, these side effects are rarely seen with SSRIs. $#(Choices D and H)#  SSRIs are associated with a slightly increased risk of seizures and weight gain, but these effects are less common than sexual dysfunction.  Seizures are more of a concern in patients taking TCAs and the norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor bupropion. $#(Choice E)#  Serotonin syndrome can occur if an SSRI is combined with another serotonergic agent, such as an MAOI, or an illicit serotonergic substance, such as MDMA.  It would be uncommon in a patient taking a single serotonergic drug at a normal dosage. $#Educational objective# Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have improved tolerability and a better side-effect profile compared with tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors but are associated with sexual dysfunction.  Physicians should routinely inquire about sexual dysfunction because it is a relatively common side effect of SSRIs that may lead to nonadherence.  "

  "explanation_2": "#Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)#, such as amitriptyline, inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin and are used in the treatment of depression.  They also #inhibit# fast #sodium channel conduction#, slowing down myocardial depolarization and potentially leading to #cardiac arrhythmias# in overdose.  #Refractory hypotension# results from decreased cardiac contractility and direct peripheral vasodilation (from peripheral alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonism).  Most deaths from #TCA overdose# are due to cardiac arrhythmias and refractory hypotension. $#Treatment# of TCA overdose involves #sodium bicarbonate# (NaHCO3) therapy.  NaHCO3 increases serum pH, promoting TCA dissociation from sodium channels, and increases extracellular sodium concentration.  These effects help overcome the sodium channel blockade induced by TCAs. $#(Choice A)#  TCAs cause antihistaminic effects by antagonizing histamine (H1) receptors.  This can cause increased sedation and appetite but is not implicated in death from TCAs. $#(Choice C)#  TCAs block the amine reuptake pumps within the synaptic cleft, which normally terminate amine transmission.  This permits a longer interaction between the neurotransmitter and the receptor, which is thought to account for TCA antidepressant properties.  However, synaptic norepinephrine accumulation is not the mechanism by which death occurs following TCA overdose. $#(Choice D)#  Serotonin syndrome must be considered in suspected antidepressant overdose.  Patients with serotonin syndrome have hyperthermia, autonomic instability, hyperreflexia, myoclonus, and diaphoresis.  Cardiac changes are not usually indicative of serotonin syndrome.  Although symptoms of excess serotonin may be present after TCA overdose, most deaths are due to cardiac toxicity. $#(Choice E)#  TCAs do not increase presynaptic release of dopamine.  Amphetamines increase the release of dopamine (and norepinephrine) by vesicles in presynaptic neurons. $#Educational objective# Tricyclic antidepressant overdose can cause fatal cardiac arrhythmias and refractory hypotension due to inhibition of fast sodium channels in cardiac myocytes.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient exhibits classic symptoms of a panic attack (abrupt and unexpected onset of characteristic physical symptoms and negative medical workup).  She most likely received a benzodiazepine, a medication commonly used in emergency settings because it provides rapid relief of acute anxiety. $Benzodiazepines work at the GABAA (γ-aminobutyric acid) receptor complex.  #GABA# is the #main inhibitory neurotransmitter# in the central nervous system and is synthesized from glutamate using glutamate decarboxylase.  The GABAA receptor complex consists of 5 subunits and a central chloride ion channel, with different binding sites for GABA and various drugs (eg, benzodiazepines, barbiturates).  #Benzodiazepines# act by binding to the benzodiazepine binding site, which #allosterically modulates# the #binding of GABA#, resulting in an #increased #frequency of #chloride ion channel opening#.  The influx of chloride ions into the neurons causes neuronal hyperpolarization and inhibition of the action potential.  Barbiturates act at a separate allosteric site and work by prolonging the duration of channel openings in response to GABA and, at higher doses, as GABAA receptor agonists. $#(Choice A)#  GABAB receptors mediate their actions using G proteins.  The skeletal muscle relaxant baclofen is an example of a drug that works as a GABAB receptor agonist.  Benzodiazepines work at the GABAA receptor. $#(Choice B)#  Benzodiazepines do not alter GABA metabolism.  Certain anti-epileptic medications, including valproic acid and vigabatrin, function to reduce GABA catabolism. $#(Choice D)#  Benzodiazepines do not function through direct activation of the GABAA receptor.  Instead, they work as positive allosteric modulators that promote an increased frequency of channel openings in response to GABA stimulation. $#(Choice E)#  Benzodiazepines do not function through blockage of the GABAA receptor lumen.  Examples of drugs that directly block the lumen of ion channels include amiloride (which affects epithelial sodium channels in the distal portions of the nephron) and verapamil (a calcium channel blocker). $#(Choice F)#  Prolonged benzodiazepine use has been shown to cause downregulation of GABAA receptors and may be one of the mechanisms by which benzodiazepine tolerance develops. $#Educational objective# Benzodiazepines act by binding to the benzodiazepine binding site, which allosterically modulates the binding of GABA, resulting in an increased frequency of chloride ion channel opening.

Alcohol is a CNS depressant that binds to the GABAA receptor complex, enhancing the inhibitory action of GABA (the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain).  Abrupt cessation of alcohol decreases inhibitory tone and results in CNS excitation.  Alcohol withdrawal symptoms typically start within 8-12 hours after the last drink and include #insomnia, tremulousness, anxiety#, and #autonomic hyperactivity# (variable blood pressure, diaphoresis, and tachycardia).  Alcohol withdrawal seizures can occur within 12-48 hours, and delirium tremens (disorientation, severe agitation, fever) typically begins within 48-96 hours. $Alcohol, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines have similar effects on GABA receptors and act by enhancing GABA inhibitory action.  #Benzodiazepines# (eg, lorazepam, diazepam, chlordiazepoxide) are used as #first-line therapy# for psychomotor agitation associated with alcohol withdrawal and to prevent progression to seizures and delirium.

It is no longer used as first-line treatment for alcohol withdrawal because it has a worse safety profile than benzodiazepines. $#(Choice G)#  The beta blocker propranolol can treat tremor, tachycardia, and hypertension, but it has not been shown to prevent development of seizures or delirium tremens.  Treatment with benzodiazepines is the most crucial step in the management of alcohol withdrawal. $#Educational objective# Alcohol withdrawal should be considered in hospitalized patients who develop tremulousness, agitation, and elevated pulse and blood pressure within 48 hours following admission.

This patient is currently taking the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) #citalopram# and was likely prescribed #tramadol#, an opioid analgesic that also has serotonergic activity.  Tramadol acts as a mu opioid receptor agonist and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor and, in combination with an SSRI, can potentially cause serotonin syndrome. $Onset of serotonin syndrome typically occurs within the first 24 hours after a change in dose or initiation of a serotonergic medication, and typically presents with the classic triad of #mental status changes#, #autonomic instability,# and #neuromuscular hyperactivity#.  In addition, stimulation of serotonin receptors in the gut commonly results in #gastrointestinal symptoms# (eg, diarrhea) and hyperactive bowel sounds.  Patients taking SSRIs should be cautioned about the risk of serotonin syndrome when a medication with serotonergic activity is added.  Tramadol (or other causative agent) should be discontinued promptly if serotonin syndrome occurs. $#(Choice A)#  Baclofen, a selective agonist of the GABA B receptor, works as a skeletal muscle relaxant by inhibiting reflexes at the spinal cord level.  Its common adverse effects include sedation and dizziness. $#(Choices B and D)#  Celecoxib and naproxen are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs commonly used as initial therapy for acute low back pain.  Celecoxib is a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), whereas naproxen is a nonselective inhibitor of COX-1 and COX-2.  Neither drug is associated with serotonin syndrome. $#(Choice C)#  Diazepam is a benzodiazepine that works by binding to GABA A receptors.  Benzodiazepines have sedative, anxiolytic, anticonvulsive, and muscle-relaxing properties; adverse effects include impairment of psychomotor performance, amnesia, and dependence. $#Educational objective# Coadministration of tramadol with serotonergic medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors increases the risk of serotonin syndrome, which presents with the characteristic triad of mental status changes (agitation, confusion), autonomic instability (hyperthermia, diaphoresis), and neuromuscular hyperactivity (tremor, myoclonus).

Because risperidone and other antipsychotic drugs block D2 receptor activation, there is a #loss of the normal tonic inhibition of prolactin release#, leading to #hyperprolactinemia# in some cases.  This can result in galactorrhea and breast soreness.  In addition, elevated prolactin levels inhibit release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus, resulting in central hypogonadism and #amenorrhea#. $#(Choice A)#  Nonclassic 21-hydroxylase deficiency may be associated with menstrual irregularity (most often oligomenorrhea), hirsutism, and acne in women.  Nonclassic 21-hydroxylase deficiency most often presents in childhood or adolescence. $#(Choice B)#  Asherman syndrome refers to the presence of severe intrauterine adhesions that cause amenorrhea and infertility.  It typically occurs in patients who have had multiple dilation and curettage procedures or those with chronic endometritis. $#(Choice D)#  Polycystic ovary syndrome is characterized by infertility, oligomenorrhea, and hyperandrogenism.  It typically begins in adolescence and is unlikely to develop in a 38-year-old woman.  Most patients with polycystic ovary syndrome are obese.  Insulin resistance is thought to play a central role in its pathogenesis. $#(Choice E)#  Primary ovarian insufficiency is characterized by amenorrhea, hypoestrogenism, and elevated serum gonadotropin levels in women age <40.  The decreased estrogenic effect on breast tissue can cause a decline in breast density but would not cause tenderness. $#(Choice F)#  Severe weight loss (eg, anorexia nervosa), intense exercise, and/or severe stress can cause amenorrhea by inducing functional hypothalamic amenorrhea.  However, none of these would cause breast tenderness. $#Educational objective# The secretion of prolactin is controlled by the inhibitory effect of hypothalamic dopamine.  Risperidone and other antipsychotics cause hyperprolactinemia by blocking D2 receptors on lactotrophs.

Bupropion is therefore #contraindicated# in patients with #seizure disorders# or current or prior diagnosis of #bulimia# or #anorexia nervosa#.  This patient's possible food restriction and excessive exercise suggest the possibility of an eating disorder, and the increased seizure risk with a higher dosage of bupropion would be of primary concern. $#(Choice A)#  Agranulocytosis is a side effect related to treatment with the antipsychotic clozapine.  The mood-stabilizing agents carbamazepine and valproate can also be associated with bone marrow abnormalities. $#(Choice B)#  Bupropion has minimal effects on blood pressure.  The serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine has been associated with increased blood pressure, especially at higher doses. $#(Choice D)#  Sexual dysfunction is a relatively common side effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which limits their use for many patients.  Bupropion has no effect on serotonin and does not cause sexual dysfunction.  It can be used as an adjunct to treat SSRI-related sexual dysfunction. $#(Choice E)#  Rash, including life-threatening Stevens-Johnson syndrome, rarely occurs with bupropion.  It is more commonly seen with the anticonvulsant lamotrigine, which is used to treat bipolar depression. $#(Choice F)#  Bupropion is either weight neutral or associated with mild weight loss. $#Educational objective# Bupropion is a first-line antidepressant that is not associated with sexual side effects or weight gain.

Several opioid receptor subtypes, including mu, delta, and kappa, have been identified.  Available opioid medications (eg, morphine, hydromorphone) produce therapeutic analgesic effects by binding to these receptors and modulating pain perception. $#Naloxone# is a pure #opioid receptor antagonist# devoid of any agonist properties.  Although it antagonizes opioid effects at all receptor types, it has the #greatest affinity for mu receptors# (responsible for opioid-induced cardiorespiratory depression).  Naloxone competes with opioid medications, displacing them from opioid receptors; it is therefore an ideal agent for #reversing opioid intoxication/overdose#.  Reversal effects can occur within minutes, and the duration is dose dependent (usually 1-4 hours).  Naloxone must be given parenterally because it is metabolically inactivated by the liver when administered orally. $#(Choice A)#  Medications with an affinity for 5-HT (serotonin) receptors do not have a role in the treatment of opioid overdose.  Cyproheptadine, a 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A antagonist, is an oral medication that can be used to treat serotonin syndrome.  Ondansetron is a 5-HT3 antagonist that may be administered intravenously for nausea and vomiting. $#(Choices B and E)#  Delta and kappa are also opioid receptors that modulate pain.  Although naloxone does bind to these receptors, it binds to mu opioid receptors with greatest affinity. $#(Choices C and D)#  GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain and is the target of many drugs.  Benzodiazepines and barbiturates work by binding to specific sites on GABA A receptors to facilitate inhibitory effects of GABA.  Flumazenil is a GABA A benzodiazepine receptor antagonist used to reverse benzodiazepine intoxication.  Baclofen is an agonist at the GABA B receptor that acts as a skeletal muscle relaxant.  This patient's miosis and profound respiratory depression are more indicative of opioid overdose than benzodiazepine or baclofen intoxication. $#(Choice G)#  Glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter that binds to NMDA receptors.  Ketamine, a general anesthetic, is an example of an NMDA receptor antagonist.  Naloxone does not have effects on NMDA receptors. $#Educational objective# Naloxone is a pure opioid receptor antagonist used to treat opioid intoxication or overdose.

  "explanation_2": "$The pathophysiologic basis of depression is hypothesized to involve the dysregulation of monoamine (eg, serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine) neurotransmission.  Most antidepressant medications act by various mechanisms to increase synaptic concentrations of these neurotransmitters, particularly serotonin.  Monoamine oxidase (MAO) is an enzyme located in presynaptic nerve terminals that is responsible for the breakdown of monoamine neurotransmitters.  #Phenelzine#, a #monoamine oxidase inhibitor#, works by irreversibly binding and inhibiting both types of MAO: A and B.  This results in increased presynaptic availability of monoamine neurotransmitters, thereby increasing their release into the synaptic cleft.  Because phenelzine irreversibly inhibits MAO, it may take up to 2 weeks following discontinuation of the drug before MAO is resynthesized to a level adequate for normal monoamine degradation. $Sertraline is a @selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor@ (SSRI) that specifically increases synaptic serotonin levels.  Coadministration of an SSRI and an MAO inhibitor is contraindicated due to the risk of #serotonin syndrome#, a potentially fatal condition characterized by altered mental status, neuromuscular excitation (eg, hyperreflexia, clonus), and autonomic hyperactivity (eg, hyperthermia, tachycardia, diaphoresis).  To avoid serotonin syndrome, patients must wait at least 2 weeks after MAO inhibitor discontinuation before initiating SSRI therapy, thereby allowing sufficient time for regeneration of the MAO enzyme. $#(Choice A)#  Monoamine (eg, serotonin) receptors are G protein–coupled receptors.  Internalization of activated G protein–coupled receptors plays a role in downregulating postsynaptic signal transduction when synaptic monoamine levels are chronically increased.  However, this is not the reason for the 2-week washout period from phenelzine, which is required to resynthesize the irreversibly inhibited MAO enzyme. $#(Choice B)#  Inositol monophosphatase inhibition is hypothesized to be one of the mechanisms by which lithium exerts its antidepressant and antimanic effects.  Inositol monophosphatase is not affected by MAO inhibitors. $#(Choice C)#  MAO inhibition arrests the breakdown of monoamines, thereby increasing their release into the synaptic cleft.  Overall MAO functioning gradually increases after discontinuation of irreversible MAO inhibitors (eg, tranylcypromine, phenelzine) as new MAO is synthesized. $#(Choice D)#  Increased monoamine neurotransmission due to antidepressant treatment causes downregulation of postsynaptic monoamine (eg, serotonin) receptors, decreasing their density within the synaptic cleft.  This (along with other chronic, downstream neuromodulatory changes) is responsible for the delayed clinical effects of antidepressants. $#(Choice E)#  Presynaptic monoaminergic neurons actively take up norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin through reuptake transporters and repackage them into synaptic vesicles for future neurotransmission.  Monoamine reuptake inhibitors, such as tricyclic antidepressants and SSRIs, work by blocking this reuptake. $#Educational objective# Coadministration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors can produce excessive synaptic serotonin levels secondary to decreased reuptake and decreased degradation of serotonin, potentially causing serotonin syndrome.  To avoid this risk, a 2-week washout period after discontinuing an MAO inhibitor and before initiating SSRI therapy is required to allow sufficient time for MAO regeneration.  ",

Therefore, high doses of buprenorphine carry a #lower risk of respiratory depression# compared to full agonists such as heroin #(choice C).# $A key drawback of partial agonists (eg, buprenorphine) is the potential to #displace full agonists# from the receptor: partial agonists act as relative antagonists in the presence of full agonists.

  "explanation_2": "This patient is agitated, disoriented, and tremulous with autonomic hyperactivity (eg, hypertension, tachycardia).  Development of these symptoms after a period of forced abstinence (ie, admission to the hospital) is consistent with #alcohol withdrawal#, particularly in patients with known problematic alcohol use. $Alcohol is a strong CNS depressant that binds to the GABA A receptor complex, enhancing the inhibitory action of GABA (the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain), leading to sedation.  #Chronic ethanol use# causes compensatory #downregulation of GABA A receptors #in an attempt to maintain CNS homeostasis.  In addition to its effects on GABA neurotransmission, alcohol also inhibits excitatory NMDA glutamate receptors in the brain; similar to GABA receptors, chronic exposure leads to compensatory #upregulation of NMDA receptors#. $#Abrupt cessation# of alcohol use leads to significantly #decreased GABA activity# due to the decreased number of GABA A receptors #(choice A)# and #increased glutamate activity #due to the increased number of NMDA receptors, resulting in #CNS overexcitation# and the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. $#(Choice C)#  Increased activity of alpha-2 adrenergic receptors in the CNS decreases sympathetic output and results in peripheral vasodilation, decreased heart rate, and reduced blood pressure. $#(Choice D)#  Increased activation of the opioid mu receptor occurs with opioid intoxication.  It would lead to somnolence with shallow breathing and a decreased respiratory rate.  Bradycardia, rather than tachycardia, would be expected. $#(Choice E)#  Serotonin syndrome is caused by overactivation of 5-HT receptors.  Although it also results in increased sympathetic activity, it is caused by use of serotonergic agents (eg, SSRIs) rather than alcohol use. $#Educational objective# Chronic alcohol use downregulates inhibitory GABA receptors and upregulates excitatory NMDA glutamate receptors.  Therefore, sudden cessation of alcohol leads to decreased GABA activity and increased glutamate activity, resulting in CNS overexcitation (eg, agitation, disorientation, tremulousness, autonomic hyperactivity).

  "explanation_2": "This patient initially had multiple symptoms of an #acute manic episode# (increased activity, decreased need for sleep, racing thoughts, pressured speech, grandiose and paranoid delusions) and likely received #antipsychotic medication# to target his agitation and psychosis.  His #subsequent #development of fever, confusion, abnormal vital signs, and difficulty moving 5 days later is consistent with #neuroleptic malignant syndrome# (NMS), an uncommon but life-threatening complication of dopamine antagonists. $NMS is characterized by #hyperthermia#, severe #muscular rigidity#, #altered mental status#, and #autonomic dysfunction# (eg, labile blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis).  It most commonly occurs within the first 2 weeks of initiation of therapy but can occur anytime during treatment.  NMS is thought to be primarily due to #dysregulation of dopamine#.  D2 antagonism is the mechanism of action of all first-generation and most second-generation antipsychotics.  Central dopamine receptor blockade in the hypothalamus is believed to be responsible for autonomic dysregulation and hyperthermia.  Dopamine antagonism in the nigrostriatal pathway may lead to the diffuse \"lead-pipe\" rigidity. $#(Choices A and E)#  5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition is the mechanism of action of many antidepressants (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors).  However, antidepressants are not used in the treatment of acute mania.  Serotonergic drugs can cause serotonin syndrome (SS), but not NMS.  SS has overlapping features with NMS (eg, autonomic dysregulation, mental status changes) but is characterized by neuromuscular irritability and hyperreflexia (eg, clonus) rather than generalized muscle rigidity. $#(Choice C)#  Medications that enhance the inhibitory effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (eg, benzodiazepines) are often used as adjunctive treatment in acute mania to target agitation and insomnia.  However, benzodiazepines do not cause NMS. $#(Choice D)#  Glutamate (which is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain) may be affected by some antipsychotic medications and mood stabilizers, but it is not known to have a primary role in the development of NMS. $#Educational objective# Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is characterized by severe muscular rigidity, mental status changes, autonomic dysregulation, and hyperthermia.  Dopamine antagonism, the mechanism of action of most antipsychotics, has been implicated as a primary cause of NMS.  "

Patients with this condition are frequently deficient in #thiamine#, a necessary #cofactor# for several enzymes involved in glucose metabolism, including pyruvate dehydrogenase, #alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase#, and transketolase #(choices A, B, E, F, and G)#. $The administration of glucose to thiamine-deficient patients can rapidly deplete the small amount of circulating thiamine.  This can result in neuronal injury within highly metabolic brain regions, leading to the classic triad of acute #Wernicke encephalopathy# seen in this patient: $• #Encephalopathy# (eg, confusion) $• #Oculomotor dysfunction# (eg, horizontal nystagmus) $• #Ataxia# (eg, unsteady gait) $#(Choices C and H)#  The metabolism of ethanol by alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase consumes NAD+ and increases the NADH/NAD+ ratio.  This skewed ratio inhibits enzymatic pathways requiring NAD+ (eg, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase), and as a result, the entire citric acid cycle is typically impaired in intoxicated patients.  However, this patient has the classic findings of Wernicke encephalopathy, which is caused by thiamine (not NAD+) depletion; the only thiamine-dependent enzyme in the citric acid cycle is alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. $#Educational objective# Several enzymes involved in glucose metabolism (eg, pyruvate dehydrogenase, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase) require thiamine as a cofactor.  The administration of glucose to thiamine-deficient patients (eg, chronic alcohol use) can precipitate Wernicke encephalopathy (eg, acute confusion, ophthalmoplegia, ataxia) due to rapid thiamine consumption.
