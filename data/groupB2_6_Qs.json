Pathogenesis involves genetically mediated skin barrier dysfunction (eg, filaggrin mutation) and a dysregulated immune response that favors IgE production, mast cell and eosinophil activation, and overproduction of Th2 cytokines. $Loss of epidermal water content, increased permeability to allergens/irritants, and inflammation result in dry skin, intense pruritus, erythema, and, sometimes, weeping and crusting (as seen in this patient).  Distribution typically includes the face and the flexural areas of the @elbows@ and knees in children. $First-line treatment of atopic dermatitis is topical corticosteroids.  However, due to concerns for corticosteroid-induced atrophy in areas with thin skin (eg, face, neck, axilla, groin), second-line therapy with #calcineurin inhibitors# (eg, tacrolimus, pimecrolimus) can be used instead.  Through the inhibition of calcineurin, a lymphocyte-specific phosphatase, these medications #inhibit T-cell signaling# that would normally lead to #transcription# of the proinflammatory cytokine #IL-2#.  Reduced IL-2 leads to #decreased T-cell activation# and #proliferation#, and, in turn, inflammation. $#(Choices A and C)#  Cromolyn is a mast cell stabilizer that inhibits @histamine granule release@ from mast cells and can be used to treat allergic rhinitis or systemic mastocytosis.  Omalizumab, a monoclonal anti-IgE antibody, prevents binding of IgE to mast cells and basophils and is most commonly used to treat persistent, severe asthma. $#(Choice D)#  IL-4 stimulates IgE production and the differentiation of naïve CD4 T cells to Th2 cells, which exacerbate the inflammatory response in atopic dermatitis.  Dupilumab is a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits IL-4 action by antagonizing the IL-4 receptor.  It can be considered for severe atopic dermatitis refractory to topical therapies. $#(Choice E)#  @Rituximab@ is a monoclonal antibody against the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes.  Once bound, rituximab initiates complement and cell-mediated B-cell cytotoxicity.  It is used to treat hematologic malignancies (eg, chronic lymphocytic leukemia) and rheumatologic diseases (eg, rheumatoid arthritis). $#Educational objective# Atopic dermatitis is an inflammatory condition that can be treated with calcineurin inhibitors (eg, pimecrolimus, tacrolimus) as second-line therapy after topical corticosteroids.  Calcineurin inhibitors work by inhibiting T-cell signaling needed to transcribe the proinflammatory cytokine IL-2, thereby decreasing inflammation.

In patients with OCA, lack of this pigment results in the characteristic @white hair and skin@ and #translucent, light-colored irides#.  @Iris transillumination@ occurs due to the reflection of light off the retina, causing the iris to appear red.  Because the translucent irides allow in excess light, patients often have photophobia (light sensitivity). $In addition to pigmentation, melanin plays a role in guiding embryologic development of ocular structures.

Characteristic features include erythematous papules confined within the diaper area.  In contrast to @candidal diaper dermatitis@, another common diaper rash caused by a secondary yeast infection, irritant contact diaper dermatitis does not have skinfold involvement or satellite lesions (ie, discrete lesions beyond the borders of the main rash). $Irritant contact diaper dermatitis is predominantly caused by #skin barrier breakdown# from exposure to urine and stool trapped within the diaper.  Patients with frequent stooling (eg, diarrhea) are at increased risk because urease produced by #fecal bacteria# causes an #increase in local skin pH#, which allows for activation of proteolytic enzymes that disrupt the stratum corneum.  Areas of macerated skin are then prone to frictional damage from the diaper, which further exacerbates the rash. $The #treatment# for irritant contact diaper dermatitis is a thick #barrier ointment# (eg, petrolatum) or paste (eg, zinc oxide), which provides the skin an adherent layer of protection from contact with the stool and urine.  Other measures to reduce irritant exposure include frequent diaper changes and diaper-free periods. $#(Choice A)#  Abnormal keratin expression describes the pathogenesis of psoriasis, which manifests as erythematous, scaly plaques.  Psoriasis rarely presents in the diaper area and is usually chronic and persistent without topical corticosteroid treatment. $#(Choice C)#  Increased hapten sensitization describes allergic contact dermatitis, which is uncommon in the diaper area but can occur with an allergy to a component (eg, dye, fragrance) in diapers or wipes.  The rash is unlikely to resolve without complete removal of the offending antigen (eg, changing diaper brand), and topical corticosteroids are also required in many cases. $#(Choice D)#  Local bacterial colonization with Staphylococcus or Streptococcus leads to impetigo in the diaper area.  Honey-crusted pustules are classic, and topical antibiotics are the first-line treatment. $#(Choice E)#  Scabies is a mite infestation that causes itchy, erythematous papules.  The rash can involve the diaper area, but lesions would also be expected elsewhere (eg, axillae, hands, feet).  Treatment is with permethrin, and resolution would not be expected with petrolatum alone. $#Educational objective# Irritant contact diaper dermatitis is the most common diaper rash and is characterized by skin barrier breakdown as a result of exposure to fecal bacteria that causes increased local skin pH.  Treatment is with a barrier ointment that prevents skin contact with urine and stool.  ","clickable_1":"images/img1.21107.jpg"},

Fibrils form within premelanosomes, creating a scaffold that will bind and concentrate the melanin pigment within the organelles.  $2. Endosomes within the melanocyte then transport enzymes (eg, tyrosinase) to premelanosomes.  $3. @Tyrosinase@ catalyzes the first step (ie, oxidation of tyrosine to DOPA) of melanogenesis, leading to the production of black-brown eumelanin and yellow-red pheomelanin.  $4. Melanized melanosomes are transferred via dendritic branches into neighboring keratinocytes, where they are then arranged around the cell nucleus to protect the DNA. $This patient with diffuse lack of pigmentation and light sensitivity likely has #oculocutaneous albinism# (OCA), a condition characterized by impaired production or distribution of melanin, particularly eumelanin.  Isolated OCA is most often caused by autosomal recessive mutations causing #dysfunctional melanin synthesis# within melanosomes (most commonly tyrosinase or P protein [regulates melanosome pH]), resulting in low or often completely absent melanin production. $Characteristic findings of OCA include diffuse white hair and skin and light irides.  #Photophobia# is common because @translucent irides@ allow in excess light.  Because eumelanin protects against ultraviolet damage, patients with OCA are predisposed to #sunburns#, as in this boy.  Patients are also at increased risk for skin cancer, particularly squamous cell carcinoma. $#(Choice A)#  The pathogenesis of vitiligo is multifactorial but likely involves CD8+ lymphocyte–mediated melanocyte apoptosis.  @Patches of depigmentation@ are characteristic; although the patches can coalesce to cause universal depigmentation, the process is gradual, chronic, and highly unlikely by age 10. $#(Choice B)#  Formation of premelanosomes occurs normally in OCA.  Melanized melanosome numbers may be decreased, which is secondary to reduced melanin production and not the primary mechanism of pigmentation defects in OCA. $#(Choice C)#  Uptake of melanin by keratinocytes is disrupted in Chédiak-Higashi syndrome due to a defect in organelle trafficking.  Patients have OCA, but recurrent pyogenic infections and coagulopathy would also be expected in early childhood. $#(Choice E)#  Impaired differentiation of neural crest cells into melanocytes is a rare cause of scattered areas of depigmentation in piebaldism and Waardenburg syndrome.  A white forelock is characteristic but is not seen in this patient. $#Educational objective# Oculocutaneous albinism is most commonly due to mutations that cause dysfunctional melanin synthesis within melanosomes.  Patients typically have complete absence of melanin, resulting in white skin and hair, light irides, photophobia, and a propensity for sunburns.
