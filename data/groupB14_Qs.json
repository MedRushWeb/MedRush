Patients with #repeat cesarean deliveries# commonly have an anterior, low transverse scar; therefore, placental implantation in future pregnancies is typically anterior and low, which can result in the placenta covering the internal cervical os (ie, @placenta previa@).  Eventually, an invasive anterior placenta can separate the uterine scar and invade across the uterine wall into adjacent structures (ie, #placenta percreta#).  The structure immediately anterior to the uterus is the bladder, so patients with an #anterior# placenta percreta are at greatest risk for #bladder invasion#. $#(Choice B)#  The @broad ligament@ is a wide fold of peritoneum containing the round ligament, the uteroovarian ligament, and the fallopian tube.  Because it extends laterally from the uterus to the pelvic sidewall, it is at lower risk for invasion by an anterior placenta. $#(Choice C)#  Although placentas can implant over the internal cervical os, placental invasion of the cervix does not usually occur because the cervix is composed of dense connective tissue and is much firmer, less vascular, and less vulnerable to penetration compared to the myometrium. $#(Choice D)#  The @infundibulopelvic ligament@ (ie, suspensory ligament of the ovary), which contains the ovarian vessels, connects the ovary to the pelvic sidewall.  Because it is lateral to the uterus, it is unlikely to be affected by placental invasion. $#(Choice E)#  The @uterosacral ligament@ anchors the posterior uterus to the sacrum for pelvic support.  Because it attaches to the posterior uterus, it is unlikely to be invaded by an anterior placenta. $#(Choice F)#  The ureter travels along the lateral pelvic sidewall before diving posterior to the uterine vessels and entering the bladder.  Its path is posterior and lateral to the uterus, making placental invasion by an anterior placenta unlikely. $#Educational objective# Placenta percreta is placental invasion through the myometrium and uterine serosa and into extrauterine structures.  An anterior placenta percreta is most likely to invade structures anterior to the uterus such as the bladder. ",

Shearing of these veins, which connect veins of the scalp to the meningeal veins and dural sinuses, leads to hemorrhage in the potential space between the #periosteum# and #galea aponeurosis# (subgaleal space). $This potential space extends over the whole calvaria and into the neck.  Therefore, #massive blood accumulation# (eg, 20%-40% of neonatal blood volume) can occur.  Physical examination typically shows #diffuse, fluctuant scalp swelling# that extends #beyond suture lines# and potentially into the neck.  The swelling may shift with movement and can continue to expand over 2-3 days.  Progressive bleeding can lead to hypovolemia, shock, and death, making prompt recognition critical. $ #(Choices A, B, and C)#  Neonatal @intracranial bleeds@ are also associated with assisted deliveries.  Subarachnoid hemorrhage develops between the brain and arachnoid mater; subdural hematoma occurs between the arachnoid mater and dura mater; and epidural hematoma occurs between the dura mater and periosteum.  Symptomatic intracranial bleeds typically present with seizures or hemodynamic instability, not diffuse scalp fluctuance. $ (Choice E)  Bleeding between the skull and periosteum results in a cephalohematoma, which usually presents as a small area of swelling over the parietal or occipital bone.  Because the periosteum is fixed at suture lines (eg, sagittal, coronal), the firm, nonfluctuant swelling of a cephalohematoma does not cross suture lines and spread over the calvaria. $ Educational objective Subgaleal hemorrhage is a potentially fatal neonatal bleed that occurs during delivery when emissary veins between the dural sinuses and scalp are sheared.  The accumulation of blood between the periosteum and galea aponeurosis presents with a diffuse, progressive, fluctuant scalp and neck swelling; massive blood loss can lead to shock and death if not promptly recognized.",

  "explanation_2": "$This patient with a placenta adherent to the uterine wall likely had #placenta accreta#, the abnormal attachment of placental villi directly to the uterine myometrium rather than to the endometrial decidua basalis. $The uterus normally consists of 3 distinct layers: serosa, myometrium, and endometrium.  The endometrium is subdivided into the stratum functionalis and stratum basalis.  In early pregnancy, progesterone stimulates decidualization of the stratum basalis, forming the endometrial decidua basalis. $Normally, fetal trophoblasts that form the placental villi attach to the endometrial decidua basalis.  However, patients with prior uterine surgery (eg, #cesarean delivery#) can have #endometrial scarring# or defects that impair normal decidualization.

Attempts to remove the placenta typically lead to #postpartum hemorrhage# due to the disruption of highly vascular adhesions between the uterus and placenta. $#(Choice A)#  Abnormal placental trophoblast proliferation is seen in gestational trophoblastic disease (eg, complete hydatidiform mole), which typically presents with vaginal bleeding and uterine enlargement.

This condition most often develops because the endometrial decidua basalis is absent or defective due to previous uterine scarring (eg, prior cesarean delivery).

In pregnant women with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, the fetus is subjected to high blood glucose levels because glucose freely crosses the placenta.  The resulting #fetal hyperglycemia# leads to a compensatory #pancreatic beta cell hyperplasia# and subsequent increase in fetal insulin production (eg, hyperinsulinemia). $The resultant #fetal hyperinsulinemia# causes the following neonatal complications: $• #Hypoglycemia#:  After delivery, the fetus is no longer exposed to high glucose levels; however, due to beta cell hyperplasia, the neonate continues to secrete high levels of insulin, resulting in symptomatic low glucose levels (eg, jitteriness, irritability) $• #Polycythemia#:  Increased fetal metabolism and increased fetal oxygen demand, resulting in hypoxemia and a compensatory rise in fetal erythropoietin (ie, polycythemia) $• #Macrosomia#:  Increased central adipose deposition (abdominal and interscapular), leading to increased delivery complications (eg, shoulder dystocia, cesarean delivery) $#(Choice B)#  Maternal insulin is not transferred to the fetus but instead is catabolized by the placenta; therefore, even with increasing maternal insulin use, the neonate is not affected because of placental metabolism. $#(Choice C)#  Cortisol deficiency in the newborn period is likely due to primary adrenal insufficiency, which would present with hypotension and electrolyte abnormalities in addition to hypoglycemia. $#(Choice D)#  Glycogen storage diseases are caused by enzymatic defects that impair glycogenolysis and typically present with hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis.  However, they are not evident immediately after birth because the neonates have frequent glucose resupply (from frequent breastfeeding) and, therefore, do not depend on the breakdown of glycogen. $#(Choice E)#  Fetal hyperglycemia can result in increased secretion (not impaired production) of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2), causing macrosomia. $#(Choice F)#  Insulin promotes glucose storage in the liver as glycogen; therefore, infants of mothers with poorly controlled diabetes have increased glycogen stores.  However, despite hypoglycemia, these infants have poor mobilization of glycogen (glycogenolysis) due to islet hyperplasia and the resultant hyperinsulinemia. $#Educational objective# Neonates born to mothers with poorly controlled diabetes during pregnancy are exposed to high maternal glucose levels in utero, resulting in beta cell hyperplasia followed by excessive fetal insulin production.

The disease range is defined by depth of placental invasion: placenta accreta (attachment to the myometrium), placenta increta (invasion into the myometrium), and placenta percreta (invasion through the myometrium and serosa). $Placenta accreta disorders occur due to placental invasion through #defects in the decidua basalis# of the endometrium, which are commonly caused by uterine scarring from prior uterine surgery (eg, #cesarean delivery#, dilation and curettage).  The absence of an intact decidual layer and subsequent direct placental attachment to the myometrium makes for a difficult placental delivery.  Usually, manual placental extraction is attempted but yields only #small placental fragments# due to dense adhesions between the placenta and the uterus that #bleed profusely# if injured. $#(Choice A)#  @Uterine rupture@, a full-thickness myometrial disruption, can cause vaginal bleeding; however, patients typically have antepartum (not postpartum) bleeding and intense abdominal pain.  It would not cause difficulty with placental detachment. $#(Choice B)#  @Abruptio placentae@ is premature placental separation from the uterus; it can occur secondary to hypertension-induced placental vessel rupture.  Unlike placenta accreta, abruptio placentae causes antepartum bleeding and promotes, rather than delays, placental detachment. $#(Choice C)#  Uterine atony (ie, poor uterine contractility) is the most common cause of PPH and typically presents with a soft, boggy uterine fundus.  This patient's firm uterine fundus and unresponsiveness to uterotonic medications (which contract the uterus) make this diagnosis less likely. $#(Choice D)#  Intraamniotic infection can cause vaginal bleeding and an inflamed, adherent placenta.  However, the anatomic plane between the placenta and uterus remains intact and therefore does not cause placental fragmentation.  In addition, this patient has no fever or purulent amniotic fluid, making this diagnosis unlikely. $#Educational objective# Placenta accreta spectrum occurs due to placental invasion into the myometrium through defects in the decidua basalis.  This creates a morbidly adherent placenta that does not detach after fetal delivery, leading to postpartum hemorrhage.

An intrauterine device (IUD) is a long-term contraception method that is 99% effective and safe to use in women of all ages.  It should not be discontinued in this patient #(choice C).#  Because no contraception method is 100% effective, condom use as a backup method is advised. $#(Choice A)#  Bone density testing is recommended in patients on long-term glucocorticoid therapy because these drugs increase bone resorption and reduce bone formation.  Skeletal complications from isotretinoin therapy are rare. $#(Choices B and E)#  Pelvic ultrasound and serum testosterone are used to diagnose polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a major underlying cause of acne.  PCOS commonly presents with oligomenorrhea and hirsutism, which are absent in this patient.  Pelvic ultrasound often reveals ovaries with multiple small cysts.  Treatment with oral contraceptives restores menses and alleviates acne. $#(Choice D)#  Vitamin A deficiency is rare in developed countries.  Unlike vitamin A, isotretinoin is not stored in the liver and is therefore not associated with toxicities seen with high-dose vitamin A intake.  Serum retinol measurement is not indicated. $#(Choice F)#  Hypothyroidism commonly causes fatigue in addition to cold intolerance and constipation, but it does not cause acne.  In addition, serum TSH would be elevated in a patient with hypothyroidism. $#Educational objective# Isotretinoin is used to treat severe acne with significant scarring.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient with leakage of urine with coughing has #stress urinary incontinence# (SUI), a common condition during #pregnancy#.  Risk factors include increasing parity, age, BMI, and maternal weight gain, as in this patient. $Several physiologic changes in pregnancy contribute to SUI.  The gravid uterus applies pressure on the bladder and stretches the connective tissue and muscles that normally support the pelvic organs.  In addition, increased progesterone levels relax the muscles responsible for maintaining urinary continence: the external urethral sphincter and pelvic floor muscles (levator ani muscle complex).  Normally, the external urethral sphincter compresses the urethra and creates a high urethral closing pressure.  The pelvic floor muscles usually stabilize the urethra against the anterior vaginal wall and contract to decrease the @urethrovesical angle@, thereby kinking the urethra closed. $Because of #decreased urethral sphincter tone# and #pelvic floor muscle laxity#, the compression and position/angle of the urethra are compromised such that sudden #increases in intraabdominal pressure# (eg, #coughing#, sneezing) can cause the pressure within the bladder to exceed the urethral closing pressure.  This leads to intermittent leakage of urine. $#(Choices A and C)#  Bladder outlet obstruction (eg, urethral compression by uterine fibroids) and impaired detrusor contractility (eg, spinal cord injury) both lead to urinary retention.  In patients with urinary retention, urine slowly accumulates in the bladder until the intravesical pressure exceeds the urethral closing pressure, causing urine leakage.  Because urine constantly accumulates in the bladder, patients have persistent involuntary dribbling of urine (overflow incontinence) rather than intermittent leakage with cough. $#(Choice B)#  Detrusor muscle hyperactivity is the mechanism behind urgency incontinence (overactive bladder syndrome).  Patients typically have an intense urge to urinate followed by an immediate, involuntary loss of urine. $#(Choice E)#  During pregnancy, the sciatic nerve can become compressed due to increased joint laxity from circulating relaxin and changes in maternal posture (eg, spinal lordosis).  Sciatica commonly presents as lower back pain radiating down one side of the hip to the leg.  It does not cause urinary incontinence. $#(Choice F)#  During pregnancy, the gravid uterus compresses the ureters, leading to physiologic hydronephrosis and ureteral dilation.  These changes increase the risk for urinary stasis and urinary tract infection but do not cause incontinence. $#Educational objective# Stress urinary incontinence, the leakage of urine with increased intraabdominal pressure (eg, coughing), is common in pregnancy due to decreased external urethral sphincter tone and increased pelvic floor muscle laxity.

Although these conditions can cause nephritic syndrome (eg, hypertension, mild to moderate proteinuria and edema, oliguria), red blood cells and casts would be expected on urinalysis. $#(Choice C)#  Inflammation of the renal interstitium (eg, acute interstitial nephritis) can cause oliguria but is typically drug related (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, beta-lactam antibiotics) and associated with rash and fever, which are not seen in this patient. $#(Choice D)#  A stone within the renal calyx (eg, staghorn calculus) may decrease the urine output of the affected kidney due to obstruction; however, overall urine output is typically preserved due to normal functioning of the contralateral kidney.  In addition, renal stones typically cause hematuria. $#Educational objective# Preeclampsia is new-onset hypertension at ≥20 weeks gestation plus proteinuria and/or signs of end-organ damage.  Preeclampsia is caused by widespread maternal endothelial cell damage due to release of antiangiogenic factors from an ischemic placenta.

When either mechanism fails, patients may have PPH and life-threatening blood loss.  Therefore, medications used to treat PPH commonly increase either uterine contractions or clot formation. $After placental delivery, prothrombotic substances in the decidua (eg, tissue factor) activate the extrinsic coagulation cascade, generating thrombin that converts fibrinogen into fibrin, forming a fibrin clot.  At the same time, the @fibrinolytic pathway@ is also activated: tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) is released by damaged endothelium and cleaves plasminogen to form plasmin, which promotes bleeding by breaking down fibrin clots into fibrin degradation products. $#Tranexamic acid# (TXA) stabilizes thrombi/clots by #inhibiting plasmin formation#; therefore, TXA is an #antifibrinolytic medication# that provides more time for the uterine myometrium to contract and constrict the placental bed blood vessels.  The use of TXA for PPH significantly decreases bleeding and is associated with improved maternal morbidity and mortality. $#(Choice A)#  Increasing vitamin K–dependent coagulation factor levels is the mechanism of action for prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), which contains factors II, IX, and X and variable amounts of factor VII.

  "explanation_2": "Hydatidiform moles are the most common types of gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD).  A #complete mole# is composed of multiple cystic, #edematous hydropic villi# and has the macroscopic appearance of a @bunch of grapes@ as a result of trophoblast proliferation.  Microscopy would reveal @large, edematous villi@ with decreased blood vessels, proliferation of the villous trophoblastic lining, and no fetal tissue.  Ultrasound confirms lack of the fetal pole and amniotic sac, along with diffuse echogenic material in the uterus (eg, @snowstorm pattern@).  Immunohistochemical stain #p57 is negative# in complete moles because of the absence of a maternal genome (the corresponding gene is paternally imprinted). $Classic clinical findings of a complete mole include first-trimester #vaginal bleeding# and an enlarged uterine size out of proportion to gestational age.  #Hyperemesis gravidarum# can occur from increased β-hCG secretion by the proliferating trophoblast.  Excessive amounts of β-hCG also stimulate ovarian growth and can cause the formation of #theca lutein cysts#.  Preeclampsia, anemia, and hyperthyroidism can also be present with complete moles. $#β-hCG# levels must be monitored after uterine evacuation due to a significant risk of #malignant transformation#; rising or persistently elevated levels are a red flag for neoplastic conversion (eg, invasive mole, choriocarcinoma). $#(Choice A)#  An elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level in a pregnant woman may suggest a fetal neural tube defect.  Other possible causes include underestimation of gestational age, twin gestation, and abdominal wall defects.  AFP is also a marker of yolk sac tumors of the ovaries and testes. $#(Choice C)#  Carcinoembryonic antigen is a marker followed in patients with colorectal carcinoma and is not elevated in GTD. $#(Choice D)#  CA-125 is an ovarian tumor marker and is not used for the evaluation of GTD.  This patient's ovarian cysts are likely theca lutein cysts. $#(Choice E)#  Vaginal cytology can be used to diagnose sarcoma botryoides (ie, embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma), which can occur in young girls (usually age <5 years).  It has a jelly-like cystic appearance (ie, bunch of grapes) and arises from the bladder or vaginal mucosa.  This patient's pathology is from the trophoblastic tissue in the uterus. $#Educational objective# A complete hydatidiform mole is composed of multiple cystic edematous hydropic villi resulting from trophoblast proliferation.  Serial measurements of β-hCG should be performed following evacuation of a hydatidiform mole.  Persistently elevated or rising levels may signify the development of an invasive mole or choriocarcinoma.  ",

Ventilation is increased primarily via #increased tidal volume#, which is facilitated by increased diaphragmatic excursion and hormone-induced laxity of the intercostal muscles that allows for enlargement of the thoracic cavity (although the expanding uterus displaces the resting position of the diaphragm upward, diaphragmatic excursion is not impaired).  A slight increase in respiratory rate also contributes. $The hyperventilation of pregnancy creates an expected #respiratory alkalosis# (ie, pH >7.45 and partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood [PaCO2] <40 mm Hg) with metabolic compensation (#increased renal bicarbonate# [HCO3−] #excretion#).

These changes help facilitate the transport of acidic wastes from, and the transport of oxygen to, the developing fetus. $#(Choice A)#  Low pH (<7.35) with elevated PaCO2 (>40 mm Hg) indicates respiratory acidosis.  Urine HCO3− is low as the kidneys increase HCO3− reabsorption for metabolic compensation. $#(Choice B)#  Low pH is not explained by low PaCO2 (<40 mm Hg); therefore, the low PaCO2 likely represents respiratory compensation for metabolic acidosis.  Renal loss of HCO3− (ie, high urine HCO3−), as occurs with renal tubular acidosis, is a common cause of metabolic acidosis. $#(Choice D)#  High pH (>7.45) is not explained by elevated PaCO2; therefore, the elevated PaCO2 likely represents respiratory compensation for metabolic alkalosis.  Renal retention of HCO3− (ie, low urine HCO3−), as occurs with severe vomiting and diuretic overuse, commonly contributes to metabolic alkalosis. $#(Choice E)#  High pH with low PaCO2 indicates respiratory alkalosis.  Urine HCO3− may be low in the acute setting but begins to increase after several hours to provide metabolic compensation (full metabolic compensation requires approximately 72 hours).  This patient at 31 weeks gestation will have fully compensated respiratory alkalosis with increased urine HCO3− excretion. $#Educational objective# The normal physiology of pregnancy involves chronic hyperventilation caused by elevated progesterone levels stimulating an increase in central respiratory drive.

Blood can also accumulate between the placenta and uterine wall and cause an acute increase in intrauterine pressure, resulting in severe abdominal pain, uterine irritability (ie, high-frequency contractions), and a #tender, firm uterus#. $In this patient, abruptio placentae is likely a complication of #preeclampsia#, a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy that causes widespread #endothelial cell damage#.  Endothelial cell dysfunction results in dysregulated vascular tone (eg, hypertension) and #increased vessel fragility#.  Preeclampsia also impairs early spiral artery development needed to supply blood to the fetus and placenta.  As a result, patients with preeclampsia have abnormally high-resistance spiral arteries that produce low placental perfusion, ischemia, and possible placental infarction, all of which increase the risk of abruptio placentae. $#(Choice A)#  The abnormal invasion of trophoblast into uterine myometrium (eg, @placenta accreta@) can cause heavy vaginal bleeding.  However, this disorder is typically diagnosed after fetal delivery when the placenta does not detach from the uterine wall, resulting in postpartum (not antepartum) hemorrhage. $#(Choice B)#  @Placenta previa@, the extension of placental tissue over the cervix, can cause antepartum bleeding.  However, placental bleeding from this location can readily exit the uterus via the cervix, so patients typically do not have severe abdominal pain or a firm, tender uterus. $#(Choice C)#  Physiologic cervical dilation (ie, spontaneous labor) can progress from light vaginal bleeding with mild abdominal pain to heavier bleeding during contractions.  Labor pain, however, is typically intermittent, and the uterus relaxes between contractions. $#(Choice E)#  @Rupture@ of the uterine myometrium and serosa can cause abdominal pain and heavy vaginal bleeding.  However, in the classic presentation, fetal parts are palpable through the maternal abdominal wall and patients do not have a firm uterus.  In addition, this patient has no risk factors (eg, prior cesarean delivery), making this diagnosis less likely. $#Educational objective# Abruptio placentae is caused by rupture of maternal vessels at the uteroplacental interface that leads to premature separation of the placenta from the myometrium.  Patients typically have painful vaginal bleeding and a tender, firm uterus.  Preeclampsia increases the risk of abruptio placentae.  ",

Its primary role during pregnancy is to promote physiologic changes to the maternal musculoskeletal system.  Relaxin causes #increased ligament elasticity#, which is of particular importance in the pubic symphysis and sacroiliac joints.  The increased laxity of these pelvic joints increases pelvic mobility, widens the pelvic outlet, and changes the angle of the ilium to the sacrum – all of which #facilitate vaginal delivery#. $Although these musculoskeletal adaptations are physiologic, in some patients (particularly those who are multiparous or obese) there is excessive or asymmetric joint laxity, which leads to joint destabilization and pain over the @pubic symphysis@ or the sacroiliac joints. $#(Choices A and C)#  During pregnancy, growth hormone secretion by the maternal pituitary gland is gradually replaced by placental growth hormone (PGH) secreted by placental syncytiotrophoblasts.  PGH directly stimulates placental development and promotes fetal growth by mobilizing maternal energy stores (eg, increasing gluconeogenesis, lipolysis). $#(Choice B)#  Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is secreted by placental syncytiotrophoblasts.

However, infection can also be asymptomatic, which likely occurred in this case. $Prevention of CRS is achieved by preventing maternal illness.  Maternal rubella infection is rare in the United States because of universal childhood vaccination with the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.

  "explanation_2": "During #normal pregnancy#, the maternal hematologic system undergoes several adaptations to accomodate the developing fetus and placenta.  These adaptations include: $• #Increased plasma volume#, which begins at approximately 6 weeks gestation and increases rapidly until term, resulting in a total plasma volume increase of 30%-50% when compared to a nonpregnant state.  Increased plasma volume helps reduce positional hypotension caused by uterine compression of the vena cava (ie, decreased venous return when patient is supine or standing) and ensures adequate circulating volume for fetal nutrient delivery and waste removal. $• #Increased maternal red blood cell mass#.  Pregnant women generate higher levels of erythropoietin, which drives the production of new red blood cells and increases red blood cell mass by 20%-30%.  This increase helps ensure adequate oxygen delivery to the fetus and placenta; it also #protects against excessive blood loss# associated with delivery (eg, postpartum hemorrhage). $Because the expansion of maternal blood plasma volume is greater than the increase in maternal red blood cell mass, pregnant women typically have a #mild reduction in hemoglobin concentration# due to dilution. $#Educational objective# Pregnant patients have marked increases in blood plasma volume (by 30%-50%) and red blood cell mass (by 20%-30%), which helps improve fetal nutrient delivery while also protecting against excessive blood loss during delivery.  Because the expansion of blood plasma volume is greater than the increase in red blood cell mass, pregnant women typically have mildly decreased hemoglobin concentrations (ie, dilutional anemia).

The formation of a high-flow, low-resistance circuit within the uterus and placenta also contributes to decreased SVR. $Decreased SVR induces mild hypotension, which along with direct stimulation by placental hormones, leads to activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.  This results in fluid retention and an #increase in plasma blood volume# of up to 40% in pregnancy #(choice D).#  This physiologic increase in plasma blood volume inevitably results in increased venous return (ie, increased cardiac preload), which together with reduced SVR (ie, decreased cardiac afterload) facilitates a #greater stroke volume# and #increased cardiac output (choices A and B)#. $Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) also decreases during pregnancy, likely via the same vasodilatory mechanisms as SVR.

Most patients compensate for this physiologic change with increased collateral blood flow primarily through the azygous vein (connecting the iliac veins to the superior vena cava), which completely bypasses the IVC and maintains venous return.  Because of significant anatomic variation of the azygous vein, some lack this robust collateral circulation.  These patients are particularly sensitive to the decrease in venous return occurring in the supine or right lateral decubitus position, a condition known as #supine hypotension syndrome# (or aortocaval compression syndrome). $A significant drop in blood pressure can develop and/or heart rate can increase when patients with supine hypotension syndrome are placed in the supine position; corresponding symptoms include pallor, sweating, nausea, and light-headedness.  In severe cases, loss of consciousness and even fetal demise can occur. $#(Choices B and E)#  Hemodilution is normal in pregnancy because of a relatively greater physiologic increase in plasma volume compared to red blood cell mass.  Hemodilution may be increased in patients who cannot tolerate oral iron but is unlikely to significantly contribute to hypotension.  True intravascular volume depletion is a common cause of hypotension, which worsens with standing and tends to improve with supine positioning (ie, orthostatic hypotension). $#(Choice C)#  Increased parasympathetic activity drives the hypotension that occurs with a vasovagal response.  Such a response is typically triggered by emotional stress or prolonged standing but not by supine positioning. $#(Choice D)#  Peripheral arterial resistance is reduced beginning in early pregnancy due to rising progesterone levels.

  "explanation_2": "$Female gametogenesis begins in utero at approximately 4 weeks gestation when primordial germ cells migrate from the yolk sac region to the developing gonadal region.  These germ cells then differentiate into @oogonia@ and multiply by mitosis before beginning meiosis I.  Now called #primary oocytes#, these cells arrest in #prophase of meiosis I# #(choice C)# and remain there until ovulation.  The chromosome pairs are arranged in a tetrad during this phase, and their proximity allows for genetic recombination.  The full complement of oocytes is developed by 5 months gestation and then degenerates during the woman's lifetime until depleted at menopause. $At puberty, ovulatory cycles begin and the female is capable of reproduction.  During each menstrual cycle, FSH stimulation followed by an LH surge causes some oocytes to resume meiosis I.  Telophase I #(choice E)# is the last phase of meiosis I and yields secondary oocytes and polar bodies.  The secondary oocyte begins meiosis II (the polar body degenerates) but halts in metaphase II.  Approximately 36 hours after LH levels begin to rise, a secondary oocyte is released from the ovarian follicle.  The secondary oocyte remains frozen in #metaphase II until fertilization occurs#, at which point it completes its division (telophase II, (#choice F)#) into a mature oocyte (ovum) and second polar body.  A normally fertilized embryo is then diploid due to genetic contribution from both the ovum and sperm pronuclei. $#(Choice A)#  Metaphase of meiosis I differs from metaphase of meiosis II and mitosis, as the spindles are not preparing to split the centromeres.  Instead, the tetrads are lined up along the metaphase plate, and during anaphase the homologs separate from each other with the centromeres intact. $#(Choice D)#  Prophase of meiosis II is unique as it does not immediately follow a period of DNA synthesis; DNA was duplicated prior to prophase of meiosis I. $#Educational objective# Primary oocytes are completely developed in female fetuses by the fifth month of gestation, at which point they are arrested in prophase of meiosis I.  After puberty, menstrual cycle hormones stimulate the primary oocyte to resume differentiation.  Prior to fertilization, secondary oocytes are arrested in metaphase of meiosis II.  ",

Risk factors include #advanced maternal age (≥35)# and a parent with a Robertsonian translocation. $DS can be screened and diagnosed prenatally.  One common option for screening during the second trimester is the #quadruple screen# at 15-19 weeks gestation.  #Low maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and unconjugated estriol# levels are associated with DS and correlate with decreased fetal levels (possibly due to suboptimal fetal tissue function).

Amniotic bands, loose strands of amnion that constrict and disrupt developing fetal structures, can affect the abdominal wall or neural tube development in severe cases and lead to elevated AFP levels. $#(Choice C)#  Multiple gestation will cause all of the quadruple screen analytes to be abnormally high due to increased fetal tissue and placental mass associated with ≥2 fetuses. $#Educational objective# Down syndrome is the most common chromosomal anomaly.

Polyhydramnios also increases the risk of #maternal respiratory compromise# as the abdominal cavity impairs lung expansion. $Polyhydramnios can be due to decreased fetal swallowing or increased fetal urination.  Fetal anomalies associated with #impaired swallowing# include #gastrointestinal obstruction# (eg, duodenal, esophageal, or intestinal atresia) and #anencephaly# (a defect of the cranial neural tube).  Causes of #increased fetal urination# include high cardiac output due to anemia or twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome.  #Maternal diabetes# and #multiple gestations# tend to cause milder polyhydramnios compared to the aforementioned major fetal anomalies. $This patient's prenatal use of anti-epileptic therapy (eg, valproate, carbamazepine, phenytoin) is a substantial risk factor for fetal neural tube defects such as anencephaly.  Like anencephaly, spina bifida #(choice F)# is a group of neural tube defects (eg, occulta, meningocele, myelomeningocele) that can result from maternal folic acid deficiency and use of folic acid antagonists (anti-epileptic drugs, trimethoprim).  However, spina bifida occulta, the mildest form, is not associated with polyhydramnios as fetal swallowing of amniotic fluid remains normal. $#(Choice B)#  Atrial septal defects (ASDs) are one of the most common congenital heart diseases.  ASDs are usually asymptomatic in utero.  The diagnosis is usually made after birth based on wide fixed splitting of S2 on physical examination.  ASDs are not associated with polyhydramnios. $#(Choices C, D, and E)#  Renal agenesis is associated with severe oligohydramnios (too little amniotic fluid) after 16 weeks of gestation when the majority of the amniotic fluid is derived from fetal urine.  @Posterior urethral valves@ in male fetuses can also result in decreased fetal urine output and oligohydramnios.  Oligohydramnios, in turn, can lead to excessive fetal compression causing flat facies and limb deformity (ie, @Potter sequence@).  Pulmonary hypoplasia is a consequence of oligohydramnios and is not associated with polyhydramnios. $#Educational objective# Polyhydramnios (excessive accumulation of amniotic fluid) presents with increased abdominal circumference out of proportion to gestational age.  The etiology is decreased fetal swallowing or increased fetal urination.  Fetal anomalies associated with impaired swallowing include gastrointestinal obstruction (eg, duodenal, esophageal, or intestinal atresia) and anencephaly.  ",

  "explanation_2": "This newborn patient has #talipes equinovarus# (@clubfoot@), a congenital anomaly in which one or both feet are excessively plantarflexed and swung inward.  Clubfoot is a #deformation#, a type of anomaly that occurs when #abnormal mechanical forces #impinge upon an otherwise normally developing fetal structure, leading to# alterations in shape or position#.  Risk factors include any condition that #restricts fetal movement#, such as breech presentation, uterine fibroids, or multiple gestation. $Although some deformations can improve once the extrinsic constraint is no longer present (ie, after birth), prolonged/severe mechanical forces in utero may cause significant, often permanent, structural changes.  In cases of clubfoot, mechanical forces may contribute to defects in the developing bones, muscles, or tendons, resulting in a rigid abnormality (not seen in this patient with normal range of motion). $#(Choice B)#  Disruption refers to arrested development or destruction of a structure that was previously developing normally; it is often triggered by interruption of the blood supply.  For example, @amniotic bands@, which are fibrous tissues that can encircle and constrict fetal limbs, may lead to amputation of a distal extremity.  This patient's abnormal limb positioning is more indicative of deformation due to extrinsic compression rather than a disruptive insult. $#(Choice C)#  Dysplasia describes an inherent defect in tissue development due to the abnormal organization of cells.  For example, achondroplasia is characterized by defective endochondral bone formation due to a genetic mutation resulting in skeletal anomalies. $#(Choice D)#  A malformation is due to a primary defect (eg, genetic, teratogenic) in embryonic development that prevents the proper development of a structure.  For example, @spina bifida@, a malformation of the spine and spinal cord, is caused by failure of neural tube closure (in contrast to clubfoot, in which limb development proceeds normally until late gestation) $#(Choice E)#  A sequence refers to a group of anomalies that represent a cascade effect from a single defect.  For instance, @Potter sequence@ is characterized by flat facies, pulmonary hypoplasia, and limb deformities (eg, clubfoot) resulting from oligohydramnios due to a urinary tract anomaly.  However, this patient has isolated feet deformities. $#Educational objective# A deformation anomaly is caused by abnormal extrinsic forces on a developing fetus.  Talipes equinovarus (clubfoot) is an anomaly in which the foot is plantarflexed and pointed inward due to restricted in utero movement.  ",

  "explanation_2": "$By convention, gestational age is calculated from the first day of the last menstrual period, which was 7 weeks ago in this patient.  However, #ovulation# typically occurs #2 weeks after a menstrual period# (and coincides with her sexual history), marking the approximate time that fertilization (conception) occurred.  Early embryonic development is described in weeks postfertilization, and, in this patient, the embryo is estimated to be #5 weeks#. $Critical postfertilization stages include the following: $• @Implantation@:  The blastocyst implants in the uterine wall at the end of week 1 postfertilization #(choice A).# $• @Gastrulation@:  After implantation, gastrulation occurs, which is the process that establishes 3 distinct cell layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm) from which all tissues and organs are derived.  This process occurs during week 3 postfertilization #(choice B).# $• @Neurulation@:  Formation of the neural tube (precursor to the brain and spinal cord) occurs as the lateral edges of the neural plate (ie, neural folds) migrate toward the midline and fuse by the end of week 4 postfertilization.  During this process, neuroectodermal cells adjacent to the crest of the neural folds separate from the surface ectoderm to form neural crest cells. $Following neurulation and by the end of #week 5 postfertilization#, these #neural crest cells migrate to distant sites# and later develop into diverse tissues (eg, neural ganglia, melanocytes, adrenal medulla).  Based on this patient's menstrual and sexual history consistent with an embryo of 5 weeks, neural crest migration is likely occurring. $#(Choice C)#  Rapid expansion of the gastrointestinal tract with physiologic herniation of the intestinal loops occurs during the early embryonic period (typically weeks 4-8) and is likely happening in this embryo.  However, fixation of the intestines to the abdominal wall occurs after their return to the abdominal cavity (around weeks 10-12). $#(Choice E)#  Although the primary bronchial buds develop during the embryonic stage (weeks 4-5), primitive alveoli form during the saccular stage of @lung development@, beginning at approximately week 26; alveoli continue to mature throughout gestation and after birth. $#Educational objective# Early embryonic development is described in weeks postfertilization (ie, approximate time of ovulation), and major events during this time include implantation (week 1), gastrulation (week 3), and neurulation (week 4).  As neurulation occurs, neuroectodermal cells differentiate into neural crest cells, which then migrate to distant sites during week 5 postfertilization.  ",

  "explanation_2": "$This patient with vaginal bleeding, positive β-hCG, and no visible intrauterine gestational sac has a #pregnancy of unknown location#, which is concerning for an #ectopic pregnancy# (ie, embryo implantation in an extrauterine location such as the @fallopian tube@).  Early ectopic pregnancy may not be visible on ultrasound; therefore, patients require serial β-hCG measurements for diagnosis. $This patient has an #abnormally low β-hCG level# for gestational age (eg, 800 IU/mL at 6 weeks gestation) plus an #inappropriate rise in β-hCG level#.  In normal pregnancies, these levels double approximately every 48 hours; in cases of spontaneous abortion, levels typically decrease.  Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's low β-hCG level is ectopic pregnancy.  Risk factors include pelvic inflammatory disease and prior pelvic surgery. $Despite its extrauterine location, an ectopic pregnancy changes the #uterine endometrium# due to the secretion of β-hCG, which signals the ovarian corpus luteum to continue progesterone production.  Progesterone promotes endometrial remodeling and #decidualization#, which normally optimizes the intrauterine environment for pregnancy.  Therefore, if uterine curettage is performed on this patient, it would likely show dilated, #coiled endometrial glands# and vascularized, #edematous stroma# (ie, decidualization) but no products of conception (eg, villi). $#(Choice A)#  Atypical endometrial cells with disorganized glands and multiple mitoses are consistent with @endometrial adenocarcinoma@, a uterine malignancy that usually presents with vaginal bleeding.  However, it typically affects postmenopausal women and is not associated with positive β-hCG levels. $#(Choice C)#  Inflammatory infiltration of endometrial glands suggests @endometritis@, an infection of the uterine decidua.  Endometritis is not associated with abnormal β-hCG levels. $#(Choice D)#  Straight, short endometrial glands with compact stroma are found in the early @proliferative phase@ of the menstrual cycle (ie, 4-7 days following menses, prior to ovulation). $#Educational objective# Ectopic pregnancy should be suspected in patients with a pregnancy of unknown location (ie, no visible intrauterine gestation) and abnormally rising β-hCG levels.
