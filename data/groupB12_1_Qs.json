A classic symptom is a thin, malodorous, grayish-white vaginal discharge.  The odor becomes more prominent with the addition of potassium hydroxide (#whiff test#) to a sample due to the anaerobes that release amines.  Wet mount microscopy of the discharge and cytologic smears characteristically show @clue cells@, which are #vaginal squamous epithelial cells# covered with multiple, small, #adherent G vaginalis# organisms.

Pseudohyphae of this diploid fungus are seen on potassium hydroxide preparations of the vaginal discharge. $#(Choices C and D)#  Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis are transmitted sexually, commonly together.  These organisms can cause cervicitis, which typically presents with a mucopurulent cervical discharge.  Microscopy of @N gonorrhoeae@shows gram-negative intracellular diplococci, and C trachomatis microscopy is typically normal or shows leukocytes. $#(Choice E)#  @Trichomonas vaginalis@ is a flagellated protozoan that causes trichomoniasis, which is associated with a yellow-green, frothy discharge.  Motile, flagellated trophozoites are seen on wet mount microscopy. $#(Choice F)#  Human papillomavirus is a naked DNA virus that can cause condylomata acuminata and cervical cancer.  Condylomata are commonly caused by strains 6 and 11, and oncogenic strains include types 16 and 18.  Human papillomavirus infections do not typically cause vaginal discharge. $#Educational objective# Bacterial vaginosis is associated with a grayish-white, malodorous vaginal discharge due to an overgrowth of Gardnerella vaginalis, a facultative anaerobic, gram-variable rod.

Patients typically develop a characteristic @genital rash@ consisting of #small, grouped vesicles# that progress into ulcers with crusting; the lesions may be pruritic and associated with painful inguinal lymphadenopathy. $Genital herpes is caused by #herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 or 2#; patients exposed to one serotype can acquire the other.  HSV can lie dormant in the sacral dorsal root ganglia and then reactivate; as a result, patients develop #recurrent genital lesions#.  Recurrence is more common with HSV-2, and tends to be localized (no systemic symptoms) or asymptomatic (thereby increasing the risk for inadvertent transmission).  Barrier contraception use decreases transmission. $#(Choice A)#  Fluctuant lymphadenitis (pus-filled inguinal buboes) can occur 1-2 weeks after Haemophilus ducreyi infection (ie, chancroid).  Chancroid presents with multiple, painful genital ulcers and painful lymphadenopathy, but the lesions are typically deep with a gray exudate.  Systemic symptoms are uncommon. $#(Choice B)#  Untreated syphilis (Treponema pallidum infection) can infect the dorsal roots of the spinal column and lead to tertiary neurosyphilis, which may be characterized by tabes dorsales (locomotor ataxia) and general paresis.  Unlike primary genital herpes, primary syphilis typically presents with a painless genital ulcer with a clean base (@chancre@). $#(Choice C)#  Varicella-zoster virus also invades the dorsal root sensory ganglia, and reactivation causes herpes zoster (shingles).  One complication is postherpetic neuralgia (persistent pain after resolution of herpes zoster lesions).  Patients typically have a painful vesicular rash in a dermatomal distribution and no systemic involvement. $#(Choice E)#  Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection increases the risk of cervical and vulvar carcinoma.  Certain strains (HPV 6 and 11) can cause anogenital warts (@condylomata acuminata@), which are pink or skin-colored papules or verrucous lesions, not ulcers.  In addition, primary HPV infections do not cause fever or painful lymphadenopathy. $#Educational objective# Primary genital herpes (herpes simplex virus type 1 or 2 infection) presents as multiple, grouped vesicles on the genitals that progress to ulcers.  Primary infections can cause systemic symptoms (eg, fever, malaise) and painful inguinal lymphadenopathy.  Because HSV can invade and lie latent in the sacral dorsal root ganglia, patients are at risk for viral reactivation and recurrent genital lesions.

Women are at much greater risk than men for urinary tract infections (UTIs) because they have a shorter urethra lying in close proximity to the anus and vaginal introitus, which allows #enteric flora# (eg, Escherichia coli) to spread to the vaginal opening and subsequently #ascend through the urethra to the bladder#.  The major risk factor in otherwise healthy young women is recent #sexual intercourse#.  Although urinating after intercourse flushes bacteria from the lower urinary tract (thereby reducing UTI risk), patients may still develop a UTI. $#(Choice B)#  Hematologic infections generally enter the urinary tract through the glomeruli and cause pyelonephritis.  Although pyuria and bacteriuria are usually present, most patients are systemically ill with fever, chills, and/or fatigue.  Hematologic dissemination directly to the bladder is uncommon. $#(Choice C)#  Lymphatic spread of infection is common in skin and soft tissue infections (eg, cellulitis) and is often marked by erythematous streaks on the skin.  Lymphatic spread to the urinary tract system is uncommon. $#(Choice D)#  Although poor genital hygiene can increase the risk that bacteria spread from the anus to the vaginal introitus, the primary mechanism of acute simple cystitis is the ascending spread of bacteria through the urethra to the bladder. $#(Choice E)#  Sexually transmitted infections, particularly Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Neisseria gonorrhea, often cause dysuria in women.  However, these infections are frequently associated with vaginal discharge.  In addition, suprapubic tenderness is less common. $#Educational objective# Women are at high risk for urinary tract infections due to a shorter urethra that is close to the anus and vaginal introitus, which allows enteric pathogens to colonize the vagina and ascend to the bladder.  Acute simple cystitis is generally marked by dysuria, urinary frequency/urgency, suprapubic tenderness, and pyuria/bacteriuria on urinalysis.  "},

Ectopic pregnancies occur due to extrauterine pregnancy implantation, typically in the ampulla of the @fallopian tube@. $The most common risk factor for ectopic pregnancy is #tubal scarring#, which impedes normal migration of the fertilized embryo through the fallopian tube and into the uterus.  Tubal scarring usually occurs due to #prior upper genital tract infection# (ie, #pelvic inflammatory disease# [PID]) associated with either #Neisseria gonorrhoeae# or Chlamydia trachomatis.  Both pathogens cause cervicitis, which compromises the cervix barrier and allows vaginal bacteria to ascend into the normally sterile upper genital tract, resulting in tubal inflammation and scarring. $#(Choice A)#  Escherichia coli, an enteric bacteria, can ascend the urethra to cause a urinary tract infection.  Although E coli may be found in the vagina, it does not commonly cause PID in premenopausal women. $#(Choices B and G)#  Gardnerella vaginalis (bacterial vaginosis) and Trichomonas vaginalis (trichomoniasis) can cause vaginal discharge due to lower genital tract inflammation (ie, @vaginitis@).

Common triggers include: $• #Antibiotic use# $• High estrogen levels (eg, pregnancy, oral contraceptive pills) $• Systemic corticosteroid therapy $• Diabetes mellitus, particularly if uncontrolled $• Immunosuppression (eg, HIV) $Antibiotic use, as in this patient recently treated for a urinary tract infection, results in #decreased number of lactobacilli# and is the most common predisposing cause of Candida vaginitis.  Patients can develop vulvar, vaginal, and perianal inflammation that results in erythema; pruritus; and a thick, white, clumpy vaginal discharge.  Diagnosis is made via wet mount microscopy, which typically shows #budding yeast and pseudohyphae#. $#(Choice A)#  Decreased glycogen concentration in the vaginal epithelium is typical in postmenopausal and lactating women.  This occurs due to low estrogen levels and can result in atrophic vaginitis (eg, vaginal dryness, pruritis).  This patient's regular monthly menstrual cycles indicate adequate estrogen levels. $#(Choice C)#  Enterobial larva and egg deposition occurs with @pinworm infection@ (Enterobius vermicularis).  Although this common helminth infection causes perianal and vulvar pruritis that worsens at night, there is no association with thick, white vaginal discharge. $#(Choice D)#  Elevated (alkaline) vaginal pH (>4.5) is associated with bacterial vaginosis and Trichomonas@ vaginitis@, which cannot thrive under acidic conditions.  In contrast, C albicans readily adapts to its surrounding pH level; therefore, vaginal pH associated with Candida vaginitis is typically normal (3.8-4.5). $#(Choice E)#  Human papillomavirus can incorporate its DNA into anogenital, cervical, and vaginal epithelial cells.  As a result, patients can develop anogenital warts, dysplasia, and malignancy.  However, patients do not typically have an associated thick, white vaginal discharge. $#Educational objective# Antibiotic use alters the balance of normal vaginal flora (eg, decreases the number of gram-positive lactobacilli) and facilitates Candida overgrowth.
