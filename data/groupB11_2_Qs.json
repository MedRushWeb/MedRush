Her low thyroxine (T4), elevated TSH, and antithyroid peroxidase antibodies are further indicative of #primary hypothyroidism# from chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto) thyroiditis.  In patients with primary hypothyroidism, there is a compensatory increase in hypothalamic thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) production as thyroid hormone levels fall, stimulating increased secretion of TSH by the pituitary. $Prolactin is regulated primarily by the inhibitory effects of dopaminergic neurons from the hypothalamus.  However, lactotroph cells express TRH receptors, and TRH stimulates synthesis and release of prolactin.  The# elevated TRH levels# in the pituitary in patients with primary hypothyroidism can therefore #increase prolactin secretion# and lead to hyperprolactinemia. $In premenopausal women, hyperprolactinemia can cause #galactorrhea#.

Glucocorticoids suppress the synthesis and release of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) from the hypothalamus and also block its ACTH stimulatory effect on the anterior pituitary.  Long-term suppression leads to #atrophy# of hypothalamic CRH-releasing neurons, pituitary corticotrophic cells, and the adrenal zona reticularis (androgen- producing inner zone) and zona fasciculata (cortisol-producing middle zone). $Chronic glucocorticoid use is characterized by #low# CRH, ACTH, and cortisol levels that #cannot rise# in response to stressful situations (eg, infections, surgery) #(choice A).#  This lack of a stress response can result in #relative glucocorticoid deficiency# even when the patient's baseline glucocorticoid regimen is maintained.  Because glucocorticoids help maintain normal vascular tone (eg, by increasing norepinephrine, renin, and angiotensin vasoconstrictive activity), glucocorticoid deficiency can precipitate #hypotension/shock#.  In such cases, a higher #stress dose# is needed to compensate for the increased physiologic demands and prevent the development of adrenal crisis. $#(Choice B)#  Increased levels of CRH and ACTH with decreased cortisol suggest primary adrenal insufficiency, as may be seen in autoimmune adrenalitis or bilateral adrenal hemorrhage/infarction.  These patients will also have mineralocorticoid deficiency and are at very high risk for adrenal crisis. $#(Choice C)#  Increased CRH with decreased levels of ACTH and cortisol suggest a pituitary disorder.  ACTH is secreted by corticotroph cells of the anterior pituitary; damage to the pituitary by a tumor, infarction, or infection can cause decreased release of ACTH, which in turn leads to decreased cortisol production. $#(Choice D)#  Excessive cortisol production from an autonomous adrenal adenoma suppresses CRH and ACTH production by the hypothalamus and pituitary, respectively. $#Educational objective# Suppression of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis by glucocorticoid therapy is the most common cause of adrenal insufficiency.  In these patients, adrenal crisis can be precipitated by stressful situations (eg, infections, surgery) if the glucocorticoid dose is not increased appropriately.

IGF-1 binds to a specific receptor tyrosine kinase and stimulates cell growth and proliferation in bone, cartilage, skeletal muscle, and other soft tissues. $Gigantism occurs in children and adolescents before fusion of the epiphyseal growth plates, resulting in #rapid linear growth# along with large hands and feet, thickening of the calvarium, protrusion of the jaw (#prognathism#), excessive sweating, and oily skin.  The adult variant, @acromegaly@, has no effect on stature because the epiphyseal growth plates have already fused. $#(Choices A and B)#  Klinefelter syndrome is caused by a nondisjunction of sex chromosomes (47,XXY).

In contrast to prolactin, other pituitary hormones (ACTH, growth hormone, thyrotropin [TSH], LH, and FSH) are inhibited by hypothalamic lesions because the dominant effect of the hypothalamus on them is stimulatory.  Although abruptly discontinuing an oral glucocorticoid can cause adrenal insufficiency with a subsequent increase in ACTH, low blood pressure, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia would be expected.  In addition, adrenal insufficiency typically occurs rapidly after glucocorticoid withdrawal (not 6 months later). $#(Choice E)#  Vasopressin is produced in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus and transported to the posterior pituitary for release.  Lesions of the hypothalamus and pituitary stalk can decrease vasopressin levels.
