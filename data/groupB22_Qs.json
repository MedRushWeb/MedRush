This benign, autosomal recessive disorder causes some of the dietary fructose load to be secreted in the urine unchanged due to defective metabolism by #fructokinase#.  Fructose, similar to glucose and galactose, is a #reducing sugar# and can be detected by a #copper reduction test#, which nonspecifically detects the presence of reducing sugar.  A urine dipstick, however, uses glucose oxidase to ascertain the presence of urinary glucose and will not test positive in the presence of fructose or galactose. $#(Choice A)#  Acid α-glucosidase (or acid maltase) deficiency causes glycogen storage disease type II (Pompe disease).  Affected infants have cardiomyopathy, muscle weakness, and hypotonia. $#(Choice B)#  Aldolase B deficiency is a life-threatening disorder caused by the inability to metabolize fructose-1-phosphate (a toxic intermediate that accumulates in cells and depletes intracellular phosphate).  Patients become acutely symptomatic after ingesting fructose-containing foods and eventually develop liver failure.  Treatment includes elimination of dietary fructose. $#(Choice D)#  Galactosemia is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase deficiency.  It is characterized by neonatal jaundice, vomiting, cataract formation, hepatomegaly, and failure to thrive.  Treatment includes elimination of all milk products from the diet and feeding with soy-based infant formula. $#(Choice E)#  Lactase is a mucosal enzyme responsible for the digestion of lactose.  Acquired lactase deficiency is the most common cause of selective carbohydrate malabsorption.  Patients with lactase deficiency experience gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, bloating, diarrhea) following the ingestion of dairy products. $#Educational objective# Unlike hereditary fructose intolerance (aldolase B deficiency) and classic galactosemia (galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase deficiency), essential fructosuria (fructokinase deficiency) is a benign disorder.  Although affected patients are asymptomatic, their urine will test positive for a reducing sugar due to the presence of unmetabolized fructose.  "

Fructose is absorbed in the proximal intestine through the GLUT5 fructose transporter.

In fructokinase deficiency, #hexokinase# takes over the role of fructose metabolism, converting dietary fructose into #fructose-6-phosphate#.  Fructose-6-phosphate can be metabolized in the glycolytic pathway or converted to glucose-6-phosphate or glucose-1-phosphate, which can be used in the pentose phosphate pathway or for glycogen synthesis, respectively. $#(Choice A)#  Aldolase B plays a nonessential role in glycolysis due to the redundant function of aldolase A.  However, it is particularly important during fructose metabolism as deficiency of this enzyme leads to toxic accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate (hereditary fructose intolerance).  This life-threatening disorder presents in infancy after the introduction of fructose-containing foods. $#(Choice B)#  @Aldose reductase@ is the enzyme that converts glucose to sorbitol.  Aldose reductase has a low affinity for glucose, and normally only very small amounts of glucose are metabolized by this enzyme.  The amount of glucose metabolized by the aldose reductase pathway increases significantly in diabetes mellitus and contributes to chronic complications such as neuropathy and retinopathy. $#(Choice E)#  UDP-galactose-4-epimerase is involved in the metabolism of @galactose@; it does not play a role in fructose metabolism. $#Educational objective# Essential fructosuria is a benign disorder of fructose metabolism caused by fructokinase deficiency.  In patients with essential fructosuria, some of the dietary fructose load is converted by hexokinase to fructose-6-phosphate, which can then enter glycolysis; this pathway is not significant in normal individuals.

The proteasome recognizes ubiquitinated proteins and uses ATP energy to drive the proteins through its tubular structure, degrading them into small peptides; attachment of 4 or more ubiquitin monomers is typically required before #proteasomal degradation# can take place.  Ubiquitination plays a role in many cell functions requiring the breakdown of specific proteins, including antigen processing, muscle wasting, cell cycle regulation, and# #disposal of #misfolded proteins#. $#Impairment# of the ubiquitin-proteasome system can contribute to the development of neurodegenerative disorders (eg, Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease).  Failure to properly degrade abnormal proteins can cause #aggregation# of misfolded proteins and eventual obstruction of intracellular molecular traffic, leading to cell death.

Hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins can contribute to abnormal protein aggregation in Alzheimer disease, not Parkinson disease. $#Educational objective# Ubiquitin is a protein that undergoes attachment to other proteins, labeling them for degradation by proteasomes.

  "explanation_2": "$During @gluconeogenesis@, substances such as lactate and alanine are converted to pyruvate.  However, pyruvate cannot be converted to phosphoenolpyruvate directly as pyruvate kinase is unidirectional.  To convert pyruvate to phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate first undergoes biotin-dependent carboxylation to oxaloacetate in the mitochondria.  This reaction is catalyzed by #pyruvate carboxylase#.  The activity of pyruvate carboxylase is increased by #acetyl-CoA#.  This critical regulatory step diverts pyruvate to pyruvate dehydrogenase when acetyl-CoA levels are too low, preventing the cell from becoming energy starved.  When acetyl-CoA levels are high (as with increased beta oxidation of fatty acids during fasting), pyruvate carboxylase can operate at full capacity and convert most of the pyruvate into oxaloacetate for use in gluconeogenesis. $#(Choice B)#  Muscle converts pyruvate to alanine via transamination, which is then transported to the liver where it is converted back to pyruvate for use in gluconeogenesis.  Alanine allosterically inhibits pyruvate kinase, preventing phosphoenolpyruvate from being consumed by glycolysis during the gluconeogenic state. $#(Choice C)#  Citrate is formed within mitochondria in the first reaction of the @Krebs cycle@, and elevated levels act as an indicator of high cellular energy stores and abundant biosynthetic intermediates.  Citrate is therefore an important positive regulator of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, key enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis and gluconeogenesis, respectively. $#(Choice D)#  Regulation of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis occurs mainly through the inverse regulation of phosphofructokinase-1 and fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate.  High levels of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate activate phosphofructokinase-1 and accelerate glycolysis; low levels disinhibit fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase and promote gluconeogenesis. $#(Choice E)#  Lactate is an important source of carbon atoms for glucose synthesis during gluconeogenesis.  During anaerobic glycolysis in skeletal muscle, pyruvate is reduced to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase.  Lactate formed in the contracting muscles is released into the bloodstream and transported to the liver, where it is converted back into glucose. $#(Choice F)#  Oxaloacetate is the product of pyruvate carboxylase during gluconeogenesis.  As such, increased levels of oxaloacetate would decrease the activity of the enzyme. $#Educational objective# Acetyl-CoA stimulates gluconeogenesis by increasing the activity of pyruvate carboxylase when acetyl-CoA is abundant.  This regulatory step allows pyruvate to be shunted toward acetyl-CoA production when acetyl-CoA levels are low, preventing the cell from becoming depleted of energy.  ",

Ras proteins exist in 2 different states: an #inactive GDP-bound state# and an #active GTP-bound state#.  Ras becomes activated when a growth factor ligand binds to a #receptor tyrosine kinase# located on the cell membrane, causing autophosphorylation of the receptor.  This triggers binding of adaptor proteins that interact with Ras, promoting GDP removal and GTP binding.  Activated Ras then begins a phosphorylation cascade that results in the activation of #mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)#, which enters the nucleus to influence gene transcription. $Ras proteins have intrinsic GTPase activity that allows them to hydrolyze GTP; this mechanism prevents accumulation of active Ras (GTP-bound) in the absence of hormonal signaling.  RAS gene mutations can lead to decreased intrinsic GTPase activity; this results in a constitutively activated Ras protein that causes constant and unregulated cell proliferation.

The prognosis is generally good, and symptoms can be improved by #consuming simple sugars# before beginning physical activity. $During @glycogenolysis@, glycogen phosphorylase shortens glycogen chains by cleaving 1,4-alpha-glycosidic linkages between glucose residues, liberating glucose-1-phosphate in the process.

The membrane prevents the free diffusion of ions, and generally there is an excess of positive ions outside the cell and an excess of negative ions in the cytoplasm.  This separation of positive and negative charges across the cell membrane gives rise to an electrical potential difference that ranges from -60 to -80 mV; the typical resting membrane potential of a cell is -70 mV. $The cytoplasm of a typical cell is characterized by a low concentration of Na and high concentration of K.  The extracellular fluid is inversely rich in Na and low in K.  This difference in Na and K concentration is maintained by the Na,K-ATPase, which pumps three Na ions out of the cell for every 2 K ions allowed into the cell. $Every charged ion that the cell membrane is permeable attempts to push the resting membrane potential of the cell toward its equilibrium potential.  The resting membrane potential can therefore be viewed as a combination of the equilibrium potentials of the ions that can penetrate the cell membrane.  Each permeable ion does not contribute equally to the membrane potential; it is obvious that the resting membrane potential does not equal the average of the different equilibrium potentials.  The greater the permeability of a given ion, the greater its contribution to the resting membrane potential will be.  Ions with little permeability will contribute very little to the resting membrane potential.  In the resting cell the permeability of the membrane for K is much higher than that for Na.  Outflow of K ions through non-gated channels maintains the negative charge inside the membrane, which approaches the equilibrium potential for K.  There are, however, a small number of channels that allow the flow of Na into the cell.  This small influx of Na ions decreases the membrane potential, and for this reason the resting potential of the membrane is always less negative than the equilibrium potential for K #(choice A).# $#(Choice B)#  If the chloride equilibrium potential is -70 mV and the resting membrane potential is -70 mV, then chloride would need to be the only membrane permeable ion with no contribution from other ions.  Chloride, in reality, plays little role in the determination of the membrane potential. $#(Choice C)#  High calcium conductance would make the resting membrane potential positive, and the question stem states that the membrane potential is -70 mV. $#(Choice D)#  High potassium conductance does occur at rest and is the largest contributor to the resting membrane potential.  Chloride plays little to no role in the determination of the resting membrane potential. $#(Choice E)#  If a high potassium conductance were the only contributor to the resting membrane potential, then the membrane potential would be the same as the potassium equilibrium potential. $#Educational objective# The resting membrane potential is the difference in the electrical charges across the cell membrane under steady-state conditions.  The ions that are most permeable to the cell membrane make the largest contribution to the resting membrane potential.

  "explanation_2": "In the #well-fed state#, the abundance of ATP in hepatocytes inhibits isocitrate dehydrogenase, leading to high levels of citrate in the mitochondria.  Citrate is transferred to the cytosol via the citrate shuttle and cleaved by ATP citrate lyase to form acetyl-CoA.  High citrate levels (in addition to elevated insulin caused by high carbohydrate intake) causes upregulation of #Acetyl-CoA carboxylase#.  This cytosolic enzyme catalyzes the conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA in the rate-limiting step of de novo #fatty acid synthesis#.  Fatty acid synthase then catalyzes the condensation of malonyl-CoA with acetyl-CoA to create a 4-carbon molecule that will undergo subsequent condensation reactions to form a 16-carbon fatty acid. $#Beta-oxidation# of fatty acids takes place primarily within the #mitochondrial matrix#.  Mitochondrial membranes are impermeable to fatty acids due to their negative charge, so a specialized membrane carrier (#carnitine#) must be used to shuttle them into the matrix.  #Malonyl-CoA inhibits carnitine acyltransferase#, preventing the transfer of acyl groups into the mitochondria.  This inhibitory action functions to prevent the breakdown of newly synthesized fatty acids. $#(Choice A)#  Ketone bodies (eg, acetoacetate) are a major source of fuel for muscle, brain, and cardiac tissue that are produced during times of starvation or fasting when oxaloacetate is in short supply and acetyl-CoA is in excess. $#(Choice B)#  Carnitine is an amino acid that is essential for the transport of fatty acids through the mitochondrial membrane.  It is a necessary component of fatty acid oxidation. $#(Choice C)#  Citrate is an intermediate in the TCA cycle.  It can be exported out of the mitochondrial matrix and into the cytosol, where it is broken down into acetyl-CoA for use in de novo fatty acid synthesis. $#(Choice E)#  NADPH is a reducing molecule necessary for the synthesis of fatty acids.  In contrast, beta-oxidation of fats produces FADH2 and NADH-reducing equivalents. $#Educational objective# Cytosolic acetyl-CoA carboxylase converts acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA during the rate-limiting step of de novo fatty acid synthesis.  Malonyl-CoA also inhibits the action of mitochondrial carnitine acyltransferase, thereby inhibiting beta-oxidation of newly formed fatty acids.  "

  "explanation_2": "$This child likely has #Ehlers-Danlos syndrome#, a group of rare hereditary disorders characterized by #defective collagen synthesis#.  The condition can be caused by a #deficiency# in #procollagen peptidase#, the enzyme that cleaves terminal propeptides from procollagen in the extracellular space.  Impaired propeptide removal results in the formation of soluble collagen that does not properly crosslink.  Consequently, patients often have joint laxity, #hyperextensible skin, fragile tissue# with easy bruising, and poor wound healing. $Each collagen molecule consists of 3 polypeptide α-chains held together by hydrogen bonds, forming a triple helix.  Collagen assumes this conformation because each of the α-chains has a simple, repetitive amino acid sequence represented as (Gly-X-Y)n.  The smallest amino acid, glycine (Gly), is necessary at every third position to ensure compact coiling of the helix.  Many of the amino acids represented by X and Y are proline residues, which kink the polypeptide chain and enhance the rigidity of the helical structure due to their ring configuration. $Mature collagen is synthesized by fibroblasts, osteoblasts, and chondroblasts through the following steps:  $1. As translation begins in the cytoplasm, an amino acid signal sequence at the N-terminus of the α-chain facilitates ribosomal binding to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and passage of the growing polypeptide chain (pre-pro-α-chain) into the RER.  $2. Inside the RER, the hydrophobic signal sequence is cleaved to yield the pro-α-chain.  Proline and lysine at the Y positions of the pro-α-chain are hydroxylated to hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine, respectively #(choice D).#  Glycosylation of select hydroxylysine residues also occurs within the RER #(choice A).#  $3. The central helical region of the pro-α-chain is flanked by N- and C-terminal propeptides.  Disulfide bond formation between the C-terminal propeptide region of 3 α-chains brings the chains into an alignment favorable for assembly into a triple helix (procollagen molecule) #(choices B and E)#.  $4. Procollagen molecules are then transported through the Golgi apparatus into the extracellular space.  The N- and C-terminal propeptides are cleaved by procollagen peptidases, converting procollagen into less soluble tropocollagen.  $5. Tropocollagen monomers self-assemble into collagen fibrils.  Finally, lysyl oxidase helps create covalent crosslinks between collagen fibrils to form strong collagen fibers. $#Educational objective# Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a group of rare hereditary disorders characterized by defective collagen synthesis.  It can be caused by procollagen peptidase deficiency, which results in impaired cleavage of terminal propeptides in the extracellular space.  Patients often have joint laxity, hyperextensible skin, and tissue fragility due to the formation of soluble collagen that does not properly crosslink.  "

The condition is caused by a defect in the protein responsible for carnitine transport across the mitochondrial membrane.  Without sufficient carnitine, fatty acids cannot be transported from the cytoplasm into the mitochondria as acyl-carnitine (carnitine shuttle).  The mitochondria therefore cannot β-oxidize the fatty acids into acetyl CoA, the carbon substrate for the citric acid cycle.  As a result, cardiac and skeletal myocytes cannot generate ATP from fatty acids (leading to muscle weakness, cardiomyopathy) and the liver is unable to synthesize #ketone bodies# (manifests as hypoketotic hypoglycemia). $Hypoketotic hypoglycemia is also seen in other fatty acid oxidation disorders (eg, acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency). $#(Choice B)#  Arachidonic acid can be ingested or synthesized from phospholipids in the cell membrane.

Palmitate synthesis occurs in the cytosol and would not be affected by carnitine deficiency. $#Educational objective# Carnitine deficiency impairs fatty acid transport from the cytoplasm into mitochondria, preventing β-oxidation of fatty acids into acetyl CoA.

Subsequently, the conversion of homocysteine to cystathionine requires the enzyme cystathionine synthase, the amino acid serine, and the cofactor vitamin B6.  Cystathionine is then converted to cysteine by the enzyme cystathionase, which also requires vitamin B6 as a cofactor.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient has #inclusion cell (I-cell) disease#, an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder.  I-cell disease occurs due to defects in protein targeting, a process by which proteins are transported to their appropriate intra- or extracellular location. $Normally, posttranslational modifications (eg, folding, glycosylation, phosphorylation) function as markers that help guide proteins to their final destination.  For #lysosome-bound proteins# (ie, acid hydrolases), a Golgi body phosphotransferase enzyme catalyzes the phosphorylation of mannose residues on the proteins.  Once #tagged with mannose-6-phosphate#, these proteins traverse the Golgi network and are ultimately transported to the lysosome, where they serve as catalysts for degradation of cellular components. $In I-cell disease, a #defective phosphotransferase enzyme# results in deficient phosphorylation (ie, incorrect targeting) of mannose residues on acid hydrolases, which are then #inappropriately secreted# to the extracellular space.  This leads to lack of degradation of lysosomal cellular debris, which accumulates within the lysosome, forming the characteristic inclusion bodies.  Patients with this disorder typically have failure to thrive, respiratory tract infections, and cognitive deficits in the first year of life, along with characteristic physical features (eg, coarse facies, corneal clouding, hepatosplenomegaly). $#(Choice A)#  The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the site of protein synthesis prior to transport to the Golgi apparatus for protein modification and vesicular trafficking.  Retrograde transport from the Golgi apparatus to the ER occurs via specialized protein-coated vesicles (eg, COPI). $#(Choice B)#  Following translation in the ER, secretory proteins traverse the Golgi apparatus and are packaged into vesicles that ultimately fuse with the plasma membrane, facilitating extracellular protein secretion.  Lysosomal proteins are inappropriately transferred to the extracellular space in patients with I-cell disease. $#(Choice D)#  Most mitochondrial proteins are synthesized in the cytosol and contain specific mitochondrial targeting sequences.  Translocases detect these sequences and shuttle the proteins into and between the different mitochondrial compartments. $#(Choice E)#  Peripheral membrane proteins may be modified through a process in which a hydrophobic lipid anchor is covalently attached to the protein.  This process facilitates protein interaction with the plasma membrane. $#Educational objective# Inclusion cell disease is a lysosomal storage disorder in which a defect in protein targeting prevents the phosphorylation of mannose residues required to tag acid hydrolases for transport to lysosomes.  Without these lysosomal proteins, cellular debris cannot be degraded and therefore accumulates within lysosomes, forming inclusion bodies characteristic of the disease.  "

  "explanation_2": "$This patient's neurologic abnormalities (eg, tremors, seizures) in the setting of musty body odor and light skin/eye color are suggestive of #phenylketonuria# (PKU), an autosomal recessive disease in which patients have impaired metabolism of phenylalanine, an essential amino acid.  PKU is caused by deficiency of #phenylalanine hydroxylase#, which catalyzes the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine. $Most patients with PKU are identified via routine newborn screening (ie, via elevated phenylalanine levels) and treated with a #phenylalanine-restricted diet# starting in the neonatal period #(choice D).#  This diet is typically sufficient to prevent manifestations of disease, which are largely due to hyperphenylalaninemia.  However, tyrosine is considered an essential amino acid in patients with PKU because it cannot be synthesized from phenylalanine and is required for the production of proteins, catecholamines, and melanin.  Therefore, although tyrosine is usually available in a well-varied diet, #tyrosine supplementation# may be required if intake is insufficient. $Without treatment, hyperphenylalaninemia results in the following findings: $• #Irreversible neurologic injury#:  Excess phenylalanine is thought to affect normal neuronal development and increase oxidative stress in the brain, leading to developmental delay, intellectual disability, microcephaly, and seizures. $• #Reduced melanin# production (eg, light skin, blue eyes):  Excess levels of phenylalanine inhibit tyrosinase, an enzyme essential in the production of melanin.  Low levels of tyrosine also contribute to hypopigmentation in patients who are tyrosine deficient. $• #Musty odor#:  Excess phenylalanine metabolites cause malodorous breath, skin, and urine. $#(Choice A)#  Cysteine supplementation may be required in homocystinuria, a condition in which cystathionine synthase deficiency leads to reduced cysteine production and @homocysteine and methionine@ accumulation.  Fair complexion and seizures may be seen in infancy; other characteristic features (eg, downward lens dislocation, thrombosis) usually present later.  However, musty body odor would not be expected. $#(Choices B, C, and F)#  The branched-chain amino acids (isoleucine, leucine, valine) are elevated in maple syrup urine disease, which is due to branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase deficiency.  Buildup of branched-chain amino acids and their metabolites leads to ketonuria (urine with a sweet odor) and encephalopathy within a week of birth; management is dietary restriction of these amino acids. $#Educational objective# Untreated phenylketonuria leads to irreversible neurologic abnormalities (eg, intellectual disability, seizures), as well as reduced melanin production and a musty odor.  Pathophysiology involves impaired metabolism of phenylalanine to tyrosine, and treatment includes a phenylalanine-restricted diet that may require supplemental tyrosine.  ",

Her late presentation, normal growth, and the isolated presence of cataracts are particularly suggestive of #galactokinase (GALK) deficiency#. $After lactose is broken down to galactose and glucose, galactose is normally phosphorylated to galactose-1-phosphate by GALK.  Deficiency causes galactose buildup and this excess is converted to #galactitol#, an osmotic agent that causes #cataracts#.  Excess galactose also spills into the urine and causes it to test positive for a reducing substance. $#Serious systemic manifestations# are typically #not seen# in GALK deficiency, and @cataracts@ are frequently the only manifestation (some developmental milestones [eg, social smile] may be impacted if they occur early in life).  In contrast, galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (#GALT#) #deficiency# results in a #more serious# form of galactosemia.  This is related to the accumulation of galactose-1-phosphate, a toxic metabolite that causes hepatic and renal dysfunction; patients with GALT deficiency present early, in the neonatal period, with vomiting, lethargy, and failure to thrive. $#(Choice A)#  Patients with @aldolase B deficiency@ (hereditary fructose intolerance) cannot metabolize fructose and develop hypoglycemia, hypophosphatemia, and failure to thrive.

Examples include α1-adrenergic, M1 and M3 cholinergic, V1 (vasopressin), H1 (histamine), oxytocin, angiotensin II, TRH, and GnRH receptors.  This signal transduction pathway proceeds through the following steps:  $1. Binding of a ligand to its cell surface receptor causes the #exchange of GDP for GTP# on the α-subunit of a #Gq-protein# associated with the receptor.  The activated α-subunit undergoes a conformational change and exposes a #phospholipase C# (PLC) activating site.  $2.

Levels can also increase following cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase inhibition, as seen on exposure to sildenafil, which selectively inhibits cGMP phosphodiesterease and results in smooth muscle relaxation in blood vessels. $#(Choice D)#  Intracellular Cl- concentration increases slightly after inhibitory neurotransmitters (eg, GABA, glycine) act on the neuron to increase Cl- membrane conductance (hyperpolarization). $#(Choice E)#  The intracellular concentration of mRNA increases during cellular states of elevated protein synthesis (eg, during cell division). $#(Choice F)#  Nitric oxide (NO) is a paracrine signaling molecule with a lifetime of a few seconds.  It can freely cross cell membranes and functions as a critical component of endothelium-mediated vasodilation.  NO is synthesized from arginine and O2 by the enzyme NO-synthase. $#Educational objective# The phosphoinositol second messenger system begins with ligand-receptor binding and Gq-protein activation leading to activation of phospholipase C (PLC).  PLC then hydrolyzes phosphatidyl inositol bisphosphate and forms diacylglycerol and inositol triphosphate (IP3).  Finally, IP3 activates protein kinase C via an increase in intracellular Ca2+.  "

Regulation of protein expression occurs at multiple levels, as follows: $•  Transcriptional:  mRNA production rate is determined by the binding of transcription factors.  Genetic changes (eg, alterations in promoter sequence) and epigenetic modifications that affect chromatin openness (eg, histone methylation or acetylation) can also affect the rate of gene transcription by altering access and binding of transcription factors and RNA polymerase.  Alterations of transcription factors themselves (eg, mutations, abnormal expression) can also affect the downstream expression of their myriad gene targets.  However, transcriptional regulation results in altered mRNA levels #(choices A and B)#. $•  Posttranscriptional:  After the gene is transcribed, the pre-mRNA undergoes further processing and regulation.  Posttranscriptional control regulates the rate of mRNA decay.  Examples of posttranscriptional control include polyadenylation and RNA interference (eg, endogenous microRNAs).  The poly(A) tail protects eukaryotic mRNA from digestion by endogenous ribonucleases.  Therefore, truncation of the poly(A) tail leads to increased mRNA degradation and lower mRNA abundance #(choice C).# $•  Posttranslational:  After translation of mRNA, the polypeptide product undergoes #posttranslational modifications# (PTMs), which can affect both protein abundance and activity.

  "explanation_2": "$The extracellular matrix is a network of interstitial proteins that maintain normal tissue architecture.  #Collagen# is a major component of #connective tissue# and consists of 3 polypeptide α chains held together by #hydrogen bonds# to form a ropelike triple helix structure (tropocollagen).  #Lysyl oxidase# then forms covalent bonds between individual tropocollagen molecules, generating mature collagen fibers.  The variation in amino acid sequences in the collagen α chains gives rise to collagen diversity in different tissues.  Collagen types I, II, III, and V provide #tensile strength# in skin, bones, cartilage, tendons, and blood vessels. $#Ehlers-Danlos syndrome# (EDS) is a group of hereditary disorders involving a defect in collagen synthesis.  EDS usually manifests clinically as #hypermobile# #joints#, #overelastic# #skin#, and fragile tissue susceptible to bruising, wounds, and hemarthrosis.  Common mutations leading to EDS phenotypes include deficiencies of the lysyl hydroxylase and procollagen peptidase enzymes responsible for collagen synthesis. $#(Choice B)#  Elastin, a fibrous protein in the connective tissue, is named for the elastic properties it imparts to skin, blood vessels, and lung alveoli.  Elastin fibers can be stretched to several times their original length but will recoil when the stretching forces are withdrawn.  Elastin is synthesized from the polypeptide precursor tropoelastin. $#(Choice C)#  Fibrillin-1 is a major component of the microfibrils that form a sheath around elastin.  Microfibrils are abundantly present in blood vessels and in the suspensory ligaments of the lens.  Defects in the fibrillin-1 gene cause classic autosomal dominant Marfan syndrome. $#(Choice D)#  Hyaluronic acid is another major component of the soft tissue's extracellular matrix, including synovial fluid and skin.  Exogenous injection can be used to restore viscoelasticity to the synovial fluid in osteoarthritis; soft-tissue fillers can also be used in patients concerned about age-related volume loss (eg, nasolabial folds). $#(Choice E)#  Laminins are heterotrimeric glycoproteins that bind to type IV collagen underlying epithelial cells.  They contribute to the organization and function of the basal lamina (basement membrane). $#(Choice F)#  Proteoglycans are composed of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), which provide compressibility to tissues.  Patients with deficiencies in lysosomal enzymes cannot break down GAGs, resulting in mucopolysaccharidoses (eg, Hurler syndrome, Hunter syndrome) characterized by soft tissue and skeletal disease. $#Educational objective# Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a heritable connective tissue disease associated with abnormal collagen formation.  EDS usually manifests clinically as overflexible (hypermobile) joints, overelastic (hyperelastic) skin, and fragile tissue susceptible to bruising, wounding, and hemarthrosis.  "

  "explanation_2": "The two primary modes of cell death are necrosis (which is induced by injury) and apoptosis (which is initiated by the host organism in response to cell damage, age-related atrophy, or specific stages of embryogenesis).  Apoptosis is helpful in the elimination of cells that are no longer necessary and in the maintenance of a constant number of cells in rapidly growing tissues.  Tumor cells, for example, die by apoptosis.  The death of B and T lymphocytes and virally-infected cells also occurs through apoptosis.  The remains of cells that die by this method are phagocytized by macrophages. $The process of apoptosis involves the following steps:  $1. Initiation: Apoptosis is triggered by different stimuli and can occur through either the intrinsic, mitochondria-mediated pathway or the extrinsic, receptor-initiated pathway.  Cells damaged by ultraviolet light, heat, hypoxia, toxins, or radiation display intrinsic apoptotic signals (eg, phosphatidylserine or thrombospondin) on their plasma membranes.  Extrinsic apoptosis, in contrast, is induced by the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) when bound to tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) or the Fas ligand when bound to cell surface receptor Fas.  $2. Control: Intrinsic apoptosis is mediated by a group of bcl-2 proteins.  Some of the components of this system are pro-apoptotic (eg, Bak, Bax, and Bim proteins), while others are anti-apoptotic (eg, Bcl-x and Bcl-2 proteins).  Apoptotic signals tip the balance between these two forces, resulting in changes of the inner mitochondrial membrane.  These changes are responsible for the formation of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) and the release of cytochrome c and other pro-apoptotic proteins into the cytoplasm, which then activate caspases.  In extrinsic apoptosis, the binding of the death ligand and the death receptor allows for pro-caspase molecules to be brought into close proximity.  $3. Destruction: Both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways converge at this step, resulting in caspase activation.  Caspases are proteolytic enzymes that destroy cell components.  They contain cysteine and are able to cleave aspartic acid residues (#c#ysteine-#asp#artic-acid-prote#ases#).  The eleven caspases that have been identified are classified as either initiator or effector caspases.  Initiator caspases activate the effector caspases, which then cleave the cellular proteins. $#(Choice A)#  Metalloproteinases are zinc-containing enzymes that degrade the components of the extracellular matrix (eg, collagen, laminin, fibronectin).  Metalloproteinases are essential for proper tissue remodeling during wound healing. $#(Choice B)#  Acid hydrolases do not participate in apoptosis. $#(Choice D)#  Phospholipase A2 does not participate in apoptosis. $#(Choice E)#  Protein kinase A is a component of the cAMP-associated signaling system.  The binding of a ligand to a G-protein-linked receptor results in adenylyl cyclase activation and the release of cAMP.  Elevated levels of cAMP activate protein kinase A. $#Educational objective# Apoptosis can occur through either the intrinsic (mitochondria-mediated) pathway or the extrinsic (receptor-initiated) pathway.  Both pathways converge in the activation of caspases.  Caspases are proteolytic enzymes that cleave cellular proteins.  "

  "explanation_2": "$Alanine and glutamine play an important role in transporting nitrogen throughout the body.  Glutamine is produced by most body tissues and is catabolized primarily by the gut and kidney for maintenance of cellular metabolism and acid-base regulation, respectively.  A significant portion of the glutamine used by these tissues is converted to alanine and released into the circulation.  Alanine is also released by skeletal muscle tissue during protein catabolism as part of the @glucose-alanine cycle@ that helps remove excess nitrogen.  Alanine is then transported to the liver, where it serves as a vehicle for nitrogen disposal and as a source of carbon skeletons for gluconeogenesis. $In the liver, alanine is transaminated by alanine aminotransferase to pyruvate with the amino group being transferred to α-ketoglutarate to form glutamate.  Almost all aminotransferase enzymes use α-ketoglutarate as the amino group acceptor.  Thus, amino groups are funneled into glutamate during protein catabolism.  Glutamate is further metabolized by the enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase, which liberates free ammonia and regenerates α-ketoglutarate.  Ammonia then enters the urea cycle to form urea, the primary disposal form of nitrogen in humans.  Urea subsequently enters the blood and is excreted in the urine. $#(Choices C, D, and E)#  Malate, citrate, and oxaloacetate are all intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. $#(Choice B)#  L-citrulline is an amino acid produced as an intermediate in the conversion of ornithine to argininosuccinate during the hepatic urea cycle. $#Educational objective# Alanine is the major amino acid responsible for transferring nitrogen to the liver for disposal.

  "explanation_2": "$Ammonia generated from the metabolism of amino acids is converted into urea by the urea cycle.  The combination of bicarbonate (HCO3-), ammonia, and ATP is catalyzed by carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (rate-limiting enzyme in the urea cycle) to yield carbamoyl phosphate.  Carbamoyl phosphate combines with ornithine to form citrulline in a reaction catalyzed by ornithine transcarbamylase.  Citrulline enters the cytosol and is converted to argininosuccinate, which is then converted to arginine.  The conversion of arginine to ornithine by arginase completes the urea cycle by releasing a urea molecule.  N-acetylglutamate serves as a regulator of the urea cycle through activation of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I. $This patient most likely has #ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency#, the most common urea cycle disorder.  OTC deficiency results in excess carbamoyl phosphate, which stimulates pyrimidine synthesis.  As an intermediate product in this pathway, orotic acid accumulates and results in #increased urinary orotic acid#. $Patients also have #hyperammonemia# due to impaired ammonia excretion, which is a #metabolic emergency#.  Ammonia is neurotoxic and causes #episodes of vomiting and confusion/coma#.  #Tachypnea# also occurs due to cerebral edema from ammonia buildup, resulting in central hyperventilation and respiratory alkalosis.  Metabolic decompensation is often triggered by illness (eg, viral upper respiratory infection, acute otitis media), fasting, or increased protein intake. $#(Choices A and C)#  Although defects in carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I and N-Acetylglutamate synthetase also result in hyperammonemia, levels of carbamoyl phosphate are low and orotic acid is not elevated in the urine. $#(Choice B)#  Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency (Lesch-Nyhan syndrome) results in hyperuricemia because purines cannot be salvaged from degraded DNA.  Urate kidney stones and self-mutilation are classic clinical manifestations. $#(Choice E)#  Uridine monophosphate synthetase (UMPS) is part of the pyrimidine synthesis pathway.  UMPS deficiency leads to orotic acid buildup (similar to OTC deficiency) but not hyperammonemia.  Characteristic findings include megaloblastic anemia and delayed growth. $#Educational objective# Patients with urea cycle disorders typically have discrete episodes of vomiting, tachypnea, and confusion/coma secondary to hyperammonemia (a metabolic emergency).

This patient with #celiac disease#, who is noncompliant with dietary restrictions, likely developed folate deficiency due to inflammation in the wall of the jejunum, which impaired folate absorption. $Folate has a crucial role in the generation of purines and pyrimidines by converting homocysteine to methionine.  Specifically, 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate donates its methyl group to vitamin B12, forming methylcobalamin, then methylcobalamin donates its methyl group to homocysteine to form methionine.  In folate deficiency, homocysteine cannot be converted to methionine, leading to homocysteine accumulation #(choice C).#  In contrast, #folate supplementation# results in the rapid conversion of homocysteine to methionine, leading to #low homocysteine# and #high methionine#. $#Methylmalonic acid# is a biomarker for vitamin B12 because conversion of methylmalonyl-coenzyme A (CoA) to succinyl-CoA requires vitamin B12.

In the United States, vitamin C deficiency is seen primarily among malnourished populations, including patients with alcohol use disorder and the elderly.

Within the RER, specific #proline and lysine# residues are post-translationally #hydroxylated# to hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine by prolyl hydroxylase and lysyl hydroxylase, respectively.  #Vitamin C# is a #required cofactor# for this post-translational modification.  Defective hydroxylation of these residues severely diminishes the amount of collagen secreted by fibroblasts and impairs triple helix stability and covalent crosslink formation. $#(Choices A and B)#  After formation of the triple helix, procollagen molecules are secreted from the cell via the Golgi apparatus.  Propeptides at the N- and C-terminals are cleaved by extracellular procollagen peptidase to form insoluble tropocollagen molecules.  These monomers then self-assemble into collagen fibrils that are subsequently crosslinked via lysyl oxidase. $#(Choices C and D)#  Lysosomes and mitochondria are not directly involved in the synthesis of collagen. $#Educational objective# The hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues in collagen helps it attain its maximum tensile strength.  This process occurs in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and requires vitamin C as a cofactor.

Dietary carbohydrates are broken down into pyruvate via glycolysis; in patients with pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, the lack of enzymatic activity leads to a #buildup of pyruvate#, which is shunted to lactate via @lactate dehydrogenase@, generating a potentially life-threatening #lactic acidosis#. $Disease management involves the implementation of a #ketogenic diet#: a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet with moderate levels of protein.  This diet forces the production of ketone bodies from fat and amino acid catabolism to fuel the body in the place of glucose.  The near-absence of glucose in the diet decreases the amount of pyruvate generated, thereby decreasing lactate levels. $Amino acid catabolism results in formation of intermediates that are referred to as glucogenic, ketogenic, or both.

Galactose is then phosphorylated to galactose-1-phosphate by the enzyme galactokinase (GALK).  Galactose-1-phosphate is converted to glucose-1-phosphate by epimerization with transfer of uridine diphosphate (UDP) from UDP-glucose to UDP-galactose.  This reaction is catalyzed by #galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (GALT)#.  UDP-galactose is then epimerized to UDP-glucose by UDP-galactose-4 epimerase.  Although GALT deficiency is the most common form, a defect in any of these three enzymes can cause galactosemia. $#Galactosemia# can present with #vomiting# and lethargy soon after initiation of #breastfeeding#.  In GALT deficiency, toxicity of accumulated galactose-1-phosphate is responsible for impaired liver function (transaminitis, hyperbilirubinemia, hypoglycemia) and renal dysfunction (hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, aminoaciduria).  Patients are also predisposed to Escherichia coli (gram-negative rod) #sepsis#. $Restricting lactose intake (eg, breast milk) and initiation of soy milk-based formula can result in regression of cataracts and improvement in renal and liver function.  Soy milk consists of sucrose, which is metabolized to glucose and fructose.

GALT and GALK deficiency can lead to galactitol accumulation in the lens, which can lead to #cataract# formation in patients with galactosemia.  However, aldose reductase deficiency does not cause galactosemia. $#(Choice C)#  GALK phosphorylates galactose and its deficiency typically causes less severe manifestations of galactosemia with cataract formation (due to galactitol) being the most common manifestation.  Because galactose-1-phosphate does not accumulate, liver and renal functions are preserved. $#(Choice E)#  Phosphoglucomutase isomerizes glucose-1-phosphate to glucose-6-phosphate, which then enters the glycolytic pathway.  Its deficiency is rare.  In GALT deficiency, accumulation of galactose-1-phosphate blocks phosphoglucomutase, thereby preventing energy production via glycolysis. $#Educational objective# Classic galactosemia results from deficiency of galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase.

Within the cell, the positive charge of the K+ ions is normally neutralized by the negative charge of intracellular anions (eg, phosphates and proteins) that are trapped in the cell.  As K+ ions leave the cell, negatively charged anions accumulate along the inner side of the cell membrane.  This continually increasing negative charge attracts the positively charged K+ ions back into the cell.

  "explanation_2": "$Dietary fructose is obtained mainly from fruits, vegetables, honey, table sugar (sucrose), and processed foods.  Fructose is rapidly absorbed in the proximal small bowel by the hexose transporter GLUT 5.  Initial metabolism of fructose involves three enzymes: fructokinase, aldolase B, and triokinase.  Fructose is phosphorylated on the first carbon by hepatic fructokinase, yielding fructose-1-phosphate.  Metabolism of fructose-1-phosphate by aldolase B generates dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde.  Glyceraldehyde is then phosphorylated to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), an intermediate of glycolysis, by triose kinase.  DHAP can also be converted to G3P by triose phosphate isomerase. $Aldolase B deficiency causes the potentially life-threatening disorder known as hereditary fructose intolerance.  Patients typically present when fructose-containing foods are introduced into the diet.  The primary manifestations are vomiting and hypoglycemia about 20-30 minutes after fructose ingestion.  Hypoglycemia results from intracellular accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate and depletion of inorganic phosphate, which inhibit glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis.  Failure to thrive, hepatomegaly, and jaundice can also occur.  Undiagnosed individuals may eventually develop liver and renal failure.  Elimination of dietary fructose is the mainstay of treatment and results in symptom improvement with a good long-term prognosis. $#(Choices A and D)#  Galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase deficiency (classic galactosemia) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by vomiting, feeding intolerance, neonatal jaundice, hepatomegaly, and death if untreated.

Fructose from the diet is absorbed and secreted freely in the urine due to impairment of the first step in fructose metabolism. $#(Choice E)#  Glycogenolysis is accomplished mainly by glycogen phosphorylase and debranching enzyme, but a small amount is also broken down by the lysosomal enzyme α-1,4-glucosidase.  Alpha-glucosidase (or acid maltase) deficiency causes Pompe disease.

BH4 is converted from its unreduced form (BH2) by dihydropteridine reductase; it is an #essential cofactor# for the following hydroxylase enzymes: $• #Phenylalanine hydroxylase:#  This enzyme converts phenylalanine to tyrosine, and impaired conversion leads to hyperphenylalaninemia; impaired BH4 synthesis causes the same findings as phenylketonuria.  The excess phenylalanine causes #irreversible neurologic injury# (microcephaly, developmental delay, seizures) when untreated.  Elevated phenylalanine is also a competitive inhibitor of tyrosinase, an enzyme essential in the production of melanin; reduced melanin production explains this patient's #hypopigmentation#. $• #Tyrosine hydroxylase:#  Impaired conversion of tyrosine to L-dopa results in #reduced catecholamine production# because L-dopa is the precursor for dopamine (substantia nigra), norepinephrine (locus caeruleus), and epinephrine.  Impaired neurotransmitter production also leads to progressive neurologic findings, including extrapyramidal signs (eg, dystonia, truncal hypotonia) and autonomic dysfunction. $• #Tryptophan hydroxylase:#  Impaired conversion of tryptophan to #serotonin# results in dysregulation of mood, appetite, sleep, and muscle contraction. $#(Choice A)#  Branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase is a complex of enzymes that catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of the alpha-ketoacid derivatives of the branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, valine).  Deficiency causes maple syrup urine disease, which can affect neurotransmitter (eg, dopamine, serotonin) production and cause seizures.  Diffuse hypopigmentation would not be seen. $#(Choice B)#  Dopamine hydroxylase synthesizes norepinephrine from dopamine, and deficiency causes a rare form of dysautonomia (eg, orthostatic hypotension, hypothermia), not microcephaly or hypopigmentation. $#(Choice C)#  Homogentisic acid oxidase catalyzes a step in the degradation of tyrosine to fumarate (involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle).  Deficiency causes alkaptonuria, an autosomal recessive disease that causes homogentisic acid accumulation; findings include connective tissue hyperpigmentation, arthropathy (in adults), and urine that darkens after several hours. $#Educational objective# Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is an essential cofactor for hydroxylase enzymes involved in the metabolism of phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan.  Impaired BH4 synthesis causes hyperphenylalaninemia and reduced levels of neurotransmitters (eg, dopamine, serotonin), causing progressive neurologic findings (developmental delay, seizures, microcephaly).

  "explanation_2": "$Glucose is the major source of energy for all cells of the body.  In the majority of tissues, glucose transport occurs along its concentration gradient, from higher concentrations outside the cell toward lower concentrations inside the cell.  However, glucose cannot passively diffuse across the cell membrane in any significant amount and requires carrier proteins to aid its crossing.  Transport across the cell membrane by carrier proteins (which undergo conformational changes as the substrate is transported, unlike channel proteins) is termed carrier-mediated transport.  Transport that is facilitated by transmembrane proteins without the expenditure of energy is called #facilitated diffusion#. $Transmembrane carrier proteins that belong to the GLUT family transport glucose by facilitated diffusion.  These proteins are stereoselective and preferentially catalyze the entrance of D-glucose rather than L-glucose into cells.  #GLUT4# is the insulin-sensitive transporter found in skeletal muscle cells and adipocytes.  In these cells, the GLUT4 protein is stored in cytoplasmic vesicles.  Under the influence of insulin, the transporter protein is incorporated into the cell membrane.  An increased number of transporters in the membrane leads to an increased rate of glucose uptake by the cells.  Another important glucose transporter is #GLUT2#.  It facilitates export of glucose from the liver, small intestine, and kidneys into the circulation and also helps to control insulin secretion in the pancreas. $#(Choice A)#  Simple diffusion refers to the movement of particles along their concentration gradient directly through the cell membrane.  Transport of gases (O2 and CO2) occurs via simple diffusion, as the membrane is very permeable to small, nonpolar molecules. $#(Choice B)#  Endocytosis allows for cellular uptake through the formation of membrane-bound, typically clathrin-coated, vesicles.  Uptake of cholesterol by cells occurs by means of receptor-mediated endocytosis (mediated by the LDL receptor). $#(Choices D and E)#  Active transport refers to the movement of a substance against its concentration gradient.  This process requires energy as well as transport proteins.  In primary active transport, the energy required for transport against the concentration gradient is provided by the hydrolysis of ATP.  In secondary active transport, this energy is generated by co-transport of a separate substance down its concentration gradient.  Transport of glucose against the concentration gradient occurs via the Na/glucose symporter, which is found in the intestinal and renal tubular epithelium and is used to transfer glucose intracellularly from the lumen. $#Educational objective# Transport of glucose into the cells of most tissues occurs by means of facilitated diffusion.  Glucose moves from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration with the help of transmembrane glucose transporter proteins (GLUT).  These carrier proteins are stereoselective and have preference for D-glucose.  "
