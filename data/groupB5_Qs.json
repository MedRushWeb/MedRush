    "explanation_2": "$Bleeding peptic ulcer disease should be considered in patients who develop acute epigastric pain, unstable vital signs, or hematemesis, particularly in the setting of prior dyspepsia.  Most peptic ulcers are caused by Helicobacter pylori infection or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use; other risk factors include smoking, older age, and glucocorticoid use. $Duodenal ulcers are more common than gastric ulcers and tend to occur anteriorly.  Ulcers located on the anterior wall of the duodenal bulb are more prone to perforation; those on the posterior wall are more likely to cause hemorrhage.  These complications are explained by the relationship of the duodenal bulb to adjacent organs.  The duodenal bulb is approximately 5 cm long, beginning at the pylorus and ending at the neck of the gallbladder.  The gallbladder and liver lie anterior to the duodenal bulb within the intraperitoneal space; the gastroduodenal artery, common biliary duct, and portal vein are posterior to the bulb; and the head of the pancreas is located inferiorly. $When an ulcer penetrates the #posterior duodenal wall#, it is likely to erode into the @gastroduodenal artery@, which perfuses both the pylorus and the proximal part of the duodenum.  Damage to the gastroduodenal artery can cause significant #upper gastrointestinal bleeding#. $#(Choice A)#  The common hepatic artery arises from the celiac trunk and bifurcates into the proper hepatic and gastroduodenal arteries.  It passes superior to the duodenal bulb. $#(Choice C)#  The inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery is a branch of the superior mesenteric artery.  It supplies blood to the lower duodenum and to the head of the pancreas.  This artery has no close relation to the duodenal bulb. $#(Choices D, E, and F)#  The left gastroepiploic and right gastric arteries supply blood to the greater and lesser curves of the stomach, respectively.  The short gastric arteries arise off the splenic artery and supply the upper portions of the greater curvature.  These vessels do not lie in close proximity to the duodenal bulb. $#(Choice G)#  The superior mesenteric artery lies anterior to the transverse part of the duodenum.  It arises from the anterior surface of the abdominal aorta and supplies the intestine from the duodenum to the proximal two-thirds of the transverse colon. $#Educational objective# The gastroduodenal artery lies along the posterior wall of the duodenal bulb and is likely to be eroded by posterior duodenal ulcers.  Ulceration into the gastroduodenal artery can be a source of life-threatening hemorrhage.  ",

The most common cause of pneumoperitoneum is a perforated duodenal ulcer, but perforation can occur anywhere along the gastrointestinal (or female reproductive) tract due to ulcers, tumors, trauma, or iatrogenic causes (eg, endoscopy, surgery). $Contamination of the sterile peritoneal cavity with bowel contents leads to chemical (acid or chyme-related) or bacterial #peritonitis#, which, if left untreated, can progress to sepsis and death.  Diffuse irritation of the parietal peritoneum results in severe abdominal pain with #rigidity #and #rebound tenderness#.  #Shoulder pain# is another frequent finding and reflects referred pain from diaphragmatic irritation.  Referred pain is due to convergence of multiple nociceptors (visceral and somatic) onto a single secondary neuron within the spinal cord, which causes the brain to misinterpret visceral pain as arising from a body surface. $#(Choice A)#  Other common causes of abdominal pain with associated diaphragmatic irritation and referred shoulder pain include acute cholecystitis/biliary colic and splenic lacerations.

These glands are most numerous in the first part of the #duodenum# (near the pylorus) but may be found intermittently up to the ampulla of Vater.  The ducts of these glands pass through the muscularis mucosa and terminate in the mucosal crypts (crypts of Lieberkühn). $• The epithelial cells of the pancreatic ductules and ducts produce watery secretions containing high concentrations of bicarbonate ions.  The strongly alkaline #pancreatic secretions# are then emptied into the duodenum at the ampulla. $Bicarbonate secretion from the submucosal glands is induced by tactile stimulation of the duodenal mucosa and increased parasympathetic activity following meals.  In addition, the presence of acid in the duodenum causes the release of #secretin# from the mucosa, which stimulates bicarbonate secretion from the submucosal glands and pancreas. $Excess gastric acid secretion (eg, caused by antral Helicobacter pylori infection) can eventually lead to #hyperplasia# of the submucosal glands, imparting a nodular appearance endoscopically.  Increasing levels of gastric acid may ultimately overwhelm the mucosal defense systems, resulting in duodenal mucosal injury (eg, epigastric discomfort, bloating, flatulence, bleeding). $#(Choices A and C)#  The antrum of the stomach contains numerous mucosal pyloric glands that secrete copious mucus for protection.  The body and fundus of the stomach contain mucosal oxyntic glands that secrete gastric acid.  However, submucosal glands are not present in the stomach. $#(Choice D)#  The mucosal villi and crypts in the jejunum contain goblet cells (secrete mucus) and enterocytes (secrete water and electrolytes); these secretions have only minimal bicarbonate content.  Submucosal glands are not present in the jejunum. $#(Choices E and F)#  Bicarbonate is secreted by epithelial cells in the ileal villi and colonic crypts to neutralize acid produced by colonic bacteria.  Submucosal glands are not present in these locations. $#Educational objective# Gastric acid is neutralized by bicarbonate from the submucosal (Brunner) glands of the duodenum and from pancreatic duct secretions.  Chronic overproduction of gastric acid can lead to hyperplasia of the submucosal glands.  ",

In the procedure, the esophageal hiatus is tightened, and the gastric fundus is wrapped around the lower esophageal sphincter, thereby preventing gastric acid from entering the esophagus.$However, the #anterior and posterior vagal trunks# (branches of the vagus nerve) also pass through the esophageal hiatus and are vulnerable to injury during fundoplication. These nerves supply parasympathetic innervation to the gastrointestinal tract and stimulate gastric muscle contraction and motility. Injury to the vagal trunks can lead to #delayed gastric emptying# (ie, gastroparesis), manifesting with abdominal pain, early satiety, and postprandial emesis.$(Choice B) The phrenic nerve innervates the diaphragm; it originates from the C3-C5 nerve roots and passes through the mediastinum between the heart and the lungs.

Cirrhosis is the most common cause of #portal hypertension#, which arises from increased resistance to portal flow at the hepatic sinusoids.  Chronic portal hypertension leads to dilation of small, pre-existing vascular channels between the portal and systemic circulations.  These dilated collateral vessels (@portosystemic anastomoses@) commonly form in the anterior abdomen (caput medusae), lower rectum (anorectal varices), and #inferior end of the esophagus# (esophageal varices). $Treatment sometimes includes inserting a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) between the portal vein and hepatic vein percutaneously, relieving portal hypertension by shunting blood to the systemic circulation. $#(Choice B)#  The middle colic vein drains the transverse colon. $#(Choices C and F)#  In cirrhosis, the paraumbilical veins can shunt blood from the portal system to superficial epigastric veins in the abdominal wall, causing @caput medusae@. $#(Choice D)#  The right gastroepiploic vein drains venous blood from the inferior portions of the stomach.  It runs along the greater curvature of the stomach. $#(Choice E)#  The splenic vein drains blood from the spleen.  It joins with the superior mesenteric vein to form the hepatic portal vein.  Patients with portal hypertension can develop splenomegaly due to congestion of the splenic red pulp. $#Educational objective# In cirrhosis, portal hypertension arises from increased resistance to portal flow at the hepatic sinusoids.  This causes increased pressure in the portosystemic collateral veins within the lower end of the esophagus, anterior abdomen, and lower rectum.  Dilation of these collateral vessels is responsible for the esophageal varices, caput medusae, and anorectal varices commonly seen in patients with cirrhosis.  ",

      "explanation_2": "Infarcts in an otherwise normal liver are rare because it has a dual blood supply: the portal vein and hepatic artery. Should the hepatic artery become occluded, the portal venous supply and retrograde arterial flow through accessory vessels (e.g., from the inferior phrenic, adrenal, intercostal arteries, etc.) is typically sufficient to sustain the liver parenchyma. The notable exception is when a transplanted liver undergoes hepatic artery thrombosis. In this case, the liver can develop biliary tree infarction and organ failure because the collateral blood supply is severed during transplantation.$(Choice A) The spleen is relatively vulnerable to infarction because the perfusion via the splenic artery is end-arterial. Wedge-shaped, capsule-based splenic infarcts occur and are a known complication of sickle cell anemia, infective endocarditis, and cardiac mural thrombosis.$(Choice B) Irreversible damage appears to occur in the most vulnerable of neurons after approximately 5 minutes of complete ischemia.$(Choice C) The kidney, similar to the spleen, has an end-arterial blood supply, and is generally able to tolerate warm ischemia for at least 30 minutes. Longer periods of complete ischemia result in immediate functional loss; late recovery of renal function is incomplete or absent.$(Choice E) The myocardium can endure complete arterial ischemia for twenty or thirty minutes without severe consequences. Briefer periods of ischemia do not result in necrosis, but rather myocardial stunning. Coronary artery embolism is an uncommon cause of myocardial infarction; nonetheless, it should be considered in myocardial-infarcted patients with atrial fibrillation, infective endocarditis, left atrial or ventricular thrombus, and in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization.$Educational objective Organ susceptibility to infarction after occlusion of a feeding artery is ranked from greatest to least as follows: central nervous system, myocardium, kidney, spleen, and liver. The presence of a dual and/or collateral blood supply (as seen in the liver, which is supplied by the hepatic artery and portal vein) enables an organ to tolerate arterial occlusion better than those with end-arterial circulations."

The effects of prolonged portal hypertension include varices at the four sites of portocaval anastomoses (esophagus, rectum, umbilicus, and retroperitoneal), as well as ascites.$The pathogenesis of ascites in patients with cirrhosis is complex. In addition to mechanical compromise of portal vein flow by fibrotic tissue, vasoactive agents also play a role by causing dilatation of the splanchnic arterial vasculature and further intrahepatic vasoconstriction. These processes result in increased portal vein hydrostatic pressure leading to ascitic fluid formation, as well as decreased systemic perfusion pressure. The kidney senses the decreased perfusion pressure (accentuated by renal vasoconstriction in hepatorenal syndrome) and responds with avid retention of sodium and water, thus promoting further increase in ascitic fluid formation. Treatment of ascites secondary to cirrhosis involves restriction of sodium intake combined with diuretics. The most commonly prescribed initial therapy is a combination of furosemide and spironolactone.$(Choice A) The descending abdominal aorta will have elevated pressures in patients with systemic hypertension.$(Choice B) The inferior vena cava experiences increased pressure in cases of heart failure. This patient does not present with the typical symptoms associated with heart failure, such as lower extremity edema and shortness of breath.$(Choice D) The celiac trunk emerges from the aorta at this level (T12 / L1).$Educational objective The portal vein can be identified on cross-sectional scans lying medial to (or just within) the right lobe of the liver and anterior to the inferior vena cava. The pressure in the portal system is elevated in liver cirrhosis."

Patients typically present with persistent right upper quadrant pain, fever, and leukocytosis.  Examination classically shows Murphy sign, an inspiratory pause elicited by pain during deep palpation of the right upper quadrant.  Symptoms are often preceded by transient episodes of abdominal pain and nausea after fatty meals due to temporary cystic duct obstruction (biliary colic). $ Persistent gallbladder outflow obstruction promotes hydrolysis of luminal lecithins to lysolecithins, which disrupts the protective mucus layer.  The luminal epithelium is then exposed to the detergent action of the bile salts, resulting in chemical irritation and prostaglandin release.  Inflammation of the mucosa and deeper tissues causes gallbladder hypomotility.  The increasing distension and internal pressure within the gallbladder eventually result in ischemia.

Stage reflects the #degree of tumor invasion and spread# from the initial site of formation.  Colorectal tumors confined to the basement membrane or lamina propria are considered to be carcinoma in situ and have an excellent 5-year survival rate (>90%).  Invasion of the tumor into the muscularis propria, the location of the colonic lymphatic channels, is associated with a slightly worse prognosis (5-year survival rate of 70%-80%) due to elevated rates of tumor spread through lymphatics or to adjacent organs. $ The prognosis of colon cancer deteriorates when tumor cells are identified in regional lymph nodes (5-year survival rate of 50%-80%).  #Lymph node spread# is thought to be one of the strongest predictors of metastatic potential and, therefore, indicates an #increased risk# for incurable, distant disease.  Metastatic spread to distant organs (eg, lungs, liver) is associated with the worst 5-year survival rates (<15%). $ (Choice A)  Tumor grade, the degree of cellular differentiation of tumor cells, also affects prognosis.  Well-differentiated (low-grade) colonic tumors have glandular structure and are associated with a better prognosis than poorly differentiated (high-grade) colonic tumors, which appear as sheets or cords of cells with pleomorphism, high mitotic rates, and other signs of significant cellular aberration.  Grade is a less important prognostic indicator than stage. $ (Choice B)  Cytokeratin 20 is a marker of intestinal cell differentiation.  Testing for the presence of this structural protein helps confirm that adenocarcinomas are of intestinal origin; it is not a prognostic indicator. $ (Choice C)  The invasion of colorectal cancer into the lamina propria is considered to be carcinoma in situ because lymphatic channels do not arise until the subsequent layer (muscularis propria).  Patients with colorectal tumors confined to the basement membrane or lamina propria have an excellent prognosis. $ (Choice D)  Cytotoxic T-cell (lymphocytic) invasion of tumor cells is a favorable prognostic indicator as it signifies immune recognition.  It is associated with a lower risk of metastases and improved survival. $ Educational objective Tumor stage (degree of invasion/spread) is the most important prognostic determinant for colorectal cancer.  Tumors confined to the basement membrane and lamina propria are early stage and have the best prognosis.  Outcomes generally deteriorate as the stage advances: spread of tumor into the muscularis propria → regional lymph nodes → distant sites."

This is demonstrated histologically by #lymphocyte and plasma cell# infiltration of #portal and periportal# regions of the liver. $ (Choice A)  Chronic hepatitis B is characterized histologically by ground-glass hepatocytes, which result from the accumulation of hepatitis B surface antigen within their cytoplasm, as well as central balloon degeneration, which reflects hepatocytes undergoing apoptosis. $ (Choice B)  Hepatic steatosis (ie, lipid accumulation in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes) and ballooning degeneration most commonly occur in alcohol-induced hepatitis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.  Elevated anti–smooth muscle antibody titers do not occur. $ (Choice C)  Acetaminophen overdose can lead to hepatic inflammation and necrosis with neutrophilic infiltration (unlike AIH, which is characterized by lymphoplasmocytic infiltrates).  Patients often have vomiting, diaphoresis, and confusion. $ (Choice D)  Primary sclerosing cholangitis causes periductal fibrosis and luminal obliteration of the biliary ducts, which can lead to cholestasis.  High alkaline phosphatase levels and near-normal aminotransferases are expected. $ Educational objective Autoimmune hepatitis results from an immune response against hepatic antigens, leading to a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate in the portal and periportal regions of the liver.  Manifestations include fatigue, weight loss, nausea, and/or signs of acute hepatitis (eg, jaundice, abdominal discomfort).  Characteristic laboratory abnormalities include a hepatocellular pattern of liver injury, anti–smooth muscle autoantibodies, and hypergammaglobulinemia."

The gallbladder functions to actively absorb water from bile; conditions that cause gallbladder hypomotility result in excessive dehydration of bile.  This promotes the precipitation and accumulation of particulate material (eg, cholesterol monohydrate crystals, calcium bilirubinate, mucus) in bile, forming viscous #biliary sludge#.  Sludge formation may be asymptomatic or cause biliary colic (right upper quadrant abdominal pain associated with nausea) and is a known precursor to stone formation (particularly cholesterol stones).  Complications such as acute cholecystitis and cholangitis can also occur in patients with biliary sludge. $ #(Choices B and C)# Pigment gallstones can be brown or black and arise from conditions that increase the amount of unconjugated bilirubin in bile.  Brown pigment stones are associated with biliary tract infections (microbes producing β-glucuronidases), whereas black stones occur with chronic hemolytic anemias (eg, sickle cell disease) and increased enterohepatic cycling of bilirubin (eg, Crohn disease, which also decreases enterohepatic cycling of bile acids).  This patient has no risk factors for pigment stones, and her gallbladder dysmotility makes biliary sludge a more likely diagnosis. $ (Choice D)  Cystinuria is an autosomal recessive condition characterized by a defect in an amino acid transporter gene, resulting in elevated urinary cystine concentrations.  Patients typically present with cystine kidney stones during childhood or adolescence. $ (Choice E)  Individuals with high serum uric acid levels are at increased risk of developing uric acid kidney stones.  Hyperuricemia can be caused by uric acid underexcretion (eg, thiazide diuretics) or overproduction (eg, tumor lysis syndrome). $ Educational objective The gallbladder functions to actively absorb water from bile.  Gallbladder hypomotility causes the bile to become concentrated, promoting precipitation and accumulation of particulate material.

Cirrhosis can sometimes occur due to chronic obstruction of the biliary ducts, but almost always develops during childhood. $ (Choice D)  Defective copper transport resulting in accumulation of intracellular copper occurs in Wilson disease.  Patients can develop cirrhosis as well as brain degeneration leading to neurologic (eg, dysarthria, gait abnormalities) and psychiatric (eg, impulsivity) manifestations. $ (Choice F)  Unregulated gastrointestinal iron absorption occurs in hemochromatosis.  Patients can develop cirrhosis due to iron overload.  The joints (arthritis), pancreas (diabetes mellitus), and heart (cardiomyopathy) are also commonly affected, but lung involvement is not typical. $ Educational objective Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is a serine protease inhibitor that regulates the activity of elastase in the lung.  Inherited deficiency of AAT leads to alveolar destruction and panacinar emphysema; in addition, accumulation of improperly folded AAT proteins in hepatocytes can lead to liver dysfunction and cirrhosis in some patients.",

Noncaseating granulomas are seen only in a minority of patients with CD but, when present, are highly suggestive of the diagnosis.  Microscopically, granulomas contain a large number of epithelioid macrophages that may fuse together to form multinucleated cells (Langhans giant cells), surrounded by a band of lymphocytes. $ Granulomas are considered caseating or noncaseating: $ • #Caseating#: Central necrosis is present and has a granular, cheesy appearance.  Caseating granulomas are typically seen in infectious etiologies (eg, tuberculosis, leprosy, syphilis, cat scratch disease) due to cell death (both macrophage and bacterial) and the release of cellular contents. $ • #Noncaseating#: No central necrosis is present.  Noncaseating granulomas are typically seen in autoinflammatory conditions (eg, CD, sarcoidosis, common variable immune deficiency). $ Granuloma formation is a product of chronic T-lymphocyte and macrophage activation in response to a difficult-to-eradicate antigen (eg, mycobacterium, self-antigens).  Macrophages release tumor necrosis factor–alpha and other proinflammatory cytokines (eg, IL-6, IL-1, #IL-12#) that promote macrophage migration and #Th1 cell differentiation#.  Th1 cells are thought to be important in granuloma organization; they produce IL-2 and #interferon-gamma#, which promote further T-cell response, #activation of macrophages#, and differentiation of macrophages into giant cells.

The formation of @pseudomembranes@ (white-yellow plaques composed of fibrin, inflammatory cells, and cellular debris) on the colonic mucosa is highly consistent with pseudomembranous colitis due to #Clostridioides difficile#, a spore-forming bacillus that colonizes up to 50% of hospitalized adults. #Antibiotic therapy# (eg, fluoroquinolones for bacterial pneumonia) #increases the risk# of C difficile infection because it kills intestinal microbes that normally keep potential pathogens in check.  C difficile can proliferate in the altered microbiome, leading to overgrowth and clinical disease. $ C difficile produces 2 toxins—toxin A (enterotoxin) and toxin B (cytotoxin)—which penetrate colonic epithelial cells and damage cellular cytoskeletons and intercellular tight junctions.  This results in widespread inflammation, edema, necrosis, and fibrin deposition.  Clinical manifestations range from watery diarrhea and mild abdominal cramping to fulminant colitis with nonobstructive colonic enlargement (megacolon) and intestinal perforation. $ #(Choices A and B)# Ingestion of undercooked shellfish is associated with Vibrio, Norwalk virus, and hepatitis A infections.  Traveler's diarrhea, caused by bacteria (eg, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella) or parasites (eg, Giardia), is often due to contaminated water consumption.  These conditions can manifest as diarrhea and abdominal pain; however, pseudomembranes are virtually pathognomonic for C difficile colitis. $ (Choice C)  Consumption of undercooked pork is a risk factor for intestinal tapeworm (taeniasis), which occurs after ingestion of Taenia solium.  Patients are often asymptomatic but may have nausea or abdominal pain. $ (Choice E)  Adult botulism occurs after ingestion of preformed toxin in home-canned food.  This neurotoxin inhibits acetylcholine release from the nerve terminals at neuromuscular junctions and causes a descending flaccid paralysis. $ Educational objective Antibiotics disrupt the normal intestinal flora and can allow for overgrowth of Clostridioides difficile, an anaerobic, gram-positive, spore-forming bacillus.

It is protected from gastric acid by endogenous urease production: #urease# converts urea to ammonia, which alkalinizes the surrounding pH but injures gastric epithelial cells.  Damage to the gastric mucosa is compounded by localized inflammation due to the immunologic response against H pylori. $ Chronic inflammation due to H pylori colonization in the #gastric antrum# leads to #depletion of somatostatin-producing cells# (@delta cells@), which are located mostly in the antrum.  Somatostatin inhibits gastrin release from G-cells.  In its absence, #elevated gastrin# levels act directly (via cholecystokinin B receptors) and indirectly (via histamine release by enterochromaffin-like cells) to #increase acid secretion# by parietal cells.  In addition, H pylori releases cytotoxins that inhibit duodenal production of bicarbonate.  The resultant increased acid load is emptied into the under-protected duodenum, leading to #duodenal ulcer# formation. $ In contrast, gastric ulcers occur when H pylori colonizes the gastric body (corpus) #(choice D)#.  Chronic inflammation leads to multifocal atrophic gastritis and a reduction in the number of acid-producing @parietal cells@, which are located mostly in the gastric body.  Delta cells in the antrum are not markedly reduced, therefore acid secretion is often low to normal.  Gastric ulcer formation results from direct mucosal damage caused by bacterial products (eg, ammonia, cytotoxins) and the resultant inflammatory response.  Unlike antral-predominant disease, corpus-predominant disease is associated with metaplasia and malignancies (eg, gastric lymphoma, adenocarcinoma) #(choice C)#. $ (Choice A)  Chronic pancreatitis is not associated with H pylori infection.  It is most frequently caused by chronic alcoholism or obstruction of the pancreatic ducts due to gallstones or malignancy. $ (Choice E)  Vitamin B12 deficiency can result from autoimmune gastritis.  Autoimmune gastritis is characterized by autoantibodies against gastric parietal cells leading to inflammation of the gastric mucosa, parietal cell destruction, and achlorhydria.  Its etiology is at least partially genetic. $ Educational objective Helicobacter pylori antral gastritis is associated with the formation of duodenal ulcers due to increased gastric acid production.  This increase in acidity is caused by unchecked gastrin production due to the destruction of somatostatin-secreting cells in the gastric antrum.",

        "explanation_2": "$Liver neoplasms are most often due to #metastases# from distant tumors rather than primary liver cancer (eg, hepatocellular carcinoma).  Metastatic disease to the liver is particularly likely when #multiple tumors# are present (as seen in this case) and there is no history of underlying hepatic disease such as alcohol-induced cirrhosis or hepatitis C.  The liver is vulnerable to the metastatic spread of cancer due to the following anatomic considerations: $ • The presence of #fenestrated hepatic sinusoidal epithelium#, which allows tumor cells to easily pass from the bloodstream through to the parenchyma.$ • #Dual blood supply# from the portal and systemic circulation, which increases the likelihood of circulating tumor cells depositing in the liver. $ The most common cause of liver metastases is #colorectal cancer#, which spreads directly from the colon or superior rectum through the #portal venous system# to the liver.  This patient, who has not received recommended cancer screening (eg, colonoscopy), likely developed hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer.  Gastric and pancreatic cancers also frequently spread through the portal system to the liver. $ (Choice A)  Lymphatic spread of tumor cells is a common mechanism of metastases, but it is not the primary source of most metastatic liver lesions. $ (Choice B)  Tumors (eg, breast, lung, melanoma) can spread to the liver through the systemic circulation via the hepatic artery (rather than the portal circulation).  The hepatic vein drains out of the liver; it does not bring blood into the liver. $ (Choice D)  Primary hepatic cancer is thirtyfold less common than metastatic disease.  Most primary lesions are solitary tumors and arise in individuals with underlying liver disease.  This patient, who did not have recommended cancer screening (eg, colonoscopy) and has multiple liver tumors, most likely has metastatic disease. $ (Choice E)  Although gastrointestinal cancers can spread to the peritoneum and then invade the liver, this is much less common than hematogenous dissemination through the portal system.  Metastasis through the peritoneal space most commonly occurs with ovarian cancer and gastric (Krukenberg) tumors. $ Educational objective Most hepatic neoplasms are due to metastatic disease from a distant site.  Colorectal cancer is the most common cause of hepatic metastases due to direct blood flow from the colon (and superior rectum) to the liver via the portal venous circulation."

In the newborn, lack of bacterial enzymes due to relative gut sterility results in an increased bilirubin concentration remaining in the intestines.  This excess bilirubin is deconjugated by intestinal beta-glucuronidase and then reabsorbed via the enterohepatic circulation #(choice B)#. $ Benign neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is typically asymptomatic except for scleral icterus and @jaundice@.

Patients with this disorder develop hundreds or thousands of #colonic polyps# in the second or third decade of life.  These polyps behave similarly to colonic polyps that form in patients who do not have FAP (spontaneous polyps): they typically grow over time, do not regress, and are associated with a progressive risk for high-grade dysplasia and transformation to invasive cancer as they enlarge.  Because patients with FAP have innumerable polyps, the risk that one or more will transform into invasive #colonic carcinoma is nearly 100%#. Therefore, colectomy is generally recommended. $ FAP is caused by a germline mutation to the tumor suppressor gene #adenomatous polyposis coli# (APC).  The APC gene encodes for a protein that destroys beta-catenin.  Loss of the APC protein results in elevated beta-catenin levels, which stimulates a transcriptional activator that leads to proliferation of intestinal crypt cells (and the subsequent formation of polyps).  Patients may also have extracolonic manifestations such as gastric or duodenal polyps, desmoid tumors, and brain cancer, but these manifestations have lower penetrance than colonic polyps. $ Loss of control of the APC pathway is a crucial first step in the development of both hereditary and sporadic forms of colon cancer.  Nearly 80% of sporadic colon cancers have somatic mutations to both APC alleles; the remainder usually have activating mutations to the downstream products of this pathway. $ Educational objective Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by germline mutation to the tumor suppressor gene adenomatous polyposis coli.

Patients with ulcerative colitis, particularly pancolitis, are at highest risk.  #Colitis-associated colorectal cancer# (CA-CRC) occurs in areas of chronic inflammation, and the risk is proportionate to the duration and severity of inflammation. $ #(Choices A, B, and D)#  Unlike sporadic CRC, which typically progresses slowly from a singular dysplastic polyp, CA-CRC is typically more #aggressive#, often evolves from flat (#nonpolypoid#) lesions, and is frequently #multifocal# (ie, multiple synchronous carcinomas) at diagnosis.  CA-CRC often affects a #younger# population than sporadic CRC.  These malignancies are more likely to have a #higher histopathologic grade#, with poorly differentiated or anaplastic cells and a high number of mucinous or signet ring cells.  The molecular pathogenesis of CA-CRC is also different than that of sporadic disease, with p53 mutations occurring early in the course of malignant development and APC mutations occurring much later. $ Given the high risk for CRC and the difficulty of colonoscopic visualization of flat or multifocal lesions, it is important to regularly monitor IBD via colonoscopy with random biopsies. $ Educational objective Inflammatory bowel disease, especially ulcerative pancolitis, is associated with a significant risk for colorectal carcinoma.

CD is an inflammatory bowel disease that occurs most commonly in young adults.  It typically presents as recurrent episodes of abdominal pain associated with diarrhea, low-grade fevers, and fatigue; symptoms may worsen during periods of stress.  The inflammation can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from the mouth to the anus and is typically patchy with interspersed areas of normal bowel (skip lesions).  CD is characterized by #transmural inflammation# (all layers of the bowel wall are involved), which predisposes to several complications: $ • #Strictures# occur as a result of bowel wall edema, fibrosis, and #hypertrophy (thickening)# of the @muscularis mucosae@, which narrows the intestinal lumen.  This can progress  to #bowel obstruction#. $ • Fistulas occur when ulcers penetrate the entire thickness of the intestinal wall, leading to a sinus tract that communicates between multiple organs (eg, enterovesicular, enterovaginal, enteroenteric). $ • @Abscesses@ form when sinus tracts become walled off.  They can also perforate, leading to diffuse peritonitis. $ (Choice A)  Caseating granulomas are typically seen in multiple infectious processes, most notably tuberculosis (TB).  Abdominal TB can present with abdominal pain, fevers, and occasional obstruction; however, symptoms are unlikely to spontaneously wax and wane, and evidence of TB is often present in other sites (eg, hemoptysis with pulmonary TB).  CD is associated with noncaseating, rather than caseating, granulomas. $ (Choice B)  Flask-shaped ulcers in the cecum and colon are seen in Entamoeba histolytica infection, which occurs more commonly in developing countries and presents with bloody diarrhea.

Inflammation involves contiguous areas of the colon only, and the small bowel is not involved.  Due to the superficial nature of the inflammation, strictures and fistulas are not seen. $ (Choice D)  @Pseudomembranes@ composed of fibrin and inflammatory debris are seen with Clostridium difficile infection, which is typically associated with antibiotic use.

Surgery (particularly of the stomach and biliary tract and after cardiac surgery) $ 7. Hypercalcemia$ High levels of circulating triglycerides lead to increased production of free fatty acids within the pancreatic capillaries by pancreatic lipase.  Normally, fatty acids exist in serum bound to albumin.  However, if serum #triglyceride levels rise to >1000 mg/dL#, the concentration of free fatty acids exceeds the binding capacity of albumin and leads to direct injury to the pancreatic acinar cells.  Thus, hypertriglyceridemia causes acute pancreatitis via direct tissue toxicity. $ (Choice A)  Decreased serum ceruloplasmin and increased hepatic copper content are diagnostic of Wilson disease.  Cirrhosis, central nervous system involvement, and Kayser-Fleischer rings are characteristic findings.  Wilson disease does not predispose to acute pancreatitis. $ (Choice B)  Increased serum cholesterol levels predispose to the development of systemic atherosclerosis, putting patients at increased risk for coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and stroke.  In some cases, hypercholesterolemia may increase the risk of cholesterol gallstone formation, but this patient's negative gallbladder ultrasound makes this a less likely cause of his pancreatitis. $ (Choice C)  High concentrations of serum ferritin are found in hemochromatosis.  Hemochromatosis can cause cirrhosis, pancreatic fibrosis and subsequent diabetes, cardiomyopathy, and secondary hypogonadism.

It is therefore particularly useful in determining whether an elevated alkaline phosphatase is of hepatic or bony origin. $ (Choice A)  Measurement of unconjugated bilirubin (especially in contrast to conjugated bilirubin) can be of assistance in distinguishing hemolytic conditions from hepatic dysfunction or bile duct obstruction.  This test is not particularly helpful in following up an elevated alkaline phosphatase. $ (Choice B)  Lactate dehydrogenase is a relatively nonspecific test that can be of some assistance in the evaluation of tissue injury or death.  It is not the most helpful test in following up an elevated alkaline phosphatase. $ (Choice C)  Serum ammonia levels can be of assistance in determining the extent of liver failure or gastrointestinal bleeding, among other conditions.  It is not the most helpful test in following up an elevated alkaline phosphatase. $ (Choice D)  Prothrombin time is of assistance in assessing coagulative ability and liver functionality, especially in the acute setting.  It is not the most helpful test in following up an elevated alkaline phosphatase. $ (Choice F)  Aspartate aminotransferase is of assistance in assessing and monitoring hepatic damage.  It is not the most helpful test in following up an elevated alkaline phosphatase. $ Educational Objective A moderately elevated alkaline phosphatase of unclear etiology should be followed up with γ-glutamyl transpeptidase."

        "explanation_2": "This patient most likely has #food protein–induced allergic proctocolitis#, a benign condition of early infancy (age <6 months).  Affected infants have a #non–IgE-mediated reaction# to proteins found in breast milk or formula (most common trigger is cow's milk).  #Painless, blood-streaked stools# (which may also be loose and contain mucus) typically develop weeks to months after initial exposure to the food allergen. $ Diagnosis is clinical.  Although endoscopy is not performed unless symptoms are atypical (eg, severe bleeding, constipation, vomiting), characteristic findings include #inflammation# (ie, erythema, edema) confined to the #distal colon# and rectum.  Histopathology findings include infiltration of #eosinophils# within the lamina propria and muscularis mucosa. $ Management includes dietary avoidance of the trigger protein (eg, switching to a hydrolyzed formula, maternal elimination of dairy for breastfed infants).  Symptoms typically resolve within weeks, and most infants can tolerate the offending protein by age 1. $ (Choice B)  Hemorrhagic necrosis of the bowel wall describes @necrotizing enterocolitis@, a gastrointestinal emergency that can result in gut ischemia and death if untreated (eg, bowel rest, antibiotics).  In addition to rectal bleeding, patients often have abdominal distension, poor feeding, and hemodynamic instability, none of which is present in this patient. $ (Choices C and D)  A Meckel diverticulum can contain @heterotopic gastric mucosa@ in the distal ileum, and @neutrophilic crypt abscesses@ can be seen with ulcerative colitis.  Although these conditions, which are both exceedingly rare in the neonatal period, can cause blood in the stool, neither would resolve with a change in formula. $ Educational objective Food protein–induced allergic proctocolitis is a non–IgE-mediated reaction that causes inflammation and eosinophilic infiltration of the distal colon.  Classic presentation is in early infancy with painless, blood-streaked stools that resolve with dietary avoidance of the offending food protein (eg, cow's milk).",

        "explanation_2": "$This infant has #pneumatosis intestinalis# (ie, air in the bowel wall), which can be seen on abdominal x-ray as thin curvilinear areas of lucency that parallel the lumen.  In an infant with abdominal distension and bloody stools, this finding is diagnostic for #necrotizing enterocolitis# (NEC). $ NEC is one of the most frequent gastrointestinal emergencies affecting newborns.  It occurs predominantly in #preterm infants# secondary to gastrointestinal and immunologic immaturity.  Upon initiation of enteral feeding, bacteria are introduced into the bowel where they proliferate excessively due to compromised immune clearance.  Impaired mucosal barrier function allows the bacteria to invade the bowel wall, causing inflammation and #ischemic necrosis# of the terminal ileum and colon.  As the disease progresses, the bowel becomes congested and gangrenous with the formation of #intramural gas collections#. $ Up to 30% of affected neonates die, especially when disease is complicated by intestinal perforation.  Survivors are at risk for strictures and #bowel obstruction# secondary to fibrosis that occurs as the inflammation subsides. $ (Choice A)  Duodenal atresia classically presents with the @double bubble sign@ of air in the stomach and proximal duodenal pouch.  Affected infants generally have bilious emesis shortly after birth. $ (Choice B)  Hirschsprung disease manifests with failure to pass meconium in the first 48 hours after birth.  On x-ray, the large intestine appears dilated proximal to the aganglionic portion of bowel; contrast enema will show a narrow-caliber @transition zone@. $ (Choice C)  Malrotation of the bowel occurs when the midgut does not rotate normally during the first trimester, leaving the small and large bowel malpositioned.  Malrotated bowel is at high risk of obstruction and ischemia due to twisting around its blood supply (volvulus).  However, the finding of pneumatosis intestinalis is more specific for necrotizing enterocolitis. $ (Choice E)  Pyloric stenosis is caused by hypertrophy of the pyloric sphincter and leads to gastric outlet obstruction.  It presents with nonbilious vomiting after feeding and a palpable ball of muscle (\"olive\") in the abdomen.  Pyloric stenosis is not associated with bloody stools or pneumatosis intestinalis. $ Educational objective Necrotizing enterocolitis is one of the most common gastrointestinal emergencies affecting newborns.  It is characterized by bacterial invasion and ischemic necrosis of the bowel wall, and is associated with prematurity and initiation of enteral feeding.  Abdominal x-ray showing pneumatosis intestinalis (ie, air in the bowel wall) confirms the diagnosis.",

Patients often have multiple, small (<1 cm), circular lesions in the stomach, ranging from superficial erosions to full-thickness ulcers.

Ulcers arising in the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum in patients with intracranial injury are particularly prone to perforation and are called #Cushing ulcers#.  Cushing ulcers are a consequence of #direct vagus nerve stimulation# caused by elevated intracranial pressure, resulting in acetylcholine release and hypersecretion of gastric acid. $ (Choice A)  Chronic gastritis with antral sparing is characteristic of autoimmune gastritis.  CD4+ T cell-mediated parietal cell destruction causes impaired gastric acid and intrinsic factor secretion, resulting in achlorhydria and pernicious anemia, respectively. $ (Choice B)  Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is caused by a gastrin-secreting tumor (gastrinoma) that is usually located in the small intestine or pancreas.  Patients classically have multiple peptic ulcers that may involve the distal duodenum and are more likely to respond poorly to therapy. $ (Choice C)  Granulomatous gastritis is most often idiopathic but may be associated with Crohn disease, sarcoidosis, or mycobacterial infection.  It is characterized by intramucosal epithelioid granulomas that cause narrowing of the antrum secondary to transmural inflammation, which can result in gastric outlet obstruction. $ (Choice D)  Peptic ulcers in the stomach or duodenum are most commonly due to Helicobacter pylori infection or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use.  H pylori infection is also associated with chronic antral-predominant gastritis. $ (Choice E)  Gastric adenocarcinoma can occur as the intestinal subtype (ie, bulky mass composed of glandular structures) or diffuse subtype (ie, gross stomach wall thickening with signet-ring cells on microscopy).  Risk factors for gastric adenocarcinoma include chronic gastritis, cigarette smoking, H pylori infection, and a diet high in salt/nitrosamines. $ Educational objective Stress-related mucosal disease is usually caused by local ischemia in the setting of severe physiologic stress (eg, shock, extensive burns, sepsis, severe trauma).

Destruction of somatostatin-producing cells in the antrum leads to #unchecked gastrin secretion# and results in excess production of stomach acid and an increased risk of #duodenal ulcers#. $ If left untreated, #chronic# H pylori infection typically #spreads# to involve the corpus (body) and fundus of the stomach and is characterized by patchy, #multifocal gastric atrophy# with intestinal metaplasia.  Patchy destruction of parietal and G cells results in #diminished acid secretion# and hypochlorhydria.  Patients with chronic gastritis are less likely to develop duodenal ulcers but due to the associated #chronic inflammation#, they are at increased risk of #gastric ulcers# and malignancy, particularly #gastric lymphoma# (ie, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue [MALT] lymphoma) and gastric adenocarcinoma. $ (Choice B)  H pylori–associated ulcers can cause gastric outlet obstruction, not gastroparesis, which is commonly due to uncontrolled diabetes or infiltrative diseases (eg, scleroderma). $ (Choice C)  Celiac disease is an immune-mediated response to a protein in gluten and can cause microcytic anemia due to iron malabsorption.  Autoimmune diseases are associated with autoimmune gastritis, not H pylori infection. $ (Choice D)  Ileal obstruction can occur due to Crohn disease, which can also cause abdominal pain and blood-loss anemia.  However, H pylori infects gastric mucosa; the ileum is typically unaffected. $ (Choice E)  Unlike chronic H pylori-associated atrophic gastritis, which causes patchy atrophy with sparing of some parietal cells (allowing for continued intrinsic factor production and B12 absorption), autoimmune gastritis is characterized by diffuse and more complete immune-mediated destruction of parietal cells and intrinsic factor.  This results in impaired vitamin B12 absorption and pernicious anemia. $ Educational objective Acute Helicobacter pylori infection initially causes nonatrophic antral gastritis and an increased risk for duodenal ulcers.  Chronic infection results in patchy, multifocal, atrophic gastritis with loss of parietal cells and G cells in the gastric body; this is associated with decreased acid secretion and an increased risk of gastric ulcers, gastric adenocarcinoma, and MALT lymphoma.",

It is an exceedingly common disorder, particularly in Western nations, and its incidence increases with age. $ Diverticulosis may be clinically silent, but up to 30% of patients develop complications, including diverticular bleeding and diverticulitis.  #Diverticular bleeding# occurs with injury to the exposed vasa recta within the colonic lumen and typically presents with #painless# hematochezia.  #Diverticulitis# is caused by trapped food particles or excessive intraluminal pressure within the diverticula, leading to focal necrosis and microperforation.  Patients develop #abdominal pain# (usually in the #left lower quadrant#), fever, nausea and vomiting, and alterations in bowel habits (eg, diarrhea, constipation).  Diverticulitis is typically managed with antibiotics and bowel rest; however, surgery may be required for recurrent disease. $ The risk for diverticular disease is increased by dietary factors, including #diets high in red meat#, high in #fat#, and low in fiber #(choice A)#.  Other risk factors include obesity, physical inactivity, and smoking. $ (Choice B)  Although previously thought to be associated with diverticular diseases, the ingestion of nuts, seeds, and popcorn is not correlated with increased risk of diverticulosis, diverticular bleeding, or diverticulitis. $ (Choice D)  Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with peptic ulcer and gastric cancer but does not increase the risk of diverticular disease. $ (Choice E)  Excessive alcohol intake is associated with liver cirrhosis and squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus; it is not associated with diverticular disease. $ Educational objective Colonic diverticulosis refers to multiple sac-like outpouchings within the sigmoid colon.

Bilirubin supersaturation occurs through the following mechanisms: $ • #Increased bilirubin production:#  Chronic hemolysis, as seen in #sickle cell anemia#, hereditary spherocytosis, and thalassemia, increases circulating levels of free bilirubin, which is taken up by the liver and #excreted into bile#. $ • #Altered enterohepatic circulation# of bilirubin:  Ileal disease (eg, Crohn disease) or resection allows bile acids, which are normally reabsorbed in the ileum, to spill into the colon.

This condition is caused by #gastrin-secreting tumors# (gastrinomas) that are often malignant and usually located in the small intestine or pancreas.  Gastrin causes parietal cell hyperplasia and stimulates gastric acid secretion, resulting in the development of #peptic ulcers#, heartburn, and #diarrhea# (excess gastric acid impairs intestinal epithelial cells and digestive enzymes).  Although most proximal duodenal ulcers are caused by Helicobacter pylori infection or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use #(choice E)#, ulcers found #beyond the duodenal bulb# suggest ZES. $ #Secretin# is a hormone released from the duodenum in response to acid and fat in the small intestine.  The hormone increases pancreatic bicarbonate secretion and inhibits the release of gastrin from normal gastric G cells.  However, secretin paradoxically #stimulates gastrin release from gastrinomas# due to abnormal adenylate cyclase activation.  As such, secretin administration can be used to differentiate ZES from other causes of hypergastrinemia (eg, atrophic gastritis). $ (Choice A)  Autoimmune gastritis (chronic atrophic gastritis) involves the body/fundus of the stomach with antral sparing.  CD4+ T cell-mediated parietal cell destruction causes impaired gastric acid and intrinsic factor secretion, resulting in achlorhydria and pernicious anemia, respectively.  Low acid levels stimulate gastrin release from G cells (hypergastrinemia), but secretin administration causes a reduction in gastrin levels. $ (Choice B)  H pylori infection is associated with chronic antral-predominant gastritis, which may lead to a reduction in somatostatin-producing cells (delta cells).  Lack of inhibition by somatostatin allows for excessive gastrin release, which promotes gastric acid hypersecretion and proximal duodenal ulcer formation.  Secretin administration typically causes a reduction in gastrin levels in these patients. $ (Choice C)  Crohn disease is associated with dysregulation of the mucosal immune response, intestinal epithelial dysfunction, and altered composition of gut flora.  Patients characteristically have linear ulcerations with adjacent normal-appearing mucosa (cobblestone appearance) in the small intestine. $ (Choice F)  Stress-related mucosal disease can occur with severe physiologic stress (eg, shock, head trauma, burns), but the association between psychological stress (eg, working as an air traffic controller) and peptic ulcer formation is controversial.  Nonetheless, neither form of stress would cause distal duodenal ulcers and hypergastrinemia. $ Educational objective Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is caused by gastrinomas located in the small intestine/pancreas and presents with peptic ulcers (especially distal duodenal ulcers), heartburn, and diarrhea.

          "explanation_2": "$This patient has numerous clinical findings characteristic of #liver cirrhosis#.  In patients with cirrhosis, #gynecomastia# arises from #hyperestrinism#, which has a number of contributing factors: $ • Cirrhosis increases adrenal production of estrogen precursors (eg, androstenedione), which are subsequently aromatized to estrogens (eg, estrone) $ • Estrogens induce sex hormone–binding globulin production, which results in increased testosterone binding and a further decrease in the free testosterone/estrogen ratio $ • Impaired estrogen metabolism by the liver results in estrogen accumulation$ Besides gynecomastia, hyperestrinism in patients with cirrhosis can promote the formation of #spider angiomata#.  @Spider angiomata@ are subcutaneous vascular lesions consisting of a central arteriole surrounded by smaller vessels that blanch on compression.  They are most frequently found on the trunk, face, and upper limbs.  Spider angiomata are likely due to #estrogen-induced arteriolar dilation# and are also seen in other hyperestrogenic states (eg, pregnancy).  The number and size of angiomata generally correlate with the severity of liver disease. $ #(Choices A and F)#  Altered mental status and a sweet, sulfurous breath odor (fetor hepaticus) are signs of poor hepatic function and accumulation of metabolic toxins (eg, ammonia, dimethyl sulfide).  In the healthy liver, ammonia is detoxified to urea, which is then excreted in the urine.  In patients with cirrhosis, ammonia accumulates in the blood, resulting in impaired neurotransmission in the CNS and possible brain edema. $ #(Choices B and E)#  Portal hypertension arises from increased hepatic resistance to portal flow at the sinusoids.  This causes increased hydrostatic pressure and dilation of the portosystemic collateral veins in the periumbilical system (@caput medusae@), lower rectum (anorectal varices), and lower esophagus (esophageal varices).  Portal hypertension also leads to ascites and venous congestion of the spleen (splenomegaly). $ (Choice C)  The liver is the primary site of protein synthesis.  Liver cirrhosis can result in decreased albumin production, leading to lower intravascular oncotic pressure with fluid extravasation and pitting edema in the lower extremities (pedal edema). $ Educational objective In patients with cirrhosis, gynecomastia often occurs due to hyperestrinism, which can also promote the formation of spider angiomata.",

          "explanation_2": "Bile is stored and concentrated within the gallbladder and is involved in digestion and absorption of dietary fats and removal of waste products (eg, bilirubin, cholesterol) for excretion in feces.  Gallstones usually occur when one such waste product supersaturates the bile, resulting in precipitation and eventual stone formation. $ In the United States, most gallstones are due to the #supersaturation of cholesterol#, which usually precipitates out of bile with calcium salts and mucin, forming #white or yellow cholesterol stones#, as seen in this patient.  @Cholesterol stone@ formation occurs due to the following: $ • #Increased cholesterol synthesis:#  Hypercholesterolemia, caused by diet, genetics, diabetes mellitus, medications (eg, oral contraceptives), or #obesity# (increased HMG-CoA reductase activity), results in hypersecretion of cholesterol into the bile. $ • #Gallbladder hypomotility:#  Pregnancy, medications (eg, somatostatin), prolonged fasting, parenteral nutrition, and spinal cord injury lead to @gallbladder stasis@, which promotes excessive water resorption from bile and concentration of cholesterol. $ • #Decreased bile acid synthesis# (or recirculation):  Fibrates (eg, fenofibrate) inhibit bile acid synthesis, increasing cholesterol concentration within the bile.  Decreased bile acid resorption at the ileum (eg, due to Crohn disease) also promotes cholesterol concentration. $ Increased calcium or mucin concentration:  Rapid weight loss (eg, gastric bypass) promotes increased calcium and mucin concentrations in the bile, which trap cholesterol crystals and promote stone formation. $ #(Choices A and E)#  Increased enterohepatic cycling of bilirubin occurs with ileal disease (eg, Crohn disease), as the loss of bile acids promotes reabsorption of unconjugated bilirubin.  Increased efflux of bilirubin into bile also occurs with hyperbilirubinemia from chronic hemolysis (eg, sickle cell disease).  Because of high bilirubin concentrations, these mechanisms promote the formation of black @pigment stones@, not cholesterol stones. $ #(Choices B and C)#  Although both decreased bile acid synthesis (eg, due to fibrate medications) and gallbladder hypomotility (eg, due to pregnancy, prolonged fasting, or spinal cord injury) promote the formation of cholesterol gallstones, this patient does not have risk factors for either etiology. $ Educational objective Most gallstones occur due to the supersaturation of cholesterol, which precipitates out of bile with mucin and calcium salts to form white or yellow cholesterol stones.

The colon receives blood from the marginal artery of the colon (artery of Drummond), an anastomotic system of arteries that is in turn supplied by the superior (SMA) and inferior (IMA) mesenteric artery systems.  The distal colon receives blood also from the internal iliac artery. $ In low-flow states, as may be seen in severe hypotension in patients with underlying arterial insufficiency (eg, diabetes, atherosclerotic arterial disease), #nonocclusive ischemia# may occur at the margins of the anastomotic distributions.  These #\"watershed\"# areas are primarily in the left colon at the #splenic flexure# (border between SMA and IMA supply) and #rectosigmoid junction# (border between sigmoid artery and superior rectal artery).  Less commonly, #occlusive ischemia# can also be caused by thromboembolic (eg, hypercoagulable states, atrial fibrillation) or atheroembolic (eg, aortic instrumentation) events. $ Impaired perfusion to the bowel leads to ischemia and necrosis of the intestinal wall.  Complications can include acidosis, sepsis, gangrene, and perforation.  Colonoscopy will reveal pale mucosa and petechial hemorrhages. $ #(Choices A, B, C, and E)#  The ascending colon, cecum, hepatic flexure, and most of the transverse colon are supplied by branches of the SMA.

          "explanation_2": "This patient has @clinical findings@ consistent with alcohol-induced cirrhosis, namely signs of portal hypertension (ascites/caput medusa) and hepatic encephalopathy (asterixis).  Alcohol-associated hepatic injury evolves through the stages of steatosis (reversible), hepatitis (reversible), and cirrhosis (irreversible). $ Laboratory findings in cirrhosis reflect both hepatocellular/biliary injury and loss of hepatic function.  Hepatocyte injury causes a release of intracellular enzymes and an increase in serum transaminases; biliary injury is reflected by increases in alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT).  Although these laboratory studies are indicative of ongoing hepatobiliary injury, they do not provide information on the liver's functional reserve, a key determinant of prognosis in patients with cirrhosis.  Serum albumin levels and prothrombin time (PT) are better indicators of the liver's biosynthetic function, and its ability to transport and metabolize organic anions is reflected by the serum bilirubin level.  Hypoalbuminemia, elevated bilirubin levels, and prolonged PT are signs of inadequate liver function (eg, liver failure) and indicate a poor prognosis in cirrhotic patients.  For this reason, they are included in multiple scoring systems used to assess the severity of liver failure and need for transplantation. $ (Choice A)  A high aspartate aminotransferase (AST) indicates hepatocellular injury and release of intracellular enzymes into the blood.  AST is classically elevated to more than 2 times the level of alanine aminotransferase in alcohol-associated liver disease.  Transaminase elevations do not reflect liver function and do not predict outcomes; these enzymes can be transiently elevated by a number of self-limited processes. $ (Choice B)  Fibrinogen is a coagulation factor and an acute phase protein.  Liver fibrinogen synthesis is increased in response to infection or acute inflammation and diminished in liver failure.  Therefore, low fibrinogen levels would be expected in liver failure. $ (Choice C)  When the alkaline phosphatase is elevated, serum GGT measurements can differentiate whether the cause is biliary disease or an alternate cause such as bone disease.  GGT elevations are more specific for biliary injury. $ (Choice D)  The bleeding time is a measure of platelet function (not liver synthetic function) and is often prolonged in severe alcohol-related liver disease, although with a fair degree of variance.  Thrombocytopenia develops with chronic alcohol use due to both direct toxic effects of alcohol on the bone marrow as well as splenic sequestration of platelets. $ Educational objective Increased aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase are indicators of hepatocellular damage, and increased alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase indicate biliary injury.  Serum albumin levels, bilirubin levels, and prothrombin time are reflective of liver function and are of greatest prognostic significance in patients with cirrhosis.",

Hypertrophy of the circular layer of @smooth muscle@ that surrounds the pylorus obstructs the gastric outlet and impedes the passage of gastric contents, resulting in nonbilious, projectile emesis.  Vomiting usually occurs immediately after oral intake, and infants classically show signs of hunger soon after emesis.  The etiology of this abnormal postnatal #growth of smooth muscle# is likely multifactorial, involving the interplay of genetic factors (eg, positive family history) with environmental exposures (eg, macrolide antibiotics). $ If the diagnosis is delayed, protracted vomiting can result in hypochloremic #metabolic alkalosis# because of the  loss of hydrochloric acid in the emesis.  In addition, hypovolemia activates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and aldosterone stimulates potassium excretion by the kidneys, resulting in hypokalemia.  #Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia# is also commonly seen due to dehydration, which increases enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin. $ Examination of patients with infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis often reveals palpation of the hypertrophied muscle as an #olive-shaped abdominal mass# in the epigastrium, although its absence does not exclude the diagnosis.  Visually #prominent peristaltic waves# may be seen and represent exaggerated gastric contractions attempting to move food beyond the obstruction.  A thick, elongated pylorus visualized with abdominal ultrasonography is diagnostic, and pyloromyotomy is the definitive treatment. $ (Choice B)  Midgut malrotation is a defect in the normal rotation of the midgut around the superior mesenteric artery in early gestation and can lead to volvulus of the small intestine.  Although vomiting commonly occurs, the emesis is typically bilious, and infants are usually ill-appearing and hemodynamically unstable. $ #(Choices C and E)#  Biliary cysts and biliary atresia (fibrous obliteration of the extrahepatic bile ducts) cause jaundice due to direct (conjugated) hyperbilirubinemia, which is not present in this patient.  Moreover, these conditions do not typically cause vomiting. $ (Choice D)  Intestinal atresia is caused by disruption of mesenteric blood vessels during embryologic development, leading to ischemic necrosis and resorption of the fetal bowel.  Vomiting is a common presenting symptom, but it occurs within 48 hours of birth and the emesis is bilious. $ Educational objective Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis is characterized by smooth muscle overgrowth of the pylorus.

CEA levels are also higher in smokers than nonsmokers. $ (Choice A)  Surgical resection is recommended for most patients with colon cancer unless there are unresectable metastases.  The specific procedure recommended is dependent on stage and anatomical considerations rather than CEA levels. $ (Choice B)  Adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended for most patients with node-positive colorectal adenocarcinoma regardless of CEA levels. $ #(Choices C and E)#  Tumor grade describes the degree of tumor differentiation and is determined histologically.  The stage of the tumor reflects the extent of its spread (eg, penetration of the bowel wall, lymph node invasion, distant metastases).  Elevated CEA levels are associated with a worse prognosis regardless of tumor stage, but CEA measurement is not currently considered part of the initial staging evaluation. $ Educational objective Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels are increased in colon cancer but are also elevated in a number of other conditions (eg, pancreatic cancer, COPD, cirrhosis).  CEA cannot be used to diagnose colon cancer, but it is helpful for detecting residual disease and recurrence."

In contrast to the time-intensive task of culturing the bacteria, the rapid urease test can be used to quickly diagnose an active infection. $ The rapid urease test is an indirect test for H pylori based on bacterial production of the enzyme #urease#, which splits gastric #urea into ammonia# and CO2.  In vivo, this process increases local pH and facilitates bacterial survival in the acidic stomach environment.  During the test, biopsy specimens are exposed to a solution containing urea and a pH indicator such as phenol red, which changes color from yellow to pink at alkaline pH.  A color change indicates the presence of bacterial urease and confirms active H pylori infection. $ (Choice A)  Gastric adenocarcinoma (ie, clonal proliferation of glandular cells) can present as a gastric ulcer; therefore, gastric ulcers should be biopsied to rule out malignancy.  However, specimens from malignant ulcers do not cause a color change on rapid urease testing. $ (Choice B)  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (eg, aspirin, ibuprofen) are another common cause of peptic ulcers due to their inhibition of the enzyme cyclooxygenase, which is responsible for the synthesis of gastroprotective prostaglandins.  However, urease would not be present in an NSAID-induced ulcer. $ (Choice D)  In Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, gastrin hypersecretion leads to overproduction of gastric acid and formation of peptic ulcers.  In the human body, H pylori also appears to induce acid production (eg, gastrin hypersecretion); however, the urease test detects bacterial urease, which causes the color change (ie, pH rise is from ammonia generation). $ (Choice E)  Autoimmune gastritis is due to T-cell–mediated destruction of parietal cells.  Patients are typically asymptomatic, but prolonged disease leads to pernicious anemia (B12 deficiency due to intrinsic factor destruction) characterized by megaloblastic anemia and neurologic dysfunction.  Gastric pH is increased due to loss of parietal cells, but ulcers do not occur in this condition, and the urease test would be negative. $ Educational objective Helicobacter pylori produces the enzyme urease, which splits urea into CO2 and ammonia and neutralizes the local acidic gastric pH.

          "explanation_2": "This patient's #acute pancreatitis# is likely related to #chronic alcohol use# given his #>2 AST:ALT ratio# and #absence of gallstones# on abdominal ultrasound.  After gallstones, alcohol use is the second most common cause of acute pancreatitis.  Ethanol induces pancreatic secretions with a high protein concentration and low fluid content.  These viscous secretions are prone to precipitate and form plugs that can obstruct the lumina of the pancreatic ductules.  Alcohol also causes spasms of the sphincter of Oddi and has a direct toxic effect on the acinar cells. $ Alcohol-related acute pancreatitis is clinically #indistinguishable# from pancreatitis due to other causes.  However, chronic alcohol use causes a number of systemic effects due to both the direct toxic actions of ethanol and alcohol-associated vitamin deficiencies.  Even in the absence of anemia, #macrocytosis# (mean corpuscular volume >100 fL) is often seen and is likely related to poor nutrition (eg, folate deficiency), liver disease, and/or direct toxicity of alcohol on the marrow. $ (Choice B)  In severe acute pancreatitis, necrosis can spread into the retroperitoneal fat, omentum, mesentery, and even beyond the abdominal cavity.  Large amounts of calcium bind to the released free fatty acids, forming soaps that are deposited in the areas of necrosis, which may result in hypocalcemia.  However, this is a nonspecific finding that can occur with pancreatitis of any etiology, not just alcohol-related pancreatitis. $ (Choice C)  Inflammation in acute pancreatitis may lead to dysfunction of the pancreatic islets with decreased secretion of insulin, resulting in hyperglycemia.  This is a nonspecific finding that can occur with pancreatitis of any etiology, not just alcohol-related pancreatitis. $ (Choice D)  Hypernatremia may occur in the setting of severe acute pancreatitis due to large third-space fluid loss (ie, interstitial fluid accumulation) and decreased water intake, causing subsequent hypovolemia and renal sodium retention.  This finding is also not specific for alcohol-related pancreatitis. $ (Choice E)  An increased white blood cell count is a nonspecific marker of inflammation and may occur with pancreatitis of any etiology. $ Educational objective After gallstones, chronic alcohol use is the second most common cause of acute pancreatitis.  Macrocytosis and an AST:ALT ratio >2 are indirect indicators of chronic alcohol consumption.  Alcohol-related macrocytosis can occur independently of folate deficiency."

Additional risk factors include exclusive breastfeeding, due to the low vitamin K content of breast milk, and #cystic fibrosis# (CF), due to malabsorption of #fat-soluble vitamins# (A, D, E, K). $ Vitamin K is an essential cofactor for #gamma-glutamyl carboxylase#, an enzyme that carboxylates #coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X#.  Carboxylation allows for the creation of calcium-binding sites, which attract clotting factors to negatively charged phospholipids on platelets and endothelial cells, which is necessary for efficient coagulation.  Vitamin K deficiency leads to impaired clotting factor activity. $ Newborns who do not receive routine #vitamin K prophylaxis# at birth are at greatest risk for vitamin K–deficient bleeding.  Lack of functioning coagulation factors predisposes to #life-threatening bleeding#, such as #intracranial hemorrhage# and profuse bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract, umbilicus, and surgical sites. $ (Choice A)  Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) deficiency results in defective collagen synthesis due to failure of hydroxylation of proline and lysine.  Mucosal bleeding and skin bruising are typical and occur in severely malnourished individuals and those who misuse drugs or alcohol.  Breast milk provides adequate ascorbic acid. $ (Choice B)  Vitamin B3 (niacin) deficiency results in failure of formation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), which are required for fatty-acid oxidation and synthesis, respectively.  Niacin deficiency presents with pellagra (ie, dermatitis, diarrhea, dementia), not intracranial hemorrhage. $ #(Choices C and F)#  Patients with CF are at risk for deficiency of vitamins A and D.

Symptoms of pancreatic malignancy vary with location; tumors at the pancreatic head typically produce obstructive symptoms due to compression of the common bile duct (CBD), whereas those in the body and tail do not obstruct the CBD and often produce midepigastric pain due to invasion of the splanchnic plexus. $ #Smoking# is the most important environmental risk factor for pancreatic cancer and doubles the risk. $ (Choice A)  Alcohol consumption increases the risk of malignant tumors involving the head, neck, esophagus, and liver.  Chronic alcohol consumption can cause chronic pancreatitis, but moderate alcohol use in the absence of chronic pancreatitis does not appear to confer any additional risk for pancreatic cancer. $ (Choice C)  Chronic, heavy intake of hot beverages is associated with increased risk for esophageal cancer, but coffee intake does not increase the risk of pancreatic cancer. $#(Choices D and E)#  A low-fiber diet and diets high in processed meats are associated with an increased risk of colon adenocarcinoma. $ (Choice F)  Chronic viral hepatitis B and C greatly increase the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma.

These findings occur due to #accumulation of lipids# in the absorptive cells of the intestinal epithelium and are typical of #abetalipoproteinemia#, a disease caused by impaired formation of apolipoprotein B (apoB)-containing lipoproteins. $ Dietary lipids are normally processed in small-bowel enterocytes and secreted as chylomicrons; endogenously produced lipids are secreted from hepatocytes as very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL).  Chylomicron and VLDL particles are synthesized within the endoplasmic reticulum as lipids accumulate around apolipoprotein B (ApoB).  ApoB-100 is found in VLDL, and apoB-48 (a truncated version without the LDL receptor ligand) is present in chylomicrons.  During the synthesis of apoB-containing lipoproteins, #microsomal triglyceride transfer protein# (MTP) functions as a chaperone protein necessary for proper folding of apoB and also participates in the transfer of lipids to newly formed chylomicrons and VLDL particles. $ Abetalipoproteinemia is most commonly caused by an autosomal recessive, #loss-of-function mutation#in the #MTP gene#.

The most common obstructing agents are fecaliths, hyperplastic lymphoid follicles (eg, following infection), tumors (eg, carcinoid), and nematodes. $ Mucus accumulates in the lumen of the obstructed appendix, which causes #increased pressure#, appendiceal wall distension, and impaired venous outflow.  The resulting #ischemia# and associated #bacterial proliferation (choice B)# lead to #inflammation# of the appendiceal wall, causing edema (with further distension), serosal #erythema#, and purulent #exudate#.  Necrosis of the wall with rupture may follow, and inflammatory fluid and bacterial contents may spill into the peritoneal cavity, causing peritonitis. $ Patients typically experience #abdominal pain#, which may migrate over time.  Distension of the appendix triggers afferent pain fibers that enter at the T10 level in the spinal cord, producing vague, referred pain at the #umbilicus#.  As the inflammatory reaction advances, the appendix irritates the parietal peritoneum, causing more severe somatic pain that #shifts# to the #right lower quadrant#. $ #(Choices A and E)#  Both arterial spasm and venous thrombosis can cause mesenteric ischemia, which often presents with severe, diffuse abdominal pain.  Gross examination of the affected bowel segment would show dusky red serosa, edema, and hemorrhagic mucosa. $ (Choice D)  Meckel diverticula often contain ectopic gastric mucosa, which may lead to peptic ulceration of the surrounding small intestinal tissue and subsequent lower intestinal bleeding.

Patients on fibrate therapy should also be monitored for myopathy, a risk significantly increased when fibrates are used concurrently with statins. $#(Choice A)#  Long-term use of statins (eg, atorvastatin) is associated with decreased risk of gallstone disease as inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase reduces cholesterol biosynthesis and bile supersaturation.  Side effects of statin therapy include hepatic dysfunction (elevated aminotransferases) and myopathy. $#(Choice B)#  Ezetimibe blocks intestinal cholesterol absorption, decreasing liver cholesterol stores and reducing biliary cholesterol content.  Adverse effects associated with ezetimibe include elevated transaminases (increased with concurrent use of statins) and diarrhea. $#(Choice C)#  Fish oil supplements containing high concentrations of omega-3 fatty acids increase bile acid synthesis, decrease cholesterol saturation in bile, and increase gallbladder motility.  The net effect is a decreased risk of gallstone formation. $#(Choice E)#  Niacin increases HDL (via reduced catabolism) and lowers triglyceride levels (through inhibition of VLDL secretion).  It is associated with lower rates of gallstone disease.  Niacin commonly promotes flushing, a temporary prostaglandin-mediated effect often blunted by use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. $#Educational objective# Gemfibrozil (and other fibrates) can reduce cholesterol solubility and promote gallstone formation by reducing bile acid synthesis.  Caution should be used when prescribing fibrate therapy to patients with underlying gallbladder disease.  "

  "explanation_2": "#Achalasia# is an esophageal motility disorder characterized by the absence of esophageal peristalsis in the distal esophagus and incomplete relaxation of a #hypertonic lower esophageal sphincter# (LES).  Achalasia is caused by the immune-mediated #destruction of inhibitory ganglion cells# in the esophageal wall.  Nitric oxide–producing neurons in the myenteric plexus that are responsible for esophageal smooth muscle relaxation are preferentially destroyed, whereas excitatory cholinergic neurons responsible for smooth muscle contraction are relatively spared.  This imbalance results in increased lower esophageal tone and impaired sphincter relaxation. $@Botulinum toxin@, a neurotoxin formed by Clostridium botulinum, prevents the fusion of acetylcholine-containing synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane.  This effectively prevents acetylcholine release into the neuromuscular synapse, resulting in muscle weakness and paralysis.  In a patient with achalasia, injection of #botulinum toxin# into the LES causes #cholinergic blockade#, leading to sphincter relaxation and symptomatic improvement. $#(Choices B and D)#  In addition to the cholinergic neurons, there are multiple other hormones and neurotransmitters that modulate esophageal tone.  Prostaglandins promote LES relaxation, whereas alpha-adrenergic agonists, such as phenylephrine, increase LES tone.  Because corticosteroids inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, both corticosteroids and phenylephrine would worsen the patient's symptoms. $#(Choices C and E)#  Neostigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor and pilocarpine is a cholinergic agonist.  Both of these medications increase cholinergic stimuli at the LES and would worsen the patient's symptoms. $#Educational objective# Achalasia is caused by loss of inhibitory ganglion cells in the distal esophageal wall and is characterized by the absence of esophageal peristalsis and incomplete relaxation of a hypertonic lower esophageal sphincter.

TD can be caused by a variety of organisms, including bacteria (eg, Escherichia coli), viruses (eg, rotaviruses), or occasionally, parasites (eg, Cryptosporidium parvum).  In most cases, the illness is self-limited and treatment is symptomatic. $The choice of antiemetic therapy depends on the source of the emetogenic stimulus.  Conditions that cause #gastrointestinal irritation# (eg, infections, chemotherapy, distention) result in increased mucosal #serotonin# release and activation of 5-HT3 receptors on vagal and spinal afferent nerves.  These then relay their impulses to the medullary vomiting center, inducing emesis.  #5-HT3 receptor antagonists# (eg, ondansetron) are well-tolerated medications that are very effective at reducing nausea and vomiting caused by gastrointestinal upset. $#(Choice B)#  Loperamide is a µ-opioid receptor agonist that functions as an antimotility agent.  It is commonly used in TD to reduce diarrhea but can worsen nausea and vomiting due to colonic retention. $#(Choice C)#  Dopamine receptor antagonists (eg, metoclopramide, prochlorperazine) are effective in treating central nausea (seen in acute migraines) and also reduce migraine headache pain.

Promethazine is a dopamine and H1 receptor antagonist that can also treat vestibular nausea.  All of these medications can cause significant sedation. $#(Choice E)#  H2 blockers (eg, famotidine) reduce gastric acid secretion and can alleviate symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux but do not treat nausea and vomiting. $#(Choice G)#  Somatostatin receptor agonists (eg, octreotide) inhibit bioactive amine release and are used to treat diarrhea in patients with carcinoid syndrome and vasoactive intestinal peptide-secreting tumors (ie, VIPoma).  They are also used for treatment of acute esophageal variceal hemorrhage. $#Educational objective# 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are useful for the treatment of visceral nausea due to gastrointestinal insults, such as gastroenteritis, chemotherapy, and general anesthesia.  Antihistamines and anticholinergics are recommended for vestibular nausea.  Dopamine antagonists are useful for nausea associated with migraine.  "

Excess ammonia is shunted past the liver and crosses the blood-brain barrier, leading to #altered mental status# (thought due to impaired neurotransmitter release, astrocyte dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and/or edema).  Asterixis, the rhythmic flapping of dorsiflexed hands, is another common manifestation of HE. $A primary source of ammonia is degradation of nitrogen products by intestinal bacteria.  Therefore, #gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding# can precipitate HE as hemoglobin breakdown leads to increased nitrogen products in the gut.  #Excess dietary protein intake# (eg, large steak meal) is another common trigger.  Others include infection, sedatives, and metabolic derangements (eg, hypokalemia). $#Rifaximin# is a nonabsorbable antibiotic that alters GI flora to decrease intestinal production and absorption of ammonia.  In patients with HE, rifaximin is generally used in addition to #lactulose#, which is catabolized by intestinal bacterial flora to short chain fatty acids, lowering the colonic pH and increasing conversion of ammonia to ammonium #(choice E).#  Rifaximin is also sometimes used for traveler's diarrhea, as it inhibits bacterial RNA synthesis through binding with DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. $#(Choices A and C)#  Phosphate binders (eg, calcium acetate) lower serum phosphate in patients with end-stage renal disease.  Sodium polystyrene resin (eg, sodium polystyrene sulfonate) exchanges intraluminal sodium for potassium ions and can lower serum potassium in patients with hyperkalemia.  However, neither effectively treats HE. $#(Choice D)#  Bile acid sequestrants (cholestyramine, colestipol) bind intestinal bile acids to lower serum cholesterol, but they are not used for treating HE. $#Educational objective# Treatments for hepatic encephalopathy include lactulose (increases conversion of ammonia to ammonium) and rifaximin (decreases intraluminal ammonia production).

Bile acids are primarily absorbed in the terminal ileum, with the small amount that remains unabsorbed being excreted in the stool (this amount is matched by bile acid synthesis). $#Statins# are the first-line therapy for most patients with hypercholesterolemia.  These drugs competitively #inhibit HMG CoA reductase#, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of HMG CoA to mevalonate (ie, the rate-limiting step in hepatic cholesterol synthesis).  This inhibition #decreases hepatic cholesterol synthesis#.  The resulting upregulation of LDL receptors causes increased uptake of LDL from the circulation.  Statins are very effective in reducing LDL cholesterol.  Statins' effects on triglyceride and HDL levels are comparatively modest. $#Bile acid–binding resins# (ie, bile acid sequestrants) work by binding bile acids in the gastrointestinal tract, thereby interfering with the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids and causing increased bile acid excretion.  This results in hepatic #synthesis of new bile acids#, a process that consumes liver cholesterol stores.  Hepatic uptake of LDL from the circulation is increased for continued bile acid synthesis.  Bile acid production and secretion are increased by 10-fold due to this interruption of the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids.  Hepatic cholesterol reduction is an activating factor for HMG CoA reductase and subsequently results in #increased hepatic cholesterol synthesis#.  This effect can be blocked with the addition of a statin drug to the treatment regimen, leading to a greater reduction in LDL levels than with use of either drug alone (synergistic action). $#Educational objective# Simvastatin decreases hepatic cholesterol production, while cholestyramine increases hepatic cholesterol and bile acid synthesis.

They inhibit gastric acid secretion by targeting histamine receptors on parietal cells.  These medications are less side effect–prone than PPIs; however, they have a slower onset of action, and tachyphylaxis is common. $#(Choice A)#  Gastrin, a hormone released from G cells, binds to cholecystokinin (CCK) B receptors and stimulates gastric acid secretion both directly (through binding on parietal cells) and indirectly (through binding on enterochromaffin-like cells to increase histamine release).  CCK receptor antagonists are not routinely used in clinical practice. $#(Choice B)#  Sucralfate forms a viscous paste in the stomach, providing a cytoprotective layer that prevents the diffusion of gastric acid.  It is less effective than PPIs and is typically used as an adjunctive medication for peptic ulcer disease. $#(Choice D)#  Octreotide is a somatostatin analogue that inhibits gastrin synthesis (as well as many other gastrointestinal hormones).  It is sometimes used in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, but is not routinely used for GERD. $#(Choice E)#  Misoprostol is a prostaglandin E1 analogue that binds prostaglandin receptors on parietal cells, reducing gastric acid production and inducing secretion of mucus and bicarbonate.  Misoprostol can be used to prevent NSAID–induced gastric ulcers, but is less helpful for treating GERD; its significant uterotonic effects (eg, uterine contractions, cervical ripening) also limit its use in women of childbearing age. $#Educational objective# Management of gastroesophageal reflux disease includes lifestyle and dietary modifications (eg, weight loss, tobacco avoidance) and medications such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) (eg, pantoprazole, omeprazole) or histamine 2 receptor antagonists (eg, famotidine).

His heavy alcohol use and evidence of chronic liver disease (eg, spider angiomas, thrombocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia, elevated PT) suggest the ascites developed due to #alcohol-associated cirrhosis#. $In cirrhosis, portal hypertension leads to splanchnic vasodilation, which decreases the effective arterial volume and lowers the systemic blood pressure.  Renal perfusion is reduced, leading to activation of the @#renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system# (RAAS),@ which promotes vasoconstriction (due to angiotensin) and fluid and sodium retention by the kidneys (due to aldosterone).  Although this improves systemic blood pressure and renal perfusion, due to the altered hemodynamics in patients with cirrhosis (eg, elevated hydrostatic pressure due to portal hypertension, low oncotic pressure due to hypoalbuminemia) it ultimately results in third spacing of fluid with edema and ascites. $#Spironolactone#, an #aldosterone antagonist#, is used to interrupt this cycle.  It induces natriuresis without blocking the critical vasoconstrictive effects of angiotensin.  Spironolactone is typically used with furosemide (a loop diuretic) to increase the efficacy of natriuresis and prevent electrolyte disturbances. $#(Choices B and C)#  Patients with cirrhosis have low mean arterial pressure due to splanchnic vasodilation and are dependent on the RAAS to help normalize blood pressure and renal perfusion.  ACE inhibitors (eg, lisinopril) and angiotensin receptor blockers blunt this critical response and promote organ hypoperfusion.  Likewise, blockade of alpha-adrenergic receptors would cause widespread vasodilation with decreased systemic blood pressure, worsening renal perfusion and causing additional fluid accumulation. $#(Choice D)#  Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) levels are increased in cirrhosis, which contributes to the development of hypervolemic hyponatremia.  Although ADH inhibitors (eg, tolvaptan) have been used to treat severe hyponatremia in cirrhosis, they are not indicated in patients with normal sodium levels. $#(Choice E)#  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs inhibit prostaglandin production, which can cause renal vasoconstriction and may precipitate gastrointestinal bleeding.  These medications should be avoided in patients with cirrhosis due to impaired renal perfusion at baseline and high risk of variceal bleeding. $#Educational objective# Ascites in cirrhosis develops from hemodynamic changes related to portal hypertension.  Splanchnic vasodilation decreases the systemic vascular resistance, which causes activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and promotes vasoconstriction and sodium and water retention.

It does not cross the blood-brain barrier; therefore, it #does not induce# opiate-related #withdrawal symptoms#, allowing for treatment of OIC without disrupting analgesic effects. $#(Choices A and B)#  Diphenoxylate and loperamide are both opiate-based medications designed to inhibit peristalsis in the gastrointestinal tract.  These medications are used to treat diarrhea and would worsen this patient's constipation. $#(Choice C)#  Lubiprostone is a chloride channel agonist that increases intestinal secretions.  Although it is not a µ-opioid receptor antagonist, it can be used to treat OIC and would not put patients at risk for opiate-related withdrawal. $#(Choice E)#  Naloxone is also an opioid receptor antagonist; however, unlike methylnaltrexone, naloxone crosses the blood-brain barrier.  It induces symptoms of withdrawal and reversal of analgesia and is used to treat acute opioid toxicity (eg, respiratory depression, somnolence). $#Educational objective# Constipation is the most common side effect of opiate therapy and occurs due to the binding of µ-opioid receptors in the gastrointestinal tract, which decreases intestinal motility and inhibits ion and fluid secretion.  Methylnaltrexone, a peripherally acting µ-opioid receptor antagonist that does not cross the blood-brain barrier, can alleviate opioid-induced constipation without inducing opiate-related withdrawal symptoms.

  "explanation_2": "#Constipation# is an exceedingly common gastrointestinal condition with a wide variety of underlying etiologies (eg, autonomic neuropathy, hypothyroidism, electrolyte abnormalities).  In this patient who developed constipation after new-onset atrial fibrillation, the most likely etiology is a #drug effect# related to diltiazem. $Diltiazem and verapamil are #non–dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers# that decrease conduction velocity in the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes and are often used in the management of atrial fibrillation.  Constipation, a common adverse effect, occurs due to inhibition of the colonic migrating motor complex, resulting in #slowed contractions of colonic smooth muscle#.  This is not typically seen with dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, amlodipine, nifedipine). $Other common medications that cause constipation include opiates, serotonin 5-HT3 antagonists (eg, ondansetron), iron tablets, aluminum-containing agents (eg, antacids), and medications with anticholinergic properties (eg, diphenhydramine, tricyclic antidepressants, first-generation antipsychotics). $#(Choice A)#  Alterations in the colonic microbiome are common after antibiotic therapy but typically cause diarrhea (eg, Clostridioides [formerly Clostridium] difficile colitis), not constipation. $#(Choice B)#  The gastrocolic reflex is a neurogenic reflex triggered by gastric distension from food, leading to colonic contractions; impairment of the reflex can cause constipation.  However, this typically occurs in patients with diabetic neuropathy and gastroparesis. $#(Choice C)#  Inappropriate contraction of pelvic floor muscles occurs with dyssynergic defecation, preventing the expulsion of stool from the rectum.  Dyssynergic defecation is more common in the elderly and often associated with neurologic disorders (eg, Parkinson disease) or trauma.  The development of symptoms after this patient started diltiazem is more consistent with medication-induced constipation. $#(Choice E)#  A rectocele, which occurs when the rectum prolapses into the posterior vaginal wall, usually develops in elderly, multiparous women.  Although constipation is common, patients usually describe pelvic pressure and the need to manually push on the vagina or rectum to defecate. $#(Choice F)#  Sigmoid volvulus typically presents with progressive abdominal pain, nausea, and constipation and eventually results in bowel obstruction (eg, failure to pass gas, obstipation, possible perforation).  Symptoms occur over the course of days, not months. $#Educational objective# Constipation is a common adverse effect of non–dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, diltiazem, verapamil).

Because he is able to tolerate intake by mouth (ie, no severe nausea or ongoing vomiting), an #oral rehydration solution# (ORS), such as Pedialyte, is an appropriate treatment.  Acute diarrhea causes loss of total body water and electrolytes, which places patients at risk for several complications: $• #Hypovolemia# is due to intestinal loss of #sodium#, the major extracellular osmole that maintains circulating volume status.  Sodium is @absorbed@ at the gut brush border by 1:1 #cotransport with glucose# via sodium-glucose luminal cotransporter-1 (SGLT-1) lining the apical surface of enterocytes.  Therefore, all ORSs contain sodium and dextrose (ie, D-glucose) in #equimolar amounts#. $• #Metabolic acidosis# (with normal anion gap) is due to loss of bicarbonate in diarrheal secretions.  ORSs typically contain #citrate#, which is metabolized to bicarbonate in the liver, providing a buffering capacity to help correct the acidosis #(choice A).# $• #Hypokalemia# is due to loss of potassium-rich diarrheal secretions.  ORSs typically contain a modest amount of potassium, quickly absorbed by passive diffusion in the small intestine. $Solutions such as fruit juices that have high sugar content (eg, glucose ≥50 g/L) are generally avoided because they may induce a superimposed osmotic diarrhea.  The total osmolality of ORSs is designed to be roughly isotonic to the gut lumen #(choice B).# $#(Choice D)#  Dextrose is provided at 5% (eg, D5W) for intravenous fluids to prevent osmotic swelling and hemolysis of red blood cells, which would occur with true free water.  However, enterocytes are already bathed in a rich mucous layer containing osmoles; they do not lyse even when drinking pure water. $#(Choice E)#  Because the concentration of dextrose in ORSs is limited, they provide only a trivial caloric content (eg, 75 kcal/L).  Caloric deprivation is well tolerated during acute illnesses such as gastroenteritis; patients can safely fast for several days.  However, hydration and intravascular volume status must be maintained. $#Educational objective# Oral rehydration solutions contain equimolar amounts of dextrose (glucose) and sodium, which are absorbed through intestinal cotransport to maintain intravascular volume status.

Combining multiple alkalinizing agents would not minimize their effects on other drugs. $#(Choice C)#  Rebound acid hypersecretion can occur with calcium carbonate, magnesium hydroxide, aluminum hydroxide, and proton pump inhibitors.

These findings, along with a family history of early sibling death from pulmonary infection, suggest a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.  Steatorrhea and failure to thrive occur as a result of malabsorption due to obstructive fibrosis and progressive insufficiency of the exocrine pancreas.  Pancreatic lipase supplementation is likely to improve this patient's condition by enhancing macronutrient and vitamin absorption. $#(Choice A)#  Agents that decrease gastrointestinal motility (eg, opiates such as loperamide) can help decrease the volume of diarrhea by slowing intestinal transit time and allowing greater net fluid resorption.  However, antimotility agents would not improve the deficiencies in nutrient absorption. $#(Choice B)#  A gluten-free diet is the mainstay of treatment for celiac sprue but would be unlikely to help this patient's malabsorption. $#(Choice C)#  Metronidazole is effective only for diarrhea due to infectious causes (eg, giardiasis).  This patient's diarrhea is more likely due to malabsorption secondary to cystic fibrosis. $#(Choice D)#  Octreotide is a somatostatin analogue that decreases gut motility, blood flow, and endocrine and exocrine pancreatic function.  Octreotide decreases secretion of pancreatic enzymes into the intestine and could therefore aggravate this patient's malabsorptive diarrhea and associated nutritional deficiencies. $#(Choice F)#  5-aminosalicylates (eg, sulfasalazine, mesalamine) are used to treat inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.  They work by inhibiting cytokine, prostaglandin, and leukotriene synthesis during inflammation.  This patient's diarrhea and weight loss are not caused by inflammation. $#Educational objective# In a young Caucasian patient, the combination of recurrent respiratory infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, diarrhea, and failure to thrive suggests a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.  Cystic fibrosis causes steatorrhea and failure to thrive due to malabsorption secondary to pancreatic insufficiency, which can be corrected by pancreatic enzyme supplementation.  "

Therefore, common adverse effects of PPIs include malabsorption of calcium, iron, magnesium, and vitamin B12 #(choices B, D, and E)#. $Patients with #pancreatic insufficiency# (eg, cystic fibrosis, chronic pancreatitis) cannot synthesize the pancreatic enzymes required for digestion of protein, fat, and carbohydrates.

  "explanation_2": "$Deglutition (swallowing) is a complex process that involves 3 phases:  $1. In the voluntary oral phase, the food bolus is collected in the back of the mouth and lifted upward to the posterior wall of the pharynx.  $2. This initiates the pharyngeal phase, which consists of involuntary pharyngeal muscle contractions that propel the food bolus to the esophagus.  $3. During the esophageal phase, food stretches the walls of the esophagus, stimulating peristalsis just above the site of distension and moving the food downward.  Relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) follows, allowing the food bolus to enter the stomach. $Abnormal spasm or diminished relaxation of the cricopharyngeal muscles during swallowing (#cricopharyngeal motor dysfunction#) is thought to be the underlying mechanism of @Zenker diverticulum@ formation.  This process results in early #oropharyngeal dysphagia# with a feeling of food obstruction at the level of the neck and coughing/choking.  Increased oropharyngeal intraluminal pressure eventually results in herniation of the pharyngeal mucosa through a zone of muscle weakness (@false diverticulum@) in the posterior hypopharynx (Killian triangle).  Patients consequently develop food retention with #halitosis/regurgitation#.  #Pulmonary aspiration# of diverticular contents may also lead to recurrent pneumonia.  As the diverticulum enlarges, it may become palpable as a lateral neck mass, and dysphagia can worsen due to luminal narrowing caused by extrinsic esophageal compression. $#(Choice B)#  Degenerative changes of the myenteric plexus with impaired LES relaxation result in achalasia.  Barium swallow typically shows esophageal dilation with esophagogastric junction narrowing (@\"bird's beak\"@). $#(Choice C)#  Mucosal tears around the gastroesophageal junction can be caused by increased intraluminal pressure in the stomach during prolonged or recurrent retching/vomiting (Mallory-Weiss syndrome). $#(Choice D)#  Retention cysts form due to accumulation of trapped secretions following obstruction of a gland's duct.  Chronic rhinosinusitis frequently causes mucus retention cysts in the maxillary sinus. $#(Choice E)#  Mediastinal lymphadenitis (eg, due to tuberculosis, fungal infections) can cause scarring/traction of the mid-portion of the esophagus, resulting in the formation of true diverticula (containing all gut wall layers). $#Educational objective# Diminished relaxation of cricopharyngeal muscles during swallowing results in increased intraluminal pressure in the oropharynx.  This may eventually cause the mucosa to herniate through a zone of muscle weakness in the posterior hypopharynx, forming a Zenker (false) diverticulum, which presents in elderly patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia, halitosis, regurgitation, and recurrent aspiration.

Gliadin, a component of gluten, is responsible for triggering the T-cell–mediated reaction against the small-bowel mucosa seen in celiac disease.  This is initially characterized by intraepithelial lymphocytosis, followed as the disease progresses by a #loss of small-bowel intestinal villi# and #mucosal atrophy#.  This decreases the nutritional absorptive capabilities of the small bowel, particularly in the duodenum and proximal jejunum. $Because iron is absorbed primarily in the duodenum, #iron deficiency# leading to #microcytic anemia# is a common manifestation of celiac disease; common presenting features include fatigue and pale mucosa.  Other symptoms of gluten-sensitive enteropathy include #postprandial diarrhea# and steatorrhea (eg, pale, loose stools), #abdominal cramps#, bloating, flatulence, and weight loss.  Celiac disease is not associated with elevated systemic inflammatory markers (eg, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate), and unlike gastrointestinal disorders that cause chronic blood loss (eg, inflammatory bowel disease, colon cancer), in celiac disease, fecal occult blood testing is negative. $#(Choice B)#  Pernicious anemia is characterized by antibody-mediated destruction of intrinsic factor and gastric parietal cells.  This can lead to decreased @vitamin B12 absorption@, with macrocytic (not microcytic) anemia, glossitis, and, sometimes, subacute combined degeneration of the dorsolateral spinal cord. $#(Choice C)#  @Ulcerative colitis@ causes chronic inflammatory changes of the colonic mucosa and submucosa.  Iron deficiency anemia is common but is due to blood loss rather than malabsorption; a positive fecal occult blood test would be expected, and inflammatory markers are typically elevated. $#(Choice D)#  Giardiasis is usually diagnosed on stool testing, although Giardia lamblia@ trophozoites@ are readily visible on small-bowel biopsy.  Giardiasis is a common cause of diarrhea and may cause steatorrhea due to impairment of brush border enzymes.  However, iron malabsorption with microcytic anemia is uncommon. $#(Choice E)#  @Collagenous colitis@ is characterized by subepithelial collagen deposition in the colon.  It often causes watery diarrhea but does not affect iron absorption in the small intestine, so microcytic anemia would be unexpected. $#Educational objective# Celiac disease is an immune-mediated disorder triggered by dietary gluten that causes small-bowel malabsorption.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient with Crohn disease most likely developed gallstones due to inflammation of the terminal ileum causing decreased bile acid reabsorption. $#Bile acids# are produced in the liver and excreted with bile into the duodenum.  There, they #emulsify fat droplets# to form water-soluble micelles that allow pancreatic lipase to efficiently hydrolyze triglycerides into fatty acids and monoglycerides.  In the jejunum, these micelles come in close contact with the gut epithelium, which facilitates the passive absorption of fatty acids, monoglycerides, and cholesterol across the brush border into enterocytes.  However, bile acids are ionized molecules that cannot passively cross the intestinal wall.  The bile acids eventually reach the #terminal ileum#, where specialized transport proteins allow them to be #reabsorbed#. $The terminal ileum is a typical location of activity in #Crohn disease#.  When the mucosa of the terminal ileum is inflamed, #bile acids are lost in the feces#.  As a result, a lesser amount of bile acid is present in the bile, so the ratio of cholesterol/bile acids increases.  Supersaturation of the bile with cholesterol then leads to formation of #gallstones#. $#(Choice A)#  Gallbladder hypomobility may contribute to cholesterol gallstone formation in patients with spinal cord injury or those receiving total parenteral nutrition; however, this is not observed with Crohn disease. $#(Choice C)#  Increased intestinal oxalate absorption can contribute to calcium oxalate #kidney# stone formation in patients with Crohn disease (enteric oxaluria).  However, this process is not responsible for the development of gallstones. $#(Choice D)#  Statins inhibit the rate-limiting step of cholesterol synthesis (HMG-CoA reductase), which reduces the risk of gallstone formation.  Infliximab is a tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor used to treat severe or refractory Crohn disease; it is associated with an increased risk of serious infections. $#(Choice E)#  Chronic hemolytic anemias are associated with the development of pigment gallstones due to the increased secretion of bilirubin into bile.  Crohn disease can cause anemia due to nutrient deficiency (eg, vitamin B12, iron) and chronic inflammation (eg, anemia of chronic disease), but it does not typically cause hemolysis. $#Educational objective# Patients with Crohn disease affecting the terminal ileum (most common site of involvement) are prone to developing gallstones.

Risk factors for gallstone formation include obesity or rapid weight loss, female sex, glucose intolerance, and hypomotility of the gallbladder (eg, pregnancy, prolonged fasting). $A prolonged course of #total parenteral nutrition# (TPN) is often complicated by gallstones.  In normal individuals, enteral passage of fat and amino acids into the duodenum triggers release of cholecystokinin (CCK), leading to contraction of the gallbladder.  The absence of normal enteral stimulation in patients receiving TPN leads to #decreased CCK release# and subsequent #biliary stasis#.  In addition, patients with extensive resection of the ileum can have disruption to the normal enterohepatic circulation of bile acids, leading to inadequate solubilization of biliary cholesterol and formation of cholesterol crystals. $#(Choice B)#  Advanced liver disease can impair cholesterol conversion to bile acids due to the diminished synthetic ability of injured hepatocytes, leading to supersaturation of the bile with cholesterol.

Serum triglyceride levels may rise on TPN, but TPN does not contain significant amounts of cholesterol, and serum cholesterol levels do not usually change significantly. $#(Choice D)#  Deficient supplementation of essential fatty acids in TPN is associated with a number of clinical complications, including dermatitis, alopecia, neuropathy, visual disturbances, and ataxia.  Gallstones are not related. $#(Choice E)#  Digested peptides and free amino acids in the gastric lumen are a major stimulus for gastrin release, so parenteral nutrition typically results in decreased (not increased) gastrin levels.  Moreover, gastrin is not a significant factor in the formation of gallstones. $#Educational objective# The absence of normal enteral stimulation in patients receiving total parenteral nutrition leads to decreased cholecystokinin release, biliary stasis, and increased risk of gallstones.

Other signs and symptoms of chronic pancreatitis are due to the following pathophysiologic changes: $• #Endocrine insufficiency#: Destruction of islet cells results in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. $• #Exocrine insufficiency#: Destruction of acinar cells results in lipase, elastase, amylase, trypsin, and chymotrypsin deficiency.

However, SIBO causes deconjugation of bile acids, leading to early bile acid resorption in the jejunum, reduced lipid emulsification, and #fat malabsorption#. $• Amino acids:  SIBO causes maldigestion of proteins and malabsorption of amino acids, occasionally leading to protein-losing enteropathy in severe cases. $#(Choice A)#  Defective apoprotein structure occurs in abetalipoproteinemia, an autosomal recessive disorder that presents in infancy with fat malabsorption and growth abnormalities; symptoms would not improve with antibiotics. $#(Choice B)#  Impaired release of pancreatic lipase occurs with chronic pancreatitis.  Patients typically have severe postprandial abdominal pain and steatorrhea (bulky, fat-laden stools); therapy involves pancreatic enzyme replacement, not antibiotics. $#(Choice D)#  Gastrin-secreting tumors (ie, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome) cause gastric acid hypersecretion, which lowers duodenal pH and inactivates pancreatic lipase.  Although it can cause diarrhea and fat malabsorption, hypersecretion typically presents with abdominal pain and multiple gastrointestinal ulcers; antibiotics are ineffective. $#Educational objective# Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is characterized by bacterial proliferation in the small bowel, leading to mucosal inflammation with subsequent fermentation of carbohydrates and fat malabsorption; it manifests with diarrhea, abdominal distension, and flatulence.  Patients with impaired intestinal peristalsis (eg, systemic sclerosis) are at increased risk.  Treatment includes oral antibiotics.  "

  "explanation_2": "$The stomach performs several important functions: $• #Protein digestion:#  Gastric parietal cells and chief cells produce hydrochloric acid (HCl) and pepsinogen, respectively.  HCl helps denature dietary protein (improving proteolysis) and converts pepsinogen to its active form, pepsin, which preferentially cleaves polypeptides at aromatic amino acid locations.  However, patients can still digest protein after undergoing total gastrectomy because of the action of #pancreatic and intestinal proteases#, which degrade dietary proteins into basic amino acids in the small intestine; therefore, it is unnecessary to administer gastric enzymes, HCl, or hydrolyzed protein in these patients #(choices A, B, and C)#. $• #Intrinsic factor (IF) secretion:#  Parietal cells in the body and fundus of the stomach secrete IF, a glycoprotein that binds to vitamin B12, a #water-soluble# vitamin.  The vitamin B12–IF complex is absorbed by enterocytes in the terminal ileum.  In patients who have undergone a total #gastrectomy#, IF is no longer produced, and vitamin B12 cannot be absorbed enterally in an efficient manner (only ~1% of ingested vitamin B12 is absorbed without IF).  Therefore, #lifelong administration# of B12 is required (eg, vitamin B12 injections). $• #Gastric reservoir:#  The stomach also serves as a reservoir for ingested food.  This function is lost after total gastrectomy, and accelerated emptying of hyperosmolar food boluses into the small bowel results in #dumping syndrome#, which is characterized by colicky abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea.  Avoidance of large meals and low dietary intake of simple sugars improve these symptoms. $#(Choice D)#  Medium-chain triglycerides can passively diffuse from the gastrointestinal lumen into enterocytes, but they are best absorbed after being degraded into monoglycerides and free fatty acids by lingual and pancreatic lipase.  Supplementation is not necessary in patients with total gastrectomy. $#Educational objective# Intrinsic factor is a glycoprotein that is normally secreted by parietal cells in the stomach that is necessary for the majority (~99%) of vitamin B12 absorption in the ileum.  Patients who have undergone a total gastrectomy require lifelong vitamin B12 supplementation due to inability to produce intrinsic factor.  "

Patients may also have characteristic findings due to @specific nutrient deficiencies@.  Generalized malabsorption is commonly due to defects in pancreatic secretion (eg, chronic pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis), mucosal disorders (eg, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease), bacterial overgrowth (eg, gastrointestinal surgery, abnormal motility), or parasitic diseases (eg, Giardia). $Dietary lipids are the macronutrient with the most complex digestive pathway.

  "explanation_2": "This patient's symptoms are consistent with #dumping syndrome#, a common complication of gastric surgery. $Normally, food moves through the stomach slowly, ensuring proper digestion.  First, the fundus relaxes (ie, accommodation), which allows the stomach to function as a reservoir and facilitates digestion by acid and proteases.  As food moves to the antrum, it is broken down by high-amplitude muscular contractions.  The #pyloric sphincter# serves as a barrier and allows only tiny, properly digested food particles to move to the small intestine. $When the pyloric sphincter is surgically removed or circumvented, as in @Roux-en-Y gastric bypass@, #incompletely digested food particles# enter the small intestine rapidly.  The undigested material is often #hyperosmolar# and causes fluid movement from the intravascular space to the intestinal lumen.  Activation of autonomic (sympathetic) reflexes and the release of vasoactive hormones (eg, serotonin, vasoactive intestinal peptide) may also occur.  The resulting dumping syndrome is characterized by symptoms related to the following, which typically occur within #10-30 minutes# after eating: $• Excessive intestinal fluid:  Abdominal #cramps, diarrhea#, nausea $• Vasomotor hyperactivity:  #Diaphoresis#, palpitations, flushing $• Intravascular volume depletion:  Hypotension, tachycardia $#(Choice A)#  Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth can occur after surgical creation of a blind intestinal loop that promotes bacterial colonization.  It manifests with diarrhea, bloating, nausea, and abdominal cramps.  Autonomic symptoms (eg, diaphoresis) are not typical, and this patient's symptom onset shortly after meals is more consistent with dumping syndrome. $#(Choices B and E)#  Vagal nerve injury, which impairs gastric muscular contractions and accommodation, and pyloric sphincter spasm would both delay the passage of food through the stomach.  This can manifest as early satiety, nausea, and postprandial vomiting.  Diarrhea and diaphoresis are not consistent with these disorders. $#(Choice C)#  Stenosis of the gastrojejunostomy would prevent food from entering the small intestine, leading to postprandial vomiting and abdominal pain.  It would not cause diarrhea or diaphoresis. $#Educational objective# The pyloric sphincter prevents incompletely digested hyperosmolar food particles from entering the intestines too rapidly; when the sphincter is bypassed or surgically removed, dumping syndrome may occur.

These findings are consistent with #Wilson disease#, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by accumulation of copper due to a #defective copper transport protein#, ATP7B. $In general, dietary copper is absorbed in the stomach and duodenum and bound to circulating albumin.  It is then transported to the liver and taken up by hepatocytes.  Excessive intracellular copper levels normally cause ATP7B to transfer the excess copper into the bile canaliculi.  This process is essential for biliary excretion of copper, which accounts for the majority of total body copper excretion. $In Wilson disease, defective ATP7B results in #impaired biliary excretion# of copper.  The #accumulation# of #hepatocellular copper# results in oxidative stress and apoptosis.  Upon cell death, free copper is released into the bloodstream and #deposited into extrahepatic tissues# (eg, basal ganglia, cornea), causing the classic triad of hepatic, neurologic, and psychiatric (eg, depression) symptoms. $ATP7B is also required for the hepatic production of ceruloplasmin, which is apoceruloplasmin bound to copper.

  "explanation_2": "$#Gastric acid# secretion by parietal cells in the fundus and body of the stomach is stimulated by:  $1. #Histamine# binds H2 receptors and increases intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) concentration.  $2. #Acetylcholine# binds M3 muscarinic receptors and leads to an increase in intracellular calcium. $3. #Gastrin# binds to the cholecystokinin B receptor and increases the intracellular calcium concentration.  It also stimulates histamine synthesis and release by enterochromaffin-like cells in the stomach. $Intracellular calcium and cAMP activate protein kinases and lead to increased transport of H+ by H+/K+ ATPase into the gastric lumen. $In #systemic mastocytosis#, clonal mast cell proliferation occurs in the bone marrow, skin, and other organs.  Mast cell proliferation often is associated with mutations in the #KIT# receptor tyrosine kinase.  These cells are characterized by prominent expression of mast cell tryptase.  Excessive #histamine# release from degranulation of mast cells mediates many of the symptoms of the disease, such as syncope, flushing, hypotension, pruritus, and urticaria.  In addition, histamine induces gastric acid secretion, which can lead to gastric ulceration.  The excess acid also inactivates pancreatic and intestinal enzymes, causing diarrhea.  Other gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps. $#(Choices A, B, and F)#  Gastric mucosal atrophy often results from colonization with Helicobacter pylori.  It can also be caused by autoimmune gastritis, which may lead to pernicious anemia due to loss of intrinsic factor from parietal cells.  Symptoms of atrophic gastritis may include nausea, indigestion, and epigastric discomfort, but this patient's skin symptoms are more consistent with mastocytosis. $#(Choice D)#  Gastric hypomotility (gastroparesis) occurs with diabetes mellitus, uremia, hypothyroidism, and other metabolic disorders.  Gastroparesis causes constipation, early satiety, and food stasis with vomiting. $#(Choice E)#  Pancreatic endocrine tumors may secrete gastrin (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome), insulin (hypoglycemia), glucagon (hyperglycemia, rash), somatostatin (diarrhea, cholelithiasis, hyperglycemia), or vasoactive intestinal peptide (watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, achlorhydria).  These disorders would not be associated with excess mast cells in the skin. $#Educational objective# Systemic mastocytosis is characterized by the abnormal proliferation of mast cells and increased histamine release.  Histamine causes hypersecretion of gastric acid by parietal cells in the stomach as well as a variety of other symptoms (eg, hypotension, flushing, pruritus).  "

Urgent surgical intervention is required, as lack of intervention can lead to death (due to cirrhosis) usually within 2 years. $#(Choice B)#  Gilbert syndrome is an inherited, benign condition of reduced production of glucuronyl transferase, a hepatic enzyme responsible for @glucuronidation@ (ie, conversion of bilirubin to its excretable form).  Patients are usually asymptomatic except at times of stress (eg, fasting, illness) during which mild, indirect hyperbilirubinemia and jaundice are present. $#(Choice C)#  Galactosemia (galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase [GALT] deficiency) is characterized by defective metabolism of galactose, a breakdown product of lactose that is then normally metabolized to glucose.  Both direct and indirect bilirubin levels may be elevated.  However, infants would present with vomiting, diarrhea, and lethargy during the first few days of life due to inability to digest breast milk or formula. $#(Choice D)#  Breast milk jaundice causes an indirect hyperbilirubinemia that peaks at age 2 weeks.

  "explanation_2": "Hepatitis B virus infection progresses through two phases: the proliferative phase and the integrative phase. $In the proliferative phase, the entire virion and all related antigens of the episomal HBV DNA are present.  On the hepatocyte cell surface, viral HBsAg and HBcAg are expressed in conjunction with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules.  This expression serves to activate the cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes, which respond by destroying the infected hepatocytes.  Note that the virion itself does not have a cytopathic effect. $In the integrative phase, the HBV DNA is incorporated into the host genome of those hepatocytes that survived the immune response.  Infectivity ceases and liver damage tapers off when the antiviral antibodies appear and viral replication stops.  The risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, however, remains elevated because of the HBV DNA that has been integrated into the host genome. $#(Choice A)#  Hepatitis B virus has no direct cytotoxic effect. $#(Choice B)#  Host antibody HBsAb neutralizes HBV infectivity by binding to the viral surface antigen HBsAg and preventing the antigen from interacting with hepatocyte receptors.  Note that this neutralization occurs before the virus enters the hepatocyte, and therefore would not be associated with hepatocellular damage. $#(Choice C)#  Antigen-antibody complexes cause some of the early symptoms of hepatitis B virus infection (eg, arthralgias, arthritis, and urticaria) as well as some of the chronic complications (eg, immune complex glomerulonephritis, cryoglobulinemia, vasculitis).  These complexes are not responsible for hepatocellular damage, however. $#(Choice D)#  The pathogenesis of autoimmune hepatitis (not hepatitis B infection) involves antigen mimicry with generation of self-antigen recognizing CD4+ T lymphocytes that damage hepatocytes. $#Educational objective# Hepatitis B virus does not have a cytotoxic effect itself; however, the presence of viral HBsAg and HBcAg on the cell surface stimulate the host's cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes to destroy infected hepatocytes.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient has cardiomyopathy with visible brown discoloration, which could represent lipofuscin (age-related pigment) or hemosiderin (iron deposition).  However, her liver specimen shows diffuse infiltration of iron (visible as blue pigment granules after #Prussian blue# staining), confirming a diagnosis of iron overload.  Given that her brother likely developed cirrhosis complicated by variceal hemorrhage in his 40s, the most probable underlying cause is #hereditary hemochromatosis (HH)#. $Total iron stores in the body are tightly regulated at the point of intake, with gastrointestinal absorption adjusted to match daily losses.  HH is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by #increased intestinal iron absorption#; because there is no specific mechanism to excrete unneeded iron, the excess iron (typically 0.5-1.0 g/yr) accumulates in the parenchymal organs (eg, liver, heart). $HH is usually silent in early adulthood, manifesting only after >20 g of iron has accumulated in the body.  Men typically begin to develop symptoms in their 30s and 40s.  However, #premenopausal women# have ongoing #blood (and iron) losses# due to #menstruation#, which partially offsets the excess iron absorption.  Women therefore #develop manifestations later#, typically several years after menopause (ie, variable expressivity based on sex). $#(Choices A and C)#  Most patients with HH have inactivating mutations in the HFE gene that cause impaired hepcidin secretion.  Disease development requires biallelic genetic mutations (ie, affecting both alleles); heterozygotes are unaffected.  Although biallelic HFE inactivation is necessary to develop the condition, most patients (>70%) with biallelic mutations never develop HH (ie, the disease exhibits incomplete penetrance) due to genetic and environmental modifiers.  However, this patient developed HH manifestations at a typical age for women, which would not be explained by heterozygosity or incomplete penetrance. $#(Choice B)#  Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and citric acid enhance the absorption of inorganic iron in the gastrointestinal tract and therefore might lead to earlier disease manifestations instead of slowing its onset. $#(Choice E)#  Frequent blood transfusions can also lead to iron overload and hemosiderosis (iron accumulation in parenchymal tissues).  The opposite, therapeutic phlebotomy, is the preferred treatment for HH and has been shown to slow its progression. $#Educational objective# Hereditary hemochromatosis is characterized by increased intestinal iron absorption with deposition of excess iron in parenchymal tissues.  Men typically develop manifestations in their 30s and 40s.  However, premenopausal women have ongoing blood and iron losses due to menstruation, which partially offsets the excess iron absorption and delays the onset of symptoms.  "

Vitamin E is a #fat-soluble# vitamin responsible for preventing oxidative damage.  The cells most susceptible to reactive oxygen species are erythrocytes (resulting in hemolysis) and neurons with long axons (ie, high surface area).  Spinal cord involvement explains this patient's #loss of vibratory sensation# (dorsal columns) and #ataxia# (spinocerebellar tract); her #weakness# (eg, frequent falls) and #hyporeflexia# are secondary to peripheral neuropathies. $Deficiency of vitamin E is rare in resource-rich regions due to widespread availability in dietary sources; instead, the most common cause is #fat malabsorption#.  Normally, bile salts emulsify lipid globules (containing fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K) to form water-soluble @micelles@.  Micelle formation allows pancreatic lipase to effectively hydrolyze fats, allowing for efficient absorption of fat-soluble vitamins.  Patients at risk for deficiency include those with #impaired bile acid secretion# or exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (eg, chronic pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis). $In this case, symptoms of vitamin E deficiency in a woman with chronic fatigue and #vague abdominal pain# are suspicious for @primary biliary cholangitis@, an autoimmune disorder in which destruction of small, intrahepatic bile ducts causes impaired bile acid secretion due to obstruction of biliary flow. $#(Choice A)#  Fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies can occur in exocrine pancreatic insufficiency due to decreased lipase, not amylase.  In contrast, decreased pancreatic amylase results in impaired carbohydrate digestion. $#(Choice B)#  Excessive liver @hepcidin@, which occurs with chronic inflammation/infection, down-regulates gastrointestinal iron absorption.  Patients can have fatigue and weakness due to iron deficiency, but the associated anemia is microcytic, not normocytic or hemolytic.  In addition, this patient's neurologic findings would not be expected. $#(Choice D)#  Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) deficiency can present with anemia and neurologic findings.  However, gastric intrinsic factor is required for absorption of vitamin B12, and lack of (not excessive) intrinsic factor causes deficiency (pernicious anemia).  Moreover, erythrocytes would be macrocytic, and neutrophils would be hypersegmented. $#(Choice E)#  Renal hydroxylation converts 25-hydroxyvitamin D into the active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.  Reduced renal hydroxylation (eg, chronic kidney disease) predisposes to bone pain and fractures due to vitamin D deficiency. $#Educational objective# Fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) require micelle formation for absorption, and risk factors for deficiency include disorders affecting bile production (eg, primary biliary cholangitis).

Because bile acids are important for solubilization and absorption of fats, patients with #chronic biliary obstruction# due to PBC may develop #deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins# (A, D, E, and K).  Generalized pruritus is common due to bile acid accumulation in the skin; jaundice is often not apparent until later in the disease course. $#(Choices A and B)#  Inadequate exposure to sunlight can cause vitamin D deficiency in individuals without adequate dietary vitamin D intake.  Chronic kidney disease can also result in vitamin D deficiency due to reduced production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.  Vitamin D deficiency is characterized by bone pain and fractures (eg, osteomalacia), not night blindness. $#(Choice D)#  Sickle cell disease is a form of chronic hemolytic anemia that can cause retinopathy due to microvascular vasoocclusion, retinal ischemia, and neovascularization/hemorrhage.  However, vision impairment would not be restricted to nighttime, and affected patients would likely have other vasoocclusive symptoms (eg, pain crises). $#(Choice E)#  A strict vegan diet is a risk factor for vitamin B12 (cobalamin), not vitamin A, deficiency.  Vitamin B12 deficiency presents with megaloblastic anemia (eg, fatigue, pallor) and neurologic deficits (eg, tingling, numbness). $#Educational objective# Vitamin A deficiency causes night blindness and hyperkeratosis.  Deficiency of this lipid-soluble vitamin can develop in patients with fat malabsorption due to chronic biliary obstruction, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, or small-bowel resection.  ",

  "explanation_2": "$#Crohn disease# is an inflammatory bowel disease characterized by patchy granulomatous inflammation.  Any area of the gastrointestinal tract may be involved, but involvement of the #terminal ileum# is especially common.  Bile acids, which facilitate the absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins, are normally reabsorbed in the ileum, recycled in the liver, and then reused in the absorptive process.  When the terminal ileum is inflamed, bile acids are lost in the feces, leading to #impaired fat absorption#. $In the healthy bowel, dietary calcium binds to dietary oxalate, producing insoluble calcium oxalate salts that are eliminated in the feces.  But in malabsorptive syndromes such as Crohn disease, calcium forms soap complexes with the excess fat in the intestinal lumen and is unavailable for complexing with oxalate.  As a result, free #oxalate absorption# is increased and subsequently filtered into the urine, promoting the formation of #oxalate kidney stones# (enteric oxaluria). $#(Choice A)#  Cystinuria is an autosomal recessive condition characterized by defective dibasic amino acid transport in the proximal renal tubules.  The urine becomes supersaturated with cystine, leading to formation of cystine stones beginning in childhood or adolescence.  Crohn disease can cause malabsorption of dietary protein and amino acids, but this is due to inflammation, not abnormal amino acid transporters; patients are not predisposed to cystine stones. $#(Choice B)#  Patients with Crohn disease commonly develop vitamin/nutrient deficiencies (eg, vitamin D, calcium) due to malabsorption, which can reduce bone mineral density and increase the risk of fractures.  Secondary hyperparathyroidism may be present, but unlike primary hyperparathyroidism does not promote kidney stone formation. $#(Choice C)#  Uric acid stones may develop from conditions associated with rapid cell turnover (eg, myeloproliferative disease, hemolytic anemia) due to chronically increased uric acid production.  The stones seen in Crohn disease are composed of calcium oxalate rather than uric acid. $#(Choice E)#  Alkalinization of the urine by urease-producing organisms (eg, Proteus, Klebsiella) in the upper urinary tract can promote formation of stones made up of magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) and calcium carbonate apatite.  Although patients with Crohn disease can develop enterovesicular fistulas and recurrent urinary tract infections, this patient has no features of urinary infection (eg, fever, dysuria, pyuria). $#Educational objective# Crohn disease is associated with oxalate kidney stones.  Impaired bile acid absorption in the terminal ileum leads to loss of bile acids in feces with subsequent fat malabsorption.  Intestinal lipids then bind calcium ions, and the resulting soap complex is excreted.  Free oxalate (normally bound by calcium to form an unabsorbable complex) is absorbed and forms urinary calculi (enteric oxaluria).  "

Hepatic encephalopathy refers to a reversible decline in neurologic function that occurs due to failure of the liver to metabolize waste products such as ammonia.  Ammonia is normally produced by the GI tract as a result of enterocytic catabolism of glutamine and colonic bacterial catabolism of dietary protein.  GI bleeding causes #increased nitrogen delivery# to the gut in the form of hemoglobin, which is then converted into ammonia and absorbed into the bloodstream.  The ammonia then enters the liver through the portal vein and is detoxified to urea. $In chronic liver failure, hepatocyte dysfunction and the shunting of blood through portosystemic collaterals impair the liver's detoxification ability.  This leads to #accumulation of ammonia# and other neurotoxins in the circulation, causing altered amino acid transport across the blood-brain barrier, impaired neurotransmitter metabolism, and depressed cerebral glucose metabolism.  These and other factors result in #increased inhibitory neurotransmission# (eg, γ-aminobutyric acid [GABA]) and #impaired excitatory neurotransmitter release# (eg, glutamate, catecholamines). $In patients with hepatic encephalopathy, lowering of blood ammonia levels is typically accomplished with oral administration of a disaccharide (eg, #lactulose#).  Bacterial action on lactulose results in acidification of colonic contents, which then converts absorbable ammonia into nonabsorbable ammonium ions, trapping it in the stool and thereby increasing fecal nitrogen excretion. $#(Choice A)#  Accumulation of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is suggestive of renal failure, heart failure, or dehydration.  In healthy patients, GI bleeding can also cause a rapid increase in BUN.  However, this patient has cirrhosis, which is associated with decreased BUN because ammonia cannot be efficiently converted to urea by the failing liver. $#(Choice B)#  Bacterial meningitis presents with altered mental status, fever, nuchal rigidity, headache, and photophobia.  In addition, asterixis (flapping tremor) is specific for metabolic encephalopathies. $#(Choice C)#  The altered mental status seen in hepatic encephalopathy is due to increased (not decreased) activity of the GABA neurotransmitter system.  This enhanced activity is caused by increased GABA receptor affinity and alterations in neurosteroid synthesis rather than increased GABA production. $#(Choice E)#  The middle cerebral artery is the largest cerebral artery and the one most commonly involved in cerebrovascular accidents.  This patient's presentation is suggestive of hepatic encephalopathy rather than stroke. $#Educational objective# Hepatic encephalopathy is caused by increased levels of ammonia and other neurotoxins in the circulation that lead to increased inhibitory neurotransmission and impaired excitatory neurotransmitter release.

It is also associated with a number of drugs (eg, methotrexate, phenytoin) and certain inborn metabolic errors. $#Educational objective# Multiple inhibitory mechanisms exist to prevent premature activation of trypsinogen before it reaches the duodenal lumen, including cleavage inactivation of trypsin by trypsin itself and production of trypsin inhibitors (eg, SPINK1).  Gene mutations that render trypsin insensitive to cleavage inactivation cause hereditary pancreatitis.  ",

  "explanation_2": "$Most @pancreatic enzymes@ are synthesized by pancreatic acinar cells as inactive enzyme precursors called zymogens.  Zymogen granules are secreted from the apical surface of acinar cells into the lumen.  After traversing the pancreatic duct system, they drain through the ampulla of Vater into the descending part of the duodenum.  The enzyme enterokinase (secreted from intestinal mucosa) cleaves trypsinogen into trypsin, its active form.  Once a small quantity of trypsin is produced, it activates other zymogens, including chymotrypsin, elastase, and carboxypeptidase, through proteolytic cleavage.  Trypsin can also cleave trypsinogen to produce more trypsin, accelerating pancreatic enzyme activation in the duodenum. $The pathogenesis of #acute pancreatitis# begins with either a toxic or an ischemic injury to the acinar cells that leads to #premature activation of trypsin# inside the pancreatic acini.  Trypsin then activates the other proteolytic enzymes and starts a self-sustaining cycle of pancreatic inflammation and autodigestion with further release of digestive enzymes.  In severe cases, this process can result in #necrotizing pancreatitis#, which is characterized by gross areas of parenchymal necrosis with a high propensity for secondary bacterial infection. $#(Choice A)#  Amylase hydrolyzes starch to produce maltose (a glucose-glucose disaccharide) and trisaccharide maltotriose and limit dextrins.

It does not require activation by trypsin (although its activity is increased by colipase, which is activated by trypsin).  Release of lipase during acute pancreatitis causes the formation of characteristic calcium soap deposits (fat necrosis). $#Educational objective# Pancreatic zymogens are normally converted into their active form by trypsin in the duodenal lumen.  Premature cleavage of trypsinogen to trypsin within the pancreas leads to uncontrolled activation of these zymogens, causing pancreatic autodigestion and acute pancreatitis.  ",

Gastroparesis is a type of #autonomic neuropathy# involving the gastrointestinal tract and is characterized by delayed gastric emptying not due to an obstruction. $Normal postprandial gastric activity is a multistep process that occurs in response to food ingestion.  After food passes down the esophagus, vagally stimulated enteric neurons release nitric oxide to induce relaxation of the fundus of the stomach and accommodate the incoming food bolus.  Specialized gastric pacemaker cells (interstitial cells of Cajal) initiate pacesetter potentials (slow waves), which generate circumferential contractions of the gastric smooth muscle (peristalsis).  Peristalsis facilitates food mixing and propulsion toward the pylorus. $#Chronic hyperglycemia# in patients with diabetes can result in #destruction of the enteric neurons#.

  "explanation_2": "This patient had self-resolving scleral icterus and #isolated indirect hyperbilirubinemia# associated with a period of stress.  These findings are consistent with #Gilbert syndrome#, the most common inherited disorder of bilirubin metabolism. $@Normal bilirubin metabolism@ begins with hepatic uptake of unconjugated bilirubin produced from red blood cell turnover.  Within the liver, UDP glucuronosyltransferase conjugates bilirubin with glucuronic acid, after which conjugated bilirubin is excreted into bile canaliculi. $In @Gilbert syndrome@, a genetic mutation results in reduced enzymatic activity of UDP glucuronosyltransferase and therefore decreased bilirubin conjugation #(choices B and D)#.  Triggers associated with increased bilirubin production (eg, stress, illness, hemolysis) result in #episodic exacerbations# of indirect hyperbilirubinemia, as seen in this patient.  Because bilirubin excretion into the bile duct is normal in Gilbert syndrome, hepatocyte bilirubin storage is also normal, as is liver histology #(choices A and E)#. $Notably, impaired bilirubin conjugation also occurs in Crigler-Najjar syndrome, but patients typically have severe, chronic hyperbilirubinemia that begins in the neonatal period and can be associated with bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction. $#(Choice C)#  Dubin-Johnson syndrome is a benign, inherited disorder of bilirubin metabolism characterized by defective hepatic excretion of bilirubin into the biliary system.  Bilirubin conjugation is normal, but defective excretion results in increased hepatocyte storage of bilirubin, resulting in dense liver pigmentation.  Although patients often have recurrent episodes of scleral icterus, elevated direct bilirubin is expected due to reflux of conjugated bilirubin back into the plasma. $#Educational objective# Gilbert syndrome is characterized by indirect hyperbilirubinemia due to decreased bilirubin conjugation.  Patients have recurrent, self-resolving episodes of scleral icterus and jaundice triggered by stress.  ",

C difficile toxins A and B stimulate an inflammatory reaction and disrupt the actin cytoskeletal structure, resulting in pseudomembranous colitis characterized by crampy abdominal pain, watery diarrhea, and leukocytosis.

  "explanation_2": "#Hepatitis C virus# (HCV) is a blood-borne pathogen that is primarily transmitted via injection drug use or transfusion of blood products (prior to widespread screening in 1992).  Chronic infection develops in most individuals and increases the risk for cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.  Because chronic HCV infection is often asymptomatic for decades, patients are often unaware that they have contracted the virus until they receive HCV screening. $Treatment of chronic HCV infection is with direct-acting# #antiviral (DAA) agents, which target specific enzymes in the HCV life cycle to #inhibit viral replication and assembly#, as follows: $• #RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors# – HCV binds to and enters host cells, uncoats, and subsequently replicates its genome using HCV-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.  Nucleotide/non-nucleoside RNA polymerase inhibitors such as #sofosbuvir# target this step. $• #Protease inhibitors# – HCV mRNA is translated by host ribosomes into a polyprotein, which is cleaved by HCV protease into the individual proteins that compose the virus.  HCV protease inhibitors such as simeprevir target this step. $• #NS5A inhibitors# – The HCV protein NS5A is crucial for viral replication and assembly (through unclear mechanisms) and is targeted by HCV medications such as #ledipasvir#. $DAA treatment results in a sustained virologic response (complete elimination of virus) in >97% of treated individuals. $#(Choice A)#  HCV does not contain a reverse transcriptase enzyme so it does not integrate its genome into the host cell.  Therefore, there are no reverse transcriptase inhibitors for HCV.  Reverse transcriptase inhibitors are a mainstay of therapy for HIV. $#(Choice B)#  Interferon-alpha was previously used in the treatment of chronic HCV (in combination with ribavirin) to trigger a broad antiviral immune response.  However, interferon therapy has a lower cure rate (50%-80%) and a much higher incidence of side effects (eg, flu-like symptoms).  Therefore, DAAs are now used preferentially. $#(Choice C)#  HIV fusion inhibitors (eg, enfuvirtide) and CCR5 inhibitors (eg, maraviroc) inhibit the ability of @HIV to enter cells@.  DAAs do not target viral entry. $#(Choice E)#  Although HCV virion release could be a target for DAAs, there are currently no approved medications that target this step.  Virion release (budding) is targeted by neuraminidase inhibitors in the treatment of influenza. $#Educational objective# Chronic hepatitis C virus infection is treated with direct-acting antiviral (DAAs) medications such as ledipasvir and sofosbuvir.  These medications target specific HCV enzymes (eg, protease, NS5A, RNA polymerase), which inhibits viral replication and assembly.  Treatment with DAAs results in cure in >97% of patients.  ",

However, there is no association between pancreatic enzyme secretion and CDI. $#(Choice B)#  Cell-mediated immunity is not essential for prevention of CDI, but it is required to eradicate infections with intracellular agents that avoid the humoral (antibody) immune response (eg, Legionella, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Listeria monocytogenes, viruses, Leishmania). $#(Choice C)#  Individuals usually develop serum antibodies against C difficile toxins, not spores (the inactive, dormant form of the bacteria). $#(Choice E)#  Rapid gastrointestinal transit is rarely effective at \"washing away\" pathogenic diarrhea-causing organisms as they are well adapted to adhering to the gut mucosa in the setting of voluminous diarrhea. $#Educational objective# Alteration of the normal intestinal microbial flora (eg, antibiotic therapy, gastric acid suppression) can allow overgrowth of pathogenic strains of Clostridioides difficile, which produce enterotoxin (toxin A) and cytotoxin (toxin B).  Clinical disease can range from transient diarrhea to severe pseudomembranous colitis.  "

Given his histologic findings consistent with @pseudomembrane@ formation, this presentation is highly suggestive of #Clostridioides difficile# #infection# (CDI) (formerly Clostridium genus).  C difficile is an anaerobic, spore-forming, toxigenic, gram-positive rod that causes infectious colitis.  The most significant risk factor for the development of CDI is antibiotic use.  Antibiotics (particularly clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, and cephalosporins) alter the normal bowel flora, thereby predisposing to C difficile overgrowth.  Other risk factors include hospitalization, older age, and proton pump inhibitor use. $C difficile produces 2 toxins:  Toxin A (enterotoxin) and Toxin B (cytotoxin).  These toxins disrupt cellular cytoskeletons and intercellular tight junctions, leading to colonocyte apoptosis.  The colonic mucosa responds to toxin exposure by forming yellow-white, patchy @pseudomembranes@, which consist of a #neutrophil-predominant# inflammatory infiltrate, #fibrin#, bacteria, and necrotic epithelium.  Patients with severe disease may develop a nonobstructive colonic dilation known as #toxic megacolon#, which leads to increased risk of colonic perforation (as seen in this patient). $#(Choice A)#  Campylobacter jejuni is associated with watery diarrhea that may become bloody, abdominal cramping, and fever.

Enteroviral meningoencephalitis risk is also increased in this condition, but patients are usually febrile with altered mental status (eg, lethargy). $#(Choice D)#  Certain inborn errors of metabolism (eg, maple syrup urine disease) can manifest with hypotonia, weakness, and poor feeding; urine amino acids and/or ketones are typically elevated.  In contrast to this case, however, symptom onset is usually in the neonatal period, vomiting is a typical finding, and paralysis would not be expected. $#(Choice E)#  Ketonuria with glucosuria can occur in diabetic ketoacidosis, but this diagnosis would be extremely unlikely in a young infant and would not cause complete loss of tone. $#Educational objective# Infant botulism can result from the consumption of honey, which frequently contains C botulinum spores.

This form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma arises from post–germinal center memory B cells, which typically express the markers found on all B cells (eg, CD19, CD20), as well as mature B-cell markers (eg, CD22). $Most MALT lymphomas are thought to arise due to #chronic immune stimulation# from bacterial, viral, or autoimmune conditions.  The most common trigger for gastric MALT lymphoma is #Helicobacter pylori infection#, which leads to local recruitment and proliferation of antigen-specific T and B lymphocytes.  Over time, chronic immune stimulation results in the emergence of a #monoclonal B-cell# line that proliferates excessively in the presence of H pylori antigens.  This cell line eventually accumulates genetic abnormalities that allow it to proliferate in an #antigen-independent fashion#, resulting in spread away from the local site of infection. $Because most cases of gastric MALT lymphoma are tightly linked to H pylori infection, antimicrobial treatment can often result in complete remission of early-stage disease due to elimination of the bacterial antigens driving tumor proliferation. $#(Choices B and E)#  Certain human papillomavirus (HPV) serotypes cause epithelial cancers of the head, neck, cervix, and anus.  Oncogenesis is mediated via production of the viral protein E6, which degrades host P53 protein, a promoter of cell repair after DNA damage and negative regulator of the cell cycle.  HPV also integrates into the host genome, resulting in DNA damage that contributes to oncogenesis. $#(Choice C)#  Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a lymphotropic, oncogenic virus associated with certain B- and T-cell lymphomas.  In latent EBV infection, episomal EBV DNA generates low levels of viral proteins that allow it to evade the host immune response.  The viral proteins also activate proliferation-promoting and antiapoptotic host genes, leading to oncogenesis in a minority of cases. $#(Choice D)#  Within B cells, somatic hypermutation at the variable region of the immunoglobulin gene allows the generation of diverse antibodies.  Hypermutation allows for B-cell production of high-affinity immunoglobulins against the immunizing antigen; they are not a cause of oncogenesis in MALT lymphomas (which arise from post-germinal center memory B cells). $#Educational objective# Helicobacter pylori is associated with gastric MALT lymphoma due to chronic stimulation of the immune response; the continuous cell division predisposes to accumulation of mutations that result in aberrant B-cell proliferation.  Treatment of H pylori can induce remission in the majority of cases of early-stage gastric MALT lymphomas.  "

As a result, the RNA polymerase makes many errors during replication, and several dozen subspecies of HCV are typically present in the blood of an infected individual at any one time. $#(Choice B)#  5' → 3' exonuclease activity allows DNA polymerase I to engage in nick translation, which is important for both DNA repair and removal of RNA primers during replication.  This feature is not the cause of instability in HCV. $#(Choice C)#  DNA glycosylase is important in base excision repair as it removes the nitrogen base from the sugar-phosphate backbone.  An endonuclease then completes the remainder of the repair.  This enzyme is not the cause of instability in HCV. $#(Choice D)#  DNA ligase is used to join 2 fragments of DNA and is therefore necessary for both DNA repair and replication.  The HCV genome is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA molecule that does not require ligase activity during replication. $#(Choice E)#  Nucleotide specificity refers to the importance of inserting the correct nucleotide (eg, adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymine, uracil) into a strand of DNA or RNA.  It is not the cause of instability in HCV. $#(Choice F)#  DNA primase is a form of RNA polymerase.  In bacteria, it binds with DNA helicase and synthesizes a short RNA primer to which nucleotides can be added by DNA polymerase.  This enzyme is not the cause of instability in HCV. $#Educational objective# The hepatitis C virus is genetically unstable because it lacks proofreading 3' → 5' exonuclease activity in its RNA polymerase.  Its envelope glycoprotein sequences also contain a hypervariable region prone to frequent genetic mutation.  "

Three main #airway-protective movements# occur during @normal swallowing@: $• #Displacement of the larynx superiorly# and anteriorly under the base of tongue, which allows food to be directed into the more posteriorly located esophagus $• #Tilting of the epiglottis# to block the airway $• Closing of the glottis by #adduction of the vocal folds# $Because of the complexity of swallowing, patients who sustain #strokes# often have persistent #dysphagia and/or aspiration#.  If a neurologic deficit cannot be corrected, behavioral modifications can sometimes improve the safety of swallowing.  A #chin-tuck maneuver# (ie, flexion of the head and neck during swallowing) sometimes helps.  The maneuver seems to decrease the distance from the hyoid bone to the larynx (#simulating elevation of the larynx#), as well as to narrow the distance of the laryngeal entrance, leading to decreased aspiration. $#(Choice A)#  The first phase of swallowing is the oral preparatory phase, in which food is chewed and mixed with saliva to form a controlled bolus.  Although impaired mastication can lead to poor bolus formation, flexion of the head and neck does not generally change the mechanics of mastication. $#(Choice B)#  Elevation of the soft palate primarily prevents food from entering the nasopharynx rather than the larynx. $#(Choice C)#  Contraction of the base of tongue occurs during the pharyngeal phase of swallowing and pushes the bolus posteriorly into the pharynx.  Head and neck flexion could potentially worsen this function by increasing the distance that the base of tongue has to contract and by increasing the anterior force on the tongue due to gravity. $#(Choice E)#  Although adduction of the vocal folds is an important airway-protective mechanism, head and neck flexion would not alter vocal fold movement. $#Educational objective# The most important airway-protective movements during swallowing are the anterior/superior displacement of the larynx, the tilting of the epiglottis to block the airway, and vocal fold adduction.

  "explanation_2": "Pregnancy has multiple effects in the gastrointestinal tract due to increasing levels of progesterone and estrogen as well as the effects of a gravid uterus on surrounding structures.  #Constipation# is particularly common in pregnant patients and is largely due to the effects of #progesterone#, which has been shown to #reduce colonic smooth muscle activity#.  Progesterone also prevents the release of motilin, a hormone responsible for stimulating the fasting migrating myoelectric complex, which normally helps propel undigested food from the small intestines into the colon.  Constipation may be exacerbated in later stages of pregnancy as the gravid uterus increases pressure on the small intestine, slowing intestinal transit. $Other common gastrointestinal alterations in pregnancy include reduced lower esophageal sphincter pressure (promoting gastroesophageal reflux) and gallbladder stasis (increasing the likelihood of developing gallstones).  Hemorrhoids are also common and result from a rise in pressure within the rectal venous system due to the gravid uterus. $#(Choice B)#  The parasympathetic nervous system stimulates peristalsis and gastrointestinal motility.  Reduced parasympathetic input to the colon can lead to constipation; however, this typically occurs with neurologic disorders (eg, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis). $#(Choice C)#  Defecatory dysfunction results from an inability to relax pelvic floor muscles, which prevents proper evacuation of stool from the rectal vault.  Although this can occur after trauma (eg, traumatic vaginal delivery), it is not a physiologic change that occurs during pregnancy. $#(Choice D)#  Thickened intestinal secretions can cause constipation; however, this is typically seen in patients with cystic fibrosis, which affects water and electrolyte transportation.  Patients with cystic fibrosis are typically diagnosed in infancy and have recurrent respiratory infections and failure to thrive. $#(Choice E)#  Rectoceles occur when the rectum herniates into the vaginal canal through a thinned rectovaginal septum.  Although they also cause constipation, rectoceles typically occur in elderly individuals with a history of multiple vaginal deliveries, not during pregnancy.  Patients often report needing to manually compress the vagina to induce bowel movements. $#Educational objective# Constipation is common during pregnancy and results from the inhibitory effect of progesterone on colonic smooth muscle contractions and the fasting migrating myoelectric complex.

Dietary proteins exist predominately as polypeptides; in order to be absorbed, they must be hydrolyzed to tripeptides, dipeptides, and amino acids.  Hydrolysis begins in the stomach with the activation of pepsin by hydrochloric acid; it continues in the proximal small intestine, catalyzed by the pancreatic enzymes trypsin, chymotrypsin, carboxypeptidase, and elastase. $Pancreatic enzymes, including trypsin, are secreted in their inactive forms.  #Enteropeptidase#, a duodenal brush border enzyme, is responsible for #activation of trypsin# from its inactive precursor, trypsinogen.

The cephalic phase is mediated primarily by cholinergic and vagal mechanisms, and is triggered by the thought, sight, smell, and taste of food.  The gastric phase is mediated by the presence of gastrin (which stimulates histamine secretion and therefore, indirectly, acid secretion), and is triggered by the chemical stimulus of food and distension of the stomach.  The intestinal phase is initiated when protein-containing food enters the duodenum, but this phase plays only a minor role in stimulating gastric acid secretion. $In fact, intestinal influences are effective in down-regulating gastric acid secretion after a meal.  The ileum and colon release peptide YY, which binds to receptors on the endocrine, histamine-containing cells described as enterochromaffin-like (ECLs).  Such binding counteracts the cephalic and gastric phases of acid secretion by inhibiting gastrin-stimulated histamine release from ECLs.  Other factors that inhibit acid secretion include somatostatin and prostaglandins. $#(Choice A)#  Basal gastric secretion has been defined as the gastric juices secreted in the absence of intentional or avoidable stimuli (essentially, the \"baseline\" gastric acid secretion).  Basal gastric secretion is not an important factor in the down-regulation of postprandial gastric secretion. $#(Choices B and C)#  The cephalic and gastric phases both stimulate gastric acid secretion, not down-regulate it. $#(Choice E)#  Receptive relaxation is a reflex that allows the gastric fundus to dilate in anticipation of food passing through the pharynx and esophagus.  It is not an important factor in the down-regulation of postprandial gastric secretion. $#(Choice F)#  Postprandial alkaline tide is defined as an increase in plasma HCO3‾ and decrease in plasma Cl‾ secondary to the surge of acid within the gastric lumen.  It is not an important factor in the down-regulation of postprandial gastric secretion. $#Educational objective# The cephalic and gastric phases stimulate gastric acid secretion, while intestinal influences tend to reduce gastric acid secretion.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient's recurrent epigastric pain after eating fat- and protein-rich meals strongly suggests #biliary colic# from underlying gallstones and/or biliary sludge.  Most commonly, gallstones are cholesterol based, often developing in persons older than age 40.  Elevated estrogen exposure (eg, female sex, obesity, pregnancy) significantly increases the risk because it stimulates cholesterol-rich bile secretion. $When bile becomes supersaturated with cholesterol, microscopic crystal formation creates a thick slurry (biliary sludge), with further aggregation producing gallstones.  On detecting fat- and protein-rich chyme, I cells lining the duodenum and jejunum release the hormone #cholecystokinin# (CCK), causing the #gallbladder to contract#.  This contraction may force gallstones and sludge against the gallbladder outlet; the resulting occlusion increases intragallbladder pressure, leading to pain that is typically felt in the #right subcostal or epigastric# region.  As CCK levels wane, the gallstones and sludge fall back, relieving pressure (ie, a postprandial waxing-waning pain pattern). $In addition to stimulating gallbladder contraction, CCK also increases pancreatic enzyme secretion and relaxes the sphincter of Oddi, thereby orchestrating fatty and amino acid absorption. $#(Choice B)#  Patients with lactose intolerance often have postprandial abdominal pain after ingesting dairy products.  However, the pain usually occurs with bloating and diarrhea, symptoms not present in this patient. $#(Choice C)#  Prostaglandins (eg, PGE2, PGI2) help protect the gastric mucosa from damage by acid; in contrast, excess consumption of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can inhibit production of gastroprotective prostaglandins, increasing the risk for gastric ulcers that may cause postprandial epigastric pain. $#(Choice D)#  Secretin is a hormone that stimulates the pancreas to secrete bicarbonate, helping to regulate pH in the duodenum.  Although it also increases bicarbonate secretion by the biliary tract, it does not induce gallbladder contraction. $#(Choice E)#  Carcinoid tumors can secrete high amounts of serotonin, causing flushing, diarrhea, and bronchospasm.  They most commonly present with periodic abdominal pain, which arises from mesenteric fibrosis or bowel kinking/obstruction rather than increased serotonin. $#(Choice F)#  Somatostatin suppresses gastrointestinal hormone release (eg, insulin, CCK, vasoactive intestinal peptide), reduces intestinal motility, and decreases splanchnic blood flow. $#Educational objective# The release of cholecystokinin (CCK) from the duodenum and jejunum after exposure to fat- and protein-rich meals stimulates gallbladder contraction.  In patients with gallstones or biliary sludge, contraction can force the stones/sludge against the gallbladder outlet, causing temporary occlusion of outflow and increased intragallbladder pressure. This manifests as postprandial upper abdominal pain that waxes and wanes with CCK levels (biliary colic).  "

  "explanation_2": "$This patient with a history of heavy alcohol use, abdominal swelling with shifting dullness to percussion (indicative of intraabdominal fluid), and stigmata of chronic liver disease (eg, spider angiomas, jaundice) has #ascites# due to cirrhosis.  #Cirrhosis# occurs from progressive hepatic fibrosis, resulting #portal hypertension# due to increased sinusoidal blood flow resistance.  There is also increased formation of vasodilatory factors (eg, nitric oxide), possibly due to bacterial products (eg, endotoxins) that accumulate because of reduced host defenses and increased portosystemic shunting.  This results in the following hemodynamic alterations: $• Reduced systemic vascular resistance along with blood pooling in the splanchnic vascular bed leads to reduced blood pressure.  Heart rate and cardiac output increase to compensate (hyperdynamic circulation). $• Reduced renal perfusion leads to activation of the @renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)@ and #increased release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) #in an effort to restore circulating volume. $• The combined aldosterone and ADH effects lead to #increased renal resorption of sodium# (ie, lower urine sodium) and water. $Although this restores renal perfusion, the resistance to splanchnic flow and hyperdynamic circulation promotes third-spacing of fluids into the abdominal cavity (ie, ascites) and interstitium (ie, edema).  This is compounded by low serum oncotic pressure due to hypoalbuminemia from liver synthetic dysfunction.  Therefore, despite #increased total body volume#, patients with cirrhosis remain intravascularly depleted and continue to release hypovolemic hormones.  Eventually, the resultant elevated ADH secretion can lead to #hypervolemic hyponatremia#, which is common in patients with advanced cirrhosis. $#(Choices B, C, D, and E)#  Splanchnic vasodilation results in renal hypoperfusion, stimulating increased ADH secretion and activation of the RAAS.  This leads to increased renal resorption of sodium, lowering the urinary sodium concentration.  Third-spacing of fluid results in increased total body volume. $#Educational objective# Portal hypertension in cirrhosis leads to vasodilation and decreased systemic perfusion pressure, which causes antidiuretic hormone release and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, promoting sodium and water retention.  However, due to resistance to splanchnic flow, low oncotic pressure, and hyperdynamic circulation, the fluid is third-spaced into the extravascular compartments (eg, ascites).

The former does not require energy, while the latter utilizes energy from ATP.  In primary active transport, the carrier molecules are enzymes that hydrolyze ATP (ATPases) and use the energy released to transport ions and molecules against their concentration gradients.  Examples of such carriers are the Na/K ATPase, the H/K ATPase, and the Ca ATPase. $Synthesis of HCl by parietal cells of the gastric mucosa is dependent on the H/K ATPase, which is known as a proton pump.  This carrier transports hydrogen ions into the gastric lumen in exchange for potassium ions. $Omeprazole and other proton pump inhibitors inhibit the H/K ATPase, thus decreasing the concentration of HCl in the gastric lumen.  These medications are used for treatment of peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and diseases associated with increased gastrin secretion such as the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. $#(Choice A)#  Tetrodotoxin, a potent neurotoxin found in pufferfish, functions by blocking the voltage-gated sodium channels in nerve cell membranes.

Nearly all of this fluid is reabsorbed from the gastrointestinal lumen by the small intestine epithelium.

Sodium is then transported out of the basolateral end of the enterocyte (sodium/potassium ATPase), which pulls water down its osmotic gradient from the gastrointestinal lumen through the tight junctions between enterocytes and into the lamina propria (and ultimately the bloodstream). $This young patient who recently began going to day care likely has #acute infectious diarrhea# of a viral etiology (eg, rotavirus, norovirus).

Water-insoluble #cholesterol# is secreted in bile, where it is solubilized by detergent-like bile salts and phosphatidylcholine.  If there is more cholesterol than can be dissolved by the bile salts, it will @precipitate@ into insoluble crystals, leading to formation of gallstones.  Risk factors for gallstone formation include obesity or rapid weight loss, female sex, glucose intolerance, and hypomotility of the gallbladder (eg, pregnancy, prolonged fasting). $#Fibrate# medications (eg, fenofibrate, gemfibrozil) upregulate lipoprotein lipase, resulting in increased oxidation of fatty acids.  In addition, fibrates inhibit #cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase#, which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of bile acids.  The reduced bile acid production results in decreased cholesterol solubility in bile and favors the formation of cholesterol stones. $#(Choice A)#  Estrogens increase the biosynthesis of cholesterol by upregulating hepatic HMG-CoA reductase activity.  Estrogenic medications (eg, estrogen replacement therapy, combined oral contraceptives) increase the amount of cholesterol secreted in bile and contribute to formation of gallstones.  Aromatase catalyzes the conversion of androgens to estrogen; inhibition would lead to reduced gallstone formation. $#(Choice B)#  β-glucuronidase is released by damaged hepatocytes and bacteria in infected bile.  It deconjugates bilirubin, and the resulting free bilirubin precipitates with calcium in the bile to form pigmented gallstones.  Decreased activity of this enzyme would reduce the formation of pigmented stones but would not affect the formation of cholesterol gallstones. $#(Choices D and E)#  The first step in cholesterol synthesis is the condensation of 2 molecules of acetyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA acetyl transferase (thiolase) to form acetoacetyl-CoA.  Condensation with a third molecule of acetyl-CoA yields β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA).  HMG-CoA reductase then catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, the rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis.  Decreased activity of these enzymes would reduce cholesterol synthesis and the amount of cholesterol secreted in bile, discouraging cholesterol stone formation. $#Educational objective# Fibrate medications (eg, fenofibrate, gemfibrozil) inhibit cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of bile acids.  The reduced bile acid production results in decreased cholesterol solubility in bile and favors the formation of cholesterol gallstones.  ",

Leptin decreases the production of neuropeptide Y, a potent appetite stimulant, in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus.  $2. Leptin stimulates the production of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) in the arcuate nucleus.

  "explanation_2": "$Folate derivatives are crucial in the synthesis of nucleic acids (particularly thymine), conversion of homocysteine to methionine, and generation of one-carbon carriers (eg, S-adenosylmethionine) for methylation reactions.  All biochemical functions of folate require the reduced #tetrahydrofolate# form of the vitamin, which is synthesized by dihydrofolate reductase (a rate-limiting step in folate metabolism). $The enzyme #thymidylate synthase# is responsible for converting deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) to deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP).  Although most enzymes involved in one-carbon metabolism maintain folate in its active tetrahydrofolate form, thymidylate synthase is unique in that it oxidizes 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to dihydrofolate.  This makes #de novo thymidine synthesis# particularly susceptible to folate-deficient conditions because tetrahydrofolate must be continuously regenerated by dihydrofolate reductase. $In this experiment, inhibition of thymidylate synthase due to #deficient folate# increases the ratio of dUMP to dTMP, causing the incorporation of #uracil into DNA# in place of thymidine.  This leads to excessive activation of DNA repair mechanisms, resulting in double-stranded DNA breaks and apoptosis.  #Thymidine# supplementation reduces the metabolic folate demand, #preventing apoptosis# in folate-deficient cells. $#(Choice A)#  @Cobalamin@ is a necessary cofactor for methionine synthase, the enzyme that transfers a methyl group from 5-methyltetrahydrofolate to homocysteine, forming methionine and regenerating tetrahydrofolate.

Unlike thymine, it is not dependent on folate and can be synthesized in sufficient quantities under folate-deficient conditions. $#(Choice C)#  Glutamine is a major source of nitrogen in the synthesis of purine and pyrimidine bases.  However, glutamine supplementation would not ameliorate the cellular apoptosis induced by folate deficiency. $#(Choice D)#  Homocysteine is an amino acid associated with endothelial cell injury and vascular inflammation.  Levels are elevated in folate deficiency due to impaired conversion into methionine. $#Educational objective# Folate deficiency inhibits the synthesis of nucleic acids, particularly the formation of thymidine.

The pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy is related to increased circulatory levels of #ammonia# and other neurotoxins due to failure of the liver to metabolize waste products. $Under normal conditions, astrocytes regulate neurotransmission by taking up glutamate present in the synapse, preventing excessive neuronal excitation.  Through the action of glutamine synthetase, glutamate undergoes a condensation reaction with ammonia to form glutamine (a non-neuroactive compound).  Glutamine is then released by the astrocytes and taken up by neurons, where it is converted back to glutamate for use as a neurotransmitter (@glutamate-glutamine cycle@). $When #excess ammonia# is present in the blood, it crosses the blood-brain barrier and is taken up by astrocytes, #increasing glutamine production#.  The presence of excess glutamine within astrocytes leads to increased intracellular osmolarity, causing astrocyte swelling and impaired glutamine release.  Hyperammonemia consequently decreases the amount of glutamine available for conversion to glutamate in neurons, resulting in #disruption of excitatory neurotransmission#. $#(Choice A)#  α-ketoglutarate functions as a key intermediate in the TCA cycle and as a nitrogen transporter in metabolic reactions.

It impairs the availability of vitamin B6, which can result in peripheral neuropathy in high risk patients (eg, pregnancy, HIV, diabetes mellitus); anemia (eg, conjunctival pallor) would be unexpected. $#(Choice D)#  Phenytoin, an antiepileptic drug used to treat focal and generalized seizures, may result in folate deficiency and development of megaloblastic anemia.  Phenytoin can also cause peripheral neuropathy, but this adverse effect usually occurs only with chronic therapy (>1 year). $#(Choice E)#  Vitamin D deficiency can develop over several months due to inadequate dietary intake and minimal sunlight exposure.  This deficiency presents as rickets in children and osteomalacia or osteoporosis in adults. $#Educational objective# Vitamin B12 is obtained through the diet solely from animal sources, which places strict vegans at risk for dietary deficiency.  This deficiency takes years to develop due to the large hepatic vitamin B12 reserve, and presents with megaloblastic anemia and potentially irreversible neurologic deficits (eg, paresthesia, weakness, ataxic gait).

Of these, #fructose# is the only one whose metabolites #bypass phosphofructokinase#, one of the key enzymes involved in regulating the rate of glycolysis.  As a result, fructose is metabolized by the liver faster than the other monosaccharides and is rapidly cleared from the bloodstream following dietary absorption. $Metabolism of fructose in the liver begins with phosphorylation by fructokinase to #fructose-1-phosphate (F1P)#.  Aldolase B can use both fructose-1,6-bisphosphate and F1P as substrates; it converts F1P into #dihydroxy acetone phosphate (DHAP)# and #glyceraldehyde#.  Glyceraldehyde can be either phosphorylated to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate by triokinase or converted to DHAP.  DHAP is converted by triose phosphate isomerase to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, which continues down the glycolytic pathway. $#(Choices B, C, D, and E)#  Galactose-1-phosphate, glucose-1-phosphate, glucose-6-phosphate, and mannose-6-phosphate enter glycolysis upstream of phosphofructokinase, a major rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis.  This slows down the rate of their metabolism relative to fructose and its metabolites (eg, F1P). $#Educational objective# Dietary fructose is phosphorylated in the liver to F1P and is rapidly metabolized because it bypasses PFK-1, the major rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis.  Other sugars (eg, glucose, galactose, mannose) enter glycolysis prior to PFK-1 and as a result are metabolized more slowly.  "

  "explanation_2": "$Gallstones can be categorized as cholesterol, pigment, or mixed stones.  Cholesterol stones are formed when the ability of bile salts to solubilize cholesterol is overwhelmed by high concentrations of cholesterol in bile.  Cholesterol stones are yellow to pale gray and hard.  By contrast, #pigment gallstones# are composed of calcium salts of #unconjugated bilirubin#, are comparatively soft, and are dark brown to black. $#Brown# pigment stones typically arise secondary to bacterial (eg, Escherichia coli) or helminthic (eg, Ascaris lumbricoides, Clonorchis sinensis) #infection of the biliary tract#, which results in the release of #beta-glucuronidase# by injured hepatocytes and bacteria.  This enzyme hydrolyzes bilirubin glucuronides and increases the amount of unconjugated bilirubin.  The liver fluke C sinensis is a common cause of pigmented stones in East Asian countries and can have a prolonged quiescent phase before inducing symptoms. $Pigment stones may also occur in the absence of infection when excess bilirubin is excreted, such as with chronic #hemolytic anemia#.  A small amount of conjugated bilirubin normally becomes deconjugated by endogenous beta-glucuronidase in the biliary tract.  When large amounts of conjugated bilirubin are excreted into the bile, enough becomes deconjugated to promote black pigment stone formation. $#(Choice A)#  Inhibition of 7-alpha-hydroxylase (eg, fibrates) reduces the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids and increases the risk of cholesterol stones.  However, this patient's gallstones are composed primarily of unconjugated bilirubin, not cholesterol. $#(Choices B and E)#  Aromatase catalyzes the conversion of androgens to estrogen, which increases hepatic cholesterol uptake.  In addition, estrogens upregulate HMG Co-A reductase, which increases cholesterol synthesis.  This increases biliary excretion of cholesterol, favoring formation of cholesterol stones, not pigment stones. $#(Choice D)#  Desmolase (cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme) catalyzes the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone, which is the first step in the synthesis of steroid hormones. $#Educational objective# Brown pigment gallstones are composed of calcium salts of unconjugated bilirubin and arise secondary to bacterial or helminthic infection of the biliary tract.  Beta-glucuronidase released by injured hepatocytes and bacteria hydrolyzes bilirubin glucuronides to unconjugated bilirubin.

  "explanation_1": "Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by defective DNA mismatch repair.  DNA replication occurs with a high degree of fidelity because mismatched nucleotides are repaired through the proofreading activity of DNA polymerases delta and epsilon.  However, this proofreading functionality is not infallible; base substitutions and small insertion-deletion mismatches occur due to errors in base pairing every 106 bases on average.  It is the function of the DNA mismatch repair system to fix these errors shortly after the daughter strands are synthesized.  The mismatch repair system involves several genes, including MSH2 and MLH1, which code for components of the human MutS and MutL homologs.  Mutations in these 2 genes account for around 90% of cases of Lynch syndrome.$",
  "explanation_2": "$Mismatch repair begins with MutS homolog detecting a mismatch on the newly created daughter strand, which is distinguished from the parent strand by occasional nicks in the phosphodiester bonds.  MutL homolog is then recruited, and the resulting complex slides along the DNA molecule until 1 of the daughter strand nicks is encountered.  At this point, exonuclease 1 is loaded onto and activated by the repair complex.  The daughter strand is then degraded backward past the initial mismatch point, leaving a variable gap of single-stranded DNA that is stabilized by ssDNA-binding protein.  The complex then dissociates while DNA polymerase delta loads at the 3' end of the discontinuity and begins synthesizing a new daughter strand segment.  Finally, DNA ligase I seals the remaining nick to complete the repair process. $#(Choice B)#  Exposure to ultraviolet light can cause pyrimidine (usually thymine) dimers to form due to covalent joining of adjacent pyrimidines.  Pyrimidine dimers interfere with DNA replication and are removed by nucleotide excision repair. $#(Choices C and D)#  Several types of insults can alter the DNA bases.  For example, nitrous acid can deaminate C, A, and G.  There are also spontaneous changes, such as deamination of C to U and the constant low-level loss of purines via thermal disruption.  Glycosylases are enzymes that detect and remove abnormal bases from DNA, creating an empty sugar-phosphate residue that is subsequently removed and replaced by the correct nucleotide (base excision repair). $#(Choice E)#  Exposure to ionizing radiation causes double-stranded DNA breaks that are repaired by end-joining repair mechanisms.  Non-homologous end joining, the main mechanism in primates, is more prone to cause mutations than homologous recombination. $#Educational objective# Lynch syndrome is an autosomal dominant disease caused by abnormal nucleotide mismatch repair.

  "explanation_2": "@Down syndrome (trisomy 21)@ is the most common trisomy in liveborn infants.  The diagnosis is often suspected following abnormal prenatal screening (eg, #increased nuchal translucency# on ultrasound, #decreased maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein# [AFP]) and confirmed by chorionic villous sampling or amniocentesis.  Most cases are caused by maternal meiotic nondisjunction, which results in 3 complete fetal copies of chromosome 21.  The risk for meiotic nondisjunction increases with maternal age, and women age ≥35 are at highest risk. $The most common gastrointestinal abnormality associated with Down syndrome is #duodenal atresia#.  Normally, in early gestation, epithelial proliferation briefly occludes the intestinal lumen and is followed by recanalization.  #Failure# of the duodenal lumen #to recanalize# results in duodenal atresia and intestinal obstruction.  During the first few days of life, infants classically have  bilious emesis, and x-ray findings include the @double bubble sign@, which represents the dilated stomach and proximal duodenum. $Patients with Down syndrome are also at risk for imperforate anus and tracheoesophageal fistula. $#(Choices A and C)#  Trisomies 13 and 18 may be associated with an increased risk for @open neural tube@ and @ventral wall defects@ (eg, omphalocele); trisomy 21 does not carry a similar risk.  Moreover, these defects are associated with elevated AFP in the second trimester, and this patient's low AFP (consistent with trisomy 21) makes the presence of these defects unlikely. $#(Choice D)#  @Pyloric stenosis@ is caused by hypertrophy of the pylorus and presents at age 3-6 weeks with forceful, nonbilious emesis.  Pyloric stenosis is not generally associated with Down syndrome. $#(Choice E)#  @Holoprosencephaly@ is a severe developmental defect of the forebrain (prosencephalon) that is associated with trisomy 13, not trisomy 21. $#Educational objective# Down syndrome (trisomy 21) is associated with decreased maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein and increased nuchal translucency.  Duodenal atresia, the most commonly associated gastrointestinal complication, occurs due to failure of duodenal recanalization in early gestation.  ",

This finding is consistent with a #Meckel diverticulum#, the most common congenital anomaly of the small intestine. $In utero, the midgut lumen and yolk sac cavity normally are connected via the vitelline (omphalomesenteric) duct, which is obliterated in the first trimester.  @Failure of vitelline duct obliteration@ results in a Meckel diverticulum, which is usually located in the ileum within 2 feet of the ileocecal valve.  If symptomatic, a Meckel diverticulum often presents by age 2 (ie, rule of 2s); however, it can cause complications at any age. $Various #ectopic (heterotopic)# tissues (ie, misplaced but functionally normal cells) can be present within a Meckel diverticulum, including gastric, pancreatic, or colonic mucosa.  The most common is gastric tissue, as seen in this patient.  Because #hydrochloric acid# secreted by gastric parietal cells causes ulceration and erosion of adjacent intestinal mucosa, Meckel diverticulum most commonly presents with brisk but painless lower #gastrointestinal bleeding# and #anemia# (eg, fatigue, pallor). $#(Choices A and B)#  Anaplasia refers to poorly differentiated cells that have lost the characteristics of mature tissue, whereas @dysplasia@ refers to disordered growth with loss of cell uniformity.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient has abdominal distension and bilious emesis, findings suggestive of #intestinal obstruction#.  Because the pancreatic and bile ducts join and enter the duodenum at the major duodenal papilla, #bilious emesis# suggests obstruction #distal# to this anatomic location.  Of the options, the only defect that could cause obstruction beyond this site is #annular pancreas,# a rare congenital anomaly that occurs when the ventral pancreatic bud fails to rotate completely in utero. $The ventral pancreatic bud is a foregut derivative that appears by the fifth week of gestation.  It normally rotates behind the duodenum and fuses with the dorsal pancreatic bud during the seventh to eight weeks.  The ventral pancreatic bud gives rise to the uncinate process of the pancreatic head and the main pancreatic duct (of Wirsung).  The pancreatic tail, body, and the remainder of head derive from the dorsal bud. $In patients with annular pancreas, #incomplete ventral bud rotation# results in pancreatic tissue surrounding the second part of the duodenum; the majority of patients with annular pancreas are asymptomatic.  However, in some individuals, the circumferential pancreatic tissue can compress the duodenal lumen, causing obstruction that can be either proximal to the major duodenal papilla (nonbilious emesis) or distal (bilious emesis, as in this patient).  Annular pancreas can also result in obstructed pancreatic drainage (eg, pancreatitis). $#(Choice B)#  Failure of endoderm proliferation as the esophagus is stretched by the rapidly growing heart and liver during the fourth and fifth week of development can cause esophageal atresia (eg, excessive drooling, feeding intolerance immediately after birth).  Bilious emesis does not occur because the obstruction is always proximal to the major duodenal papilla. $#(Choice C)#  Fibrous obliteration of the biliary ducts causes biliary atresia, and patients often develop jaundice and acholic stools in the first 2 months of life due to biliary obstruction.  Signs and symptoms of intestinal obstruction would not be expected. $#(Choice D)#  Hypertrophy of the pyloric muscle causes pyloric stenosis.  Unlike this patient's bilious emesis, pyloric stenosis causes nonbilious emesis in the first 3-6 months of life due to gastric outlet obstruction (ie, proximal to the major duodenal papilla). $#(Choice E)#  Incomplete obliteration of the allantois (connects the bladder to the umbilicus in utero) leads to a @patent urachus@ or urachal cyst.  Patients have increased risk for urinary tract infections, and young infants may have vomiting and irritability, but bilious emesis would not be present and persistent umbilical discharge is typical. $#Educational objective# Annular pancreas (ie, pancreatic tissue encircling the duodenum) is caused by abnormal rotation of the ventral pancreatic bud in utero.  Although frequently asymptomatic, it can cause intestinal obstruction (eg, vomiting, abdominal distension), including bilious emesis if the constriction is distal to the major duodenal papilla.  ",

  "explanation_2": "This patient with painless rectal bleeding has imaging findings consistent with a #Meckel diverticulum#, a congenital intestinal abnormality that results from failed obliteration of the #vitelline (omphalomesenteric) duct#.  The @vitelline duct@ is an embryologic remnant that connects the yolk sac to the primitive midgut, and duct closure normally occurs in early gestation.  Incomplete closure results in an ileal outpouching with a fibrous connection to the umbilicus. $Meckel diverticulum often contains heterotopic #gastric mucosa#.  Secretion of hydrochloric acid by gastric parietal cells causes ulceration and bleeding of local small bowel, resulting in typical findings of #painless lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding# and #anemia#, as seen in this patient.  Less commonly, Meckel diverticulum can present with acute abdominal pain; for example, it can serve as a lead point for intussusception, causing colicky pain and currant jelly stools.  Although presentation of Meckel diverticulum is most common at age <2, it can occur at any age. $Diagnosis is made with @99mTc-pertechnetate scan@ (ie, Meckel scan).

Arrest of hindgut descent in utero leads to an imperforate anus, which presents in neonates with failure to pass stool, not painless rectal bleeding. $#(Choices B and C)#  Failure of craniocaudal neural crest cell migration results in an aganglionic sigmoid colon/rectum that is narrow and inactive (ie, @Hirschsprung disease@), and disrupted vascular flow to the ileum results in ileal atresia.  Both conditions typically manifest with signs of obstruction (eg, abdominal distension, bilious emesis, failure to pass meconium) in a neonate, not painless GI bleeding in a 4-year-old. $#(Choice E)#  Abnormal midgut rotation around the superior mesenteric artery describes intestinal malrotation.

In a neonate, causes include malrotation/volvulus, small intestine atresia, and colon disorders (eg, Hirschsprung disease); less commonly, extrinsic compression of the bowel (eg, annular pancreas) can occur.  In this case, the patient has a blind-ending jejunum and parts of the distal small intestine are absent, confirming #intestinal atresia#. $The pathophysiology of intestinal atresia varies based on the segment of bowel involved.  In @duodenal atresia@, the mechanism involves failure of the lumen to recanalize after epithelial proliferation in the first trimester #(choice D).#  In contrast, intestinal atresia of the #midgut# (eg, jejunum, ileum, proximal colon) is the result of #vascular occlusion# in utero.  Risk factors include underlying intestinal abnormality (eg, gastroschisis) or maternal use of vasoconstrictive drugs or substances (eg, nicotine). $Compromised perfusion leads to ischemia of a bowel segment, with subsequent narrowing (stenosis) or obliteration (atresia) of the lumen.  This patient most likely developed occlusion of the #superior mesenteric artery#, resulting in ischemia, necrosis, and resorption of the distal small bowel associated with the dorsal mesentery.  The jejunum proximal to the ischemic segment ends in a blind pouch, and the ileum distal to the segment spirals around the ileocolic vessel that perfuses it (@apple peel@ atresia). $#(Choice A)#  Amniotic band constriction occurs when fibrous bands in the amniotic sac constrict otherwise normally growing structures (eg, limbs), causing @constriction rings@ or amputation.  Internal structures such as the developing intestine are not affected. $#(Choice B)#  @Hirschsprung disease@ results from failure of neural crest cell migration to the distal colon.  The absence of submucosal and myenteric plexi leads to an aganglionic colon segment and symptoms of functional obstruction (eg, bilious emesis, abdominal distension) with delayed passage of meconium.  However, unlike this case, the small intestine is unaffected. $#(Choice C)#  Failure of the tracheoesophageal septum to partition the foregut into the esophagus and the trachea in early gestation leads to @tracheoesophageal fistula@.

  "explanation_2": "$At 4-8 weeks gestation, the midgut (supplied by the superior mesenteric artery) herniates through the umbilical ring while undergoing rapid growth that the embryonic abdominal cavity cannot accommodate.  During this process, the @midgut rotates@ 90 degrees counterclockwise.  The midgut returns to the abdominal cavity at 8-10 weeks gestation and turns an additional 180 degrees (#270 degrees counterclockwise# total).  The intestines are then fixed to the parietal peritoneum of the posterior abdominal wall on a wide-based mesentery (extending from the duodenojejunal flexure in the left upper quadrant to the cecum in the right lower quadrant). $Incomplete rotation results in #midgut malrotation#.  In these patients, the duodenojejunal flexure and cecum both rest in the right upper quadrant, and #fibrous (Ladd) bands# connect the cecum to the retroperitoneum by passing over the second part of the duodenum.  These bands of tissue can #compress the duodenum#, leading to symptoms of #intestinal obstruction# in the newborn, as seen in this patient with bilious emesis and abdominal distension. $Midgut malrotation also results in a narrow mesenteric base that is vulnerable to twisting around the superior mesenteric artery, resulting in midgut @volvulus@.  Volvulus, which can also cause bilious emesis in the newborn period, may compromise intestinal perfusion and lead to life-threatening bowel ischemia and necrosis. $#(Choice A)#  Failure of ventral and dorsal pancreatic bud fusion results in pancreas divisum.  This condition is usually asymptomatic and an incidental finding on imaging or autopsy. $#(Choice C)#  Failure of neural crest cell migration causes @Hirschsprung disease@.  The aganglionic colon segment cannot relax and is therefore narrow and obstructive.  Neonates with this abnormality can develop bilious emesis, but delayed passage of meconium is typical (not seen here).  In addition, this patient has fibrous bands compressing the duodenum, a finding inconsistent with the diagnosis of Hirschsprung disease. $#(Choice D)#  The omphalomesenteric duct connects the midgut lumen with the yolk sac.  Failed obliteration of the duct can lead to @Meckel diverticulum@, which most commonly presents with painless lower gastrointestinal bleeding.  Emesis is not typical, and Ladd bands would not be seen. $#(Choice E)#  Failure of gut recanalization describes @duodenal atresia@.  Although patients with duodenal atresia may present with bilious emesis in the neonatal period, Ladd bands would not be present. $#Educational objective# Intestinal malrotation occurs when the midgut undergoes incomplete counterclockwise rotation during embryologic development.

Meckel diverticulum is typically located in the small bowel 2 feet from the ileocecal valve and, if symptomatic, often presents by age 2 (ie, rule of 2s); however, it can cause complications at any age. $Meckel diverticulum is a #true diverticulum#, consisting of all 3 layers of the intestinal wall: #mucosa, submucosa, and muscularis#.  It often contains heterotopic gastric mucosa, which secretes hydrochloric acid and leads to the classic presentation of painless lower gastrointestinal bleeding (#hematochezia#) due to the ulceration of adjacent intestine.  Patients may also develop #diverticular inflammation# with signs of acute intestinal obstruction (eg, abdominal pain, guarding, bilious emesis), as seen in this patient.  Other complications of a Meckel diverticulum can include intussusception, volvulus, and bowel perforation. $#(Choice A)#  Fibrous scar tissue, which can be present postoperatively or due to chronic inflammation, can cause intestinal obstruction with severe abdominal pain, bilious emesis, and guarding.  However, a blind pouch connected to the ileum with an attachment to the umbilicus would not be present. $#(Choice B)#  Granulation tissue is new connective tissue that forms in response to wound healing, and the peritoneum is the lining of the abdominal cavity.  These tissues are not contained in a Meckel diverticulum. $#(Choice C)#  False diverticula contain only mucosa and submucosa.  These layers herniate through defects in the muscular layer.  Colonic and Zenker (upper esophageal) diverticula are examples of false diverticula. $#(Choice D)#  Tumors of the omentum (ie, adipose tissue covering the abdominal organs) are a rare cause of abdominal pain and vomiting but are not associated with an outpouching of the ileum. $#Educational objective# Meckel diverticulum, which classically causes painless hematochezia but can present with acute abdominal pain if inflamed (ie, diverticulitis), is an anatomic connection between the ileum and umbilicus resulting from incomplete obliteration of the vitelline duct.  This congenital anomaly is a true diverticulum, consisting of all 3 layers of the intestinal wall (mucosa, submucosa, and muscularis).  "

These parasympathetic ganglia are responsible for intestinal peristalsis.  Neural crest cells enter the developing foregut mesenchyme and then #migrate caudally# along the entire length of the bowel; they are present in the wall of proximal colon by the 8th week of gestation and in the rectum by the 12th week. $The #arrest of migration# of neural crest cells causes #Hirschsprung disease#, in which a distal segment of colon @lacks ganglion cells@.  Because neural crest cells migrate caudally, the #rectum is always involved#.  The absence of parasympathetic ganglia in the colonic wall causes the affected segment to be narrowed because it cannot relax.  The passage of intestinal contents through this area is difficult, and compensatory dilation of the proximal colon occurs. $Newborns with Hirschsprung disease often #fail to pass meconium# within 48 hours of birth.  They may also develop signs of intestinal obstruction, such as bilious vomiting and abdominal distension.  The bowel is filled with stool, but the rectum is empty; anal sphincter tone is usually increased. $#(Choice A)#  Degeneration of neural crest cells forming the myenteric plexus in the esophagus causes achalasia (ie, esophageal dilation with absent peristalsis).  However, the condition is most often due to autoimmune destruction of mature neurons; failed neural crest migration is a very rare etiology. $#(Choices B, C, D, E, and F)#  Although total colonic aganglionosis can occur, the cecum and transverse colon are not commonly involved in Hirschsprung disease.  Total intestinal aganglionosis (eg, duodenum, jejunum, ileum) has also been described but is extremely rare.  The rectum is most likely to be affected by a problem with neural crest cell migration, as it is at the very end of the migration path. $#Educational objective# Hirschsprung disease is caused by abnormal migration of neural crest cells (ganglion cell precursors) during embryogenesis.

  "explanation_2": "This patient's abdominal examination is consistent with a @congenital umbilical hernia@.  Normally, the umbilical ring (ie, the congenital fascial opening for the umbilical cord) closes and forms the linea alba, a midline band of fibrous tissue.  #Umbilical hernias# are caused by an #incomplete closure of the umbilical ring#, thereby allowing protrusion of bowel through the abdominal musculature.  This generally benign condition is often an isolated defect, but patients with certain genetic conditions are more likely to develop an umbilical hernia, as in this newborn with features consistent with @Down syndrome@ (eg, palpebral fissures, epicanthal folds, single palmar crease). $Almost all congenital umbilical hernias are #reducible# and #asymptomatic#.  They often appear larger and more prominent with increased abdominal pressure (eg, crying).  Incarceration and strangulation are very rare. $Most umbilical hernias #resolve spontaneously# in the first few years of life as the fascial layers fuse. $#(Choice A)#  During midgut development in the first trimester, the abdominal contents undergo physiologic herniation, followed by a rotation of the midgut and physiologic reduction.  Failure of this reduction may contribute to @omphalocele@, which presents as a midline herniation of abdominal contents contained within a thin, membranous sac.  It is not covered by skin, in contrast to this patient. $#(Choice C)#  Midgut development in the first trimester involves a physiologic occlusion of the intestinal lumen followed by recanalization.  Failure of recanalization results in duodenal atresia, which is associated with Down syndrome.  However, symptoms include vomiting, often bilious, in the first 24 hours of life. $#(Choice D)#  Malrotation results from an incomplete rotation of the midgut prior to physiologic reduction into the abdominal cavity; malrotation alone is asymptomatic.  Its main complication is volvulus (intestinal torsion), which results in bowel ischemia and necrosis from constriction of the blood supply.  In contrast to this patient, volvulus typically presents with bilious emesis in the first month of life. $#(Choice E)#  Congenital inguinal hernias develop when the processus vaginalis, an outpouching of the peritoneum, fails to obliterate, allowing bowel contents into the inguinal canal.  Inguinal hernias are more prominent with increased abdominal pressure, but they present as a mass in the groin, not the umbilicus. $#Educational objective# Umbilical hernias are caused by a defect in the linea alba and present as protrusions at the umbilicus that are soft, reducible, and benign.

  "explanation_2": "$#Celiac disease# is a chronic malabsorptive disorder caused by a #hypersensitivity to gluten#, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye.  Gliadin (a gluten component) triggers an immune-mediated reaction causing #villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia#, and @intraepithelial lymphocyte infiltration@.  Normal intestinal villi allow for increased small intestinal surface area to begin the process of digestion and nutrient absorption.  The atrophy in celiac disease causes impairment of nutrient absorption in the duodenum and proximal jejunum, regions where the concentration of gluten is the highest. $Classic celiac disease presents after introduction of gluten into the diet (between age 6-24 months) with symptoms of malabsorption (eg, diarrhea, steatorrhea, flatulence, nutrient deficiencies, weight loss).  Other manifestations include delayed puberty and short stature in children and anemia in adults.  Screening is with serology testing for elevated IgA anti-endomysial and #anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies#; diagnosis is confirmed by endoscopic biopsy.  With strict adherence to a #gluten-free diet#, symptom resolution occurs within weeks and is followed by normalization of histology and antibody levels. $#(Choice A)#  Mild gastroesophageal reflux is physiologic in healthy infants, but it can lead to irritability, poor feeding, and inadequate weight gain when severe.  The diagnosis is often made clinically and can be treated with conservative changes (eg, smaller feedings) and acid suppression (eg, proton pump inhibitor).  Refractory cases may require biopsy, which shows esophageal inflammation. $#(Choice B)#  Anti-inflammatory medications (eg, glucocorticoids, aminosalicylates) are the mainstay of treatment for inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis [UC] and Crohn disease [CD]).  Symptoms include abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and weight loss.  Colonoscopy may show diffuse colonic inflammation in UC and focal areas of small intestinal and colonic inflammation in CD. $#(Choice C)#  Tropical sprue can occur with extended travel to the tropics and presents with chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, and flatulence along with similar histologic findings to celiac disease (eg, villous atrophy).  The etiology is likely infectious, and the disease is treated with antibiotics.  However, this patient has no history of travel. $#(Choices D and E)#  Lactase supplementation or limited lactose intake is recommended for patients with lactose intolerance, which classically presents in older children and adults with bloating, flatulence, abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea.  Although biopsy is not indicated for diagnosis, histology would show normal small intestinal architecture with decreased lactase activity. $#Educational objective# Celiac disease (gluten-sensitive enteropathy) classically presents between age 6-24 months with abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and weight loss.  Duodenal biopsy reveals crypt hyperplasia, villous atrophy, and intraepithelial lymphocyte infiltration.  Treatment with a gluten-free diet resolves symptoms and normalizes serology and histology.
