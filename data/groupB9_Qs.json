    "explanation_2": "$This patient's presentation is consistent with ulnar neuropathy.  The #ulnar nerve# is a branch of the medial cord of the @brachial plexus@.  It enters the forearm after passing behind the medial epicondyle of the humerus.  Within the @forearm@, it innervates the flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU) and the medial portion of the flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) before entering the wrist between the #hook of the hamate# and the pisiform bone in a fibroosseous tunnel known as #Guyon canal#.  Here, it divides into a superficial branch that provides #sensation# to the #medial 1½ digits# and a deep motor branch that supplies most of the intrinsic muscles of the hand. $The ulnar nerve is commonly injured by trauma or nerve compression at the elbow (funny bone) or at Guyon canal (eg, striking the ground during a fall). $• Injury at Guyon canal causes sensory loss in the medial 1½ digits along with intrinsic hand weakness.  The #hypothenar eminence# can appear flattened due to #atrophy# of denervated muscles.  Weakness of the lumbricals in the fourth/fifth digits may also produce an @ulnar claw@ appearance during finger extension. $• Injury at the elbow will cause similar symptoms along with sensory loss in the @hypothenar eminence@ (palmar cutaneous branch) and medial dorsum of the hand (dorsal cutaneous branch).  Weakness on wrist flexion/adduction (FCU) and flexion of the fourth/fifth digits (medial portion of FDP) may also be present. $#(Choice A)#  Carpal tunnel syndrome can result from any condition that reduces the size of the carpal tunnel (eg, pregnancy, hypothyroidism).

    "explanation_2": "$The #anterior cruciate ligament# (ACL) originates on the lateral femoral condyle and courses anteriorly and medially to insert on the anterior intercondylar area of the tibia.  The primary function of the ACL is to #prevent anterior motion# of the tibia with respect to the femur, although it also plays a role in stabilizing the knee against rotatory and varus/valgus forces. $The ACL is most commonly ruptured in noncontact sports that involve sudden changes in direction or excessive internal rotation or lateral (valgus) bending forces when landing from a jump.  The middle geniculate artery provides the primary blood supply to the ACL, and injuries are characterized by rapid-onset #hemarthrosis# and knee swelling.  In addition to the effusion, examination typically shows #anterior laxity# of the tibia relative to the femur @(eg, Lachman test, anterior drawer test)@. $#(Choices B and F)#  The @tibial (medial) collateral ligament@ is most commonly injured by impacts to the lateral knee.  The fibular (lateral) collateral ligament is only rarely injured but may be injured by a forceful blow to the medial knee while the leg is extended.  Injury to these ligaments is characterized by laxity of valgus or varus stress, respectively. $#(Choice C)#  The oblique popliteal ligament is a wide, fibrous band that connects the posterior distal femur to the posterior proximal tibia.  It has small openings for nerves, vessels, and muscle insertions.  Injury would allow laxity of knee hyperextension. $#(Choice D)#  The patellar ligament (tendon) is a very robust structure that represents the inferior projection of the quadriceps femoris tendon.  Injury causes impaired knee extension. $#(Choice E)#  The @posterior cruciate ligament@ extends from the medial condyle of the femur to the posterior head of the tibia.  Injury causes laxity of posterior movement of the tibia with respect to the femur (eg, posterior drawer test). $#Educational objective# The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) can be damaged by sudden changes in direction or awkward landings (eg, excessive internal rotation or valgus stress) during sports activity.  ACL tears are typically associated with rapid-onset hemarthrosis.  Physical examination shows anterior laxity of the tibia relative to the femur (eg, Lachman test, anterior drawer test).  ",

Treatment can be with vagal stimulation, such as carotid sinus massage or the Valsalva maneuver. Maneuvers that increase vagal tone increase the refractory period in the AV node and help prevent a reentrant circuit from conducting. If Valsalva measures fail, intravenous administration of adenosine is recommended.$The Valsalva maneuver is executed by forcibly exhaling against a closed glottis. This is done by taking a full inhalation, closing the glottis (i.e. holding one's breath), and subsequently bearing down-without exhaling-as one would during a bowel movement. The rectus muscles are recruited in this process, and they #(choice A)# play the largest role in the development of the resultant elevated intraabdominal and intrathoracic pressure during this maneuver.$(Choice B) This structure is the iliacus muscle, a flexor of the hip that lies over the iliac fossa.$(Choice C) This structure is the gluteus minimus muscle. This muscle is innervated by the superior gluteal nerve and has the subtle, but important function of preventing the contralateral (non-weight-bearing) side of the pelvis from dipping when that leg is elevated off of the ground, as when one walks.$(Choice D) This structure is the gluteus medius muscle. This muscle has the same innervation and function as the gluteus minimus.$(Choice E) This structure is the gluteus maximus muscle. This muscle is innervated by the inferior gluteal nerve and is the major extensor of the thigh at the hip.$Educational objective The Valsalva maneuver increases vagal tone and can be used to abolish paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.

The patella is a large sesamoid bone that facilitates knee extension, protects the joint from direct injury, and improves nourishment of the distal femur articular cartilage.  The quadriceps tendon inserts at the superior pole of the patella and wraps distally around the patella to become the patellar tendon, which inserts at the tibial tuberosity. $Patella fractures are most commonly due to a #direct blow# to the #anterior aspect# of the knee (eg, landing on a flexed knee in a fall, striking the knee against the dashboard in a frontal motor vehicle collision).  The patella can also be fractured indirectly due to excessive force transmitted through the quadriceps tendon (eg, landing on the feet after falling from a height).  Patients develop acute swelling (often with an associated effusion), focal tenderness, #inability to extend the knee# against gravity, and a #palpable gap# in the extensor mechanism. $#(Choice A)#  The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) protects against excessive posterior knee movement and is the least frequently injured knee ligament.  PCL injury results in a positive posterior drawer test (increased backward movement of the tibia against a fixed femur). $#(Choice B)#  The medial collateral ligament (MCL) protects against valgus stress on the knee and excessive external tibial rotation.  MCL injury occurs after a @lateral blow to the knee@ or indirect stress from excessive lower leg rotation or abduction.  Patients have excessive joint widening on valgus stress (eg, the femur is held in a fixed position while an abducting [lateral] force is applied to the lower leg/foot). $#(Choice C)#  The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) controls anterior knee movement and prevents excessive tibial rotation.  ACL injury often occurs due to sudden acceleration or deceleration in noncontact athletic injuries.

Hamstring injury can decrease hip extension and knee flexion.  However, these muscles do not involve the patella. $#Educational objective# Patella fractures are most commonly due to a direct impact to the anterior aspect of the knee.

The #glenohumeral joint# is the most commonly #dislocated# joint in the body due to the shallow articulation between the humeral head and the glenoid fossa of the scapula.  The humeral head may dislocate anteriorly, inferiorly, or posteriorly, but anterior dislocations are by far the most common. $#Anterior shoulder dislocations# classically follow a blow to an externally rotated and abducted arm (eg, throwing a football).  Common @examination findings@ include #flattening of the deltoid# prominence, protrusion of the acromion, and anterior axillary fullness (due to the humeral head's movement into this location).  The #axillary nerve# is the nerve most commonly #injured# by anterior shoulder dislocations.  It innervates the deltoid and teres minor muscles and provides @sensory innervation@ to the skin overlying the lateral shoulder. $Shoulder dislocations are diagnosed on plain x-ray and are treated with prompt closed reduction, which typically improves the axillary neuropathy. $#(Choice A)#  Acromioclavicular joint subluxation typically results from a downward blow to the tip of the shoulder and produces swelling and upward displacement of the clavicle.  It is usually not associated with specific nerve injuries/deficits. $#(Choice C)#  Clavicular fractures usually occur following direct trauma to the clavicle.  Most fractures are in the middle third of the clavicle and produce local swelling and tenderness.  Associated neurovascular damage is rare. $#(Choice D)#  Fracture of the coracoid process of the scapula is rare.  Individuals who engage in shotgun- or rifle-related activities are most commonly affected. $#(Choice E)#  Rotator cuff tears may occur during shoulder dislocation but do not cause nerve injury.  The @rotator cuff@ is made up of the subscapularis, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor muscles/tendons. $#(Choice F)#  A spiral fracture of the midshaft humerus may result from torsion produced during a fall on an outstretched arm.  Patients have swelling, bone crepitus, and ecchymoses of the arm.  The @radial nerve@ is commonly injured. $#Educational objective# Flattening of the deltoid muscle with acromial prominence after a shoulder injury suggests an anterior humerus dislocation.  This injury most commonly results from a blow to an externally rotated and abducted arm.  There is often associated axillary nerve injury, resulting in deltoid paralysis and loss of sensation over the lateral shoulder.  ",

Although femoral neck stress fracture can cause chronic groin pain, MRI would show edema and a linear hypointense focus in the femoral neck (not femoral head). $#(Choice E)#  Acetabular @labral tear@ occasionally presents as chronic groin pain, although acute posttraumatic pain is more common in young patients.  However, unenhanced MRI typically shows only subtle findings, and the femoral heads are usually normal and symmetric. $#Educational objective# Osteonecrosis of the femoral head typically presents with pain in the groin, thigh, or buttock that is worse with activity.  Early in the course of disease, plain x-rays are often normal; MRI is more sensitive.  T1-weighted images show decreased intensity in diseased bone with serpiginous low-intensity lines.  ",

    "explanation_2": "$#Supracondylar humeral fractures# are common pediatric elbow fractures that characteristically occur after hyperextension injuries (eg, falling onto an outstretched arm).  These fractures carry a significant risk for neurovascular compromise, especially if the fragments are displaced.

    "explanation_2": "$The #tibial nerve# is the large medial branch of the sciatic nerve and descends through the popliteal fossa together with the popliteal vein and artery.  It then traverses the posterior compartment of the leg deep to the soleus muscle.  After providing motor innervation to the posterior compartment muscles, the nerve enters the plantar aspect of the foot through the tarsal tunnel (between the flexor retinaculum and medial surfaces of the talus and calcaneus).  Here, it divides into the medial and lateral plantar nerves, providing #sensory# innervation over the #sole# of the foot and motor innervation to the intrinsic foot muscles. $Injury to the nerve at the popliteal fossa (eg, deep penetrating trauma, knee surgery) can cause weakness on #foot plantarflexion# because the nerve innervates the gastrocnemius, soleus, and plantaris muscles.  Weakness may also be evident on foot #inversion# (eg, tibialis posterior muscle) and #toe flexion# (eg, flexor digitorum longus and flexor hallucis longus muscles).  Consequently, patients often present with the foot held in a calcaneovalgus position (eg, dorsiflexed and everted).  In contrast, injury to the tibial nerve at the tarsal tunnel may cause sensory loss over the sole with intrinsic foot muscle weakness.

    "explanation_2": "$This patient's upper extremity neurologic symptoms in the setting of an extra rib are highly suggestive of #thoracic outlet syndrome# (TOS).  The thoracic outlet refers to the region above the first rib and behind the clavicle that is bordered by the cervical vertebral bones and the sternum.  #Compression# of the #brachial plexus# as it passes through the thoracic outlet can cause upper extremity numbness, tingling, and weakness (most often in an ulnar distribution due to compression of the lower trunk).  Involvement of the #subclavian vein and artery# can also occur and lead to upper extremity swelling and exertional arm pain. $TOS most commonly occurs due to compression of the brachial plexus within the #scalene triangle#, which is formed by the anterior and middle scalene muscles and the first rib.  The anterior scalene muscle originates from the C3-C6 transverse processes and attaches to the scalene tubercle of the first rib.  The middle scalene originates from the C2-C7 transverse processes and inserts into the posterior portion of the first rib.  The brachial plexus trunks and subclavian artery pass between the anterior and middle scalenes; the subclavian vein runs anterior to the anterior scalene. $The presence of an #anomalous cervical rib# or scalene muscular anomalies can predispose to TOS.  Affected patients typically have a history of trauma or repetitive overhead arm movements (eg, swimming, stacking boxes). $#(Choice A)#  The @coracobrachialis@ originates from the coracoid process of the scapula and acts to flex the arm at the glenohumeral joint.  The musculocutaneous nerve pierces the muscle near its insertion into the humerus; overuse of the coracobrachialis (eg, excessive bench pressing) can cause entrapment of the musculocutaneous nerve, causing impaired elbow flexion and lateral forearm sensory loss. $#(Choice C)#  The @subscapularis muscle@ originates in the subscapular fossa of the scapula and inserts into the lesser tubercle of the humerus.  It acts to adduct and internally rotate the humerus. $#(Choices D and E)#  The teres major muscle and long head of the triceps brachii form the inferior and medial borders of the @quadrangular space@ through which the axillary nerve passes.  Entrapment of the axillary nerve within the quadrangular space can cause sensory loss over the lateral shoulder and impair shoulder abduction. $#Educational objective# Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is most often caused by compression of the brachial plexus as it passes through the scalene triangle, the space bordered by the anterior and middle scalene muscles and the first rib.

After coursing around the posterolateral head and lateral neck of the fibula, the common fibular nerve divides into superficial and deep branches: $• The superficial branch innervates the muscles of the lateral compartment of the leg, which function primarily to #evert# the foot.  It also provides sensory innervation to the #dorsum of the foot.# $• The deep branch innervates the muscles of the anterior compartment of the leg, which act mainly as #dorsiflexors# of the foot and toes.

The semitendinosus and semimembranosus originate at the ischial tuberosity and insert at the medial tibia.  Together, the hamstrings are responsible for #hip extension# and #knee flexion#. $Hamstring #injury# most often occurs during #deceleration#, when muscles contract eccentrically (ie, lengthen) to slow the lower extremity.

On examination, active hip extension and knee flexion are frequently limited due to pain, and an antalgic gait (ie, limp) is commonly present. $#(Choice B)#  The @gluteus maximus@ originates from multiple sites on the ilium, dorsal sacrum, coccyx, and sacrotuberous ligament; it inserts on the gluteal tuberosity of the femur.  Injury would affect active hip extension but would not affect knee flexion. $#(Choice C)#  The gluteus minimus originates from the lower gluteal surface of the ilium and inserts on the greater trochanter of the femur.

Iliopsoas injury or irritation (eg, abscess) causes pain with active hip flexion (vs extension); knee movement is not affected because the iliopsoas does not cross the knee joint. $#(Choice E)#  The rectus femoris originates at the ilium and joins with the other quadriceps muscles to form the quadriceps tendon, which inserts on the patella.  Injury to the rectus femoris results in pain or difficulty with active hip flexion (vs extension) and knee extension (vs flexion). $#Educational objective# The hamstrings are composed of the biceps femoris (long and short heads), semitendinosus, and semimembranosus.

The quadriceps is responsible for leg extension at the knee and inserts into the #tibial tubercle# via the patellar ligament.  The tubercle forms as a #secondary ossification center# (apophysis) of the tibia, and the cartilaginous nature of the developing tibial tuberosity in childhood makes it more prone to injury compared to the fully ossified bone in adults. $OSD most commonly occurs after a #growth spurt# due to increased tension in tendons and ligaments caused by the rapidly elongating bone.  Repetitive quadriceps contraction (eg, sports activity) then results in chronic avulsion of the tibial tubercle.  Clinical findings include tenderness and swelling at the tibial tubercle and pain that #worsens with knee extension# (eg, jumping).  Imaging frequently shows an elevated and fragmented @tibial tubercle@. $#(Choice A)#  The anterior intercondylar area (ie, fossa) is the space between the medial and lateral condyles of the tibia.  The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) attaches at this specific location and is crucial for knee stabilization.  @ACL injury@ typically results from sudden deceleration with direction change and presents as acute knee pain, swelling, and instability that prevents weight-bearing. $#(Choice B)#  The sartorius muscle is the longest muscle in the body.  It originates from the anterior superior iliac spine and inserts with the @pes anserinus@ onto the anteromedial tibia shaft near the tibial tuberosity.  Pes anserinus bursitis commonly occurs in runners and causes anteromedial knee pain. $#(Choices C and D)#  The tendon of the biceps femoris (part of the hamstrings) inserts at the styloid process of the head of the fibula.  The medial condyle of the tibia is the insertion site for the semimembranous muscle, the most medial of the hamstring muscles.  The hamstring muscles are involved in knee flexion and hip extension. $#Educational objective# The quadriceps muscle group is connected to the patella, which is attached to the tibial tubercle by the patellar ligament.

Older children often have focal bony tenderness, but children age ≤2 may be unable to localize pain.  Passive range of motion of the joints typically is normal and helps distinguish osteomyelitis from septic arthritis. $The most common cause of osteomyelitis in #children# is #hematogenous spread# of bacteria, which may be introduced by minor (often unnoticed) trauma to a distant site.  Infection in children classically occurs in the #metaphyses# of #long bones# (eg, femur, tibia) because this region is highly vascular yet contains #slow-flowing sinusoids# that are conducive to bacterial seeding.  Bacterial seeding within the metaphysis initially causes #acute inflammation# of the bone marrow, with focal hyperperfusion and #increased radiotracer uptake# within the affected region. $Persistent inflammation within the confined bony space leads to increased intramedullary pressure, which compromises blood flow and forces infectious exudate into the cortex and periosteum.  Without treatment, the infection can progress to chronic suppurative osteomyelitis, in which necrotic bone (ie, sequestrum) serves as an infectious reservoir and sinus tracts develop to drain away the purulent material. $#(Choice A)#  Osteomyelitis of flat bones (eg, skull, pelvis) is uncommon in children and is typically caused by contiguous spread of infection (eg, open wound, dental abscess).  Although pelvic bone involvement may lead to refusal to bear weight, this patient has no gross abnormality of the hips or lower extremities suggesting adjacent soft tissue infection. $#(Choice B)#  Ewing sarcoma typically arises in diaphysis of the long bones, especially the femur.  It is the second most common malignant bone tumor in children after osteosarcoma.  However, Ewing sarcoma typically presents in children age >10 with an insidious onset of progressive pain, not in toddlers with acute refusal to bear weight. $#(Choice C)#  The physis (growth plate) in children limits vascular connections between the metaphysis and epiphysis, which is relatively less vascularized, making epiphyseal involvement uncommon in hematogenous osteomyelitis.  Although avascular necrosis of the proximal femoral epiphysis (eg, Legg-Calve-Perthes) can present with a limp, the pain is typically more mild and develops gradually without fever. $#(Choice E)#  Hematogenous osteomyelitis in adults occurs more commonly in the vertebral bodies due to increasing vertebral vascularity with age as well as epiphyseal closure during puberty (improves capillary flow within the metaphyses of long bones). $#Educational objective# Hematogenous osteomyelitis occurs most commonly in children.  It usually affects the metaphysis of long bones due to the presence of slow-flowing sinusoids that are conducive to bacterial seeding.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient has a fragility fracture (ie, due to low-intensity trauma that would not cause a fracture in normal bone).  In light of her age and post-menopausal status, this is likely due to #osteoporosis#.  After menopause, declining estrogen levels accelerate the loss of bone mass with a decrease in osteoblastic and an increase in osteoclastic activity.  Other common risk factors include low body weight, smoking, heavy alcohol intake, and sedentary lifestyle. $The 2 major types of bone are trabecular (also called cancellous or spongy bone) and cortical.  #Trabecular bone# composes only 15% of the skeleton by weight but is metabolically more active due to its large surface area.  Initially following menopause, bone loss predominantly affects trabecular bone, especially in the dorsolumbar vertebral bodies.  Morphologic characteristics include #trabecular thinning# and perforation with #loss of interconnecting bridges#.  With continued aging, cortical bone, which composes most of the appendicular skeleton, also becomes involved.  The neck of the femur has components of both trabecular and cortical bone, and is a common site of osteoporotic fracture. $#(Choice A)#  Paget disease of bone is caused by defective osteoid formation and increased bone remodeling.  Collagen is laid down in a haphazard manner, resulting in a mosaic pattern of bone with irregular sections of lamellar bone linked by prominent cement lines.  Paget disease typically presents with bone pain and deformity with osteolytic or mixed lytic/sclerotic lesions on x-ray. $#(Choice B)#  Osteomalacia is commonly due to vitamin D deficiency, and is characterized by unmineralized osteoid deposits on trabecular surfaces.  The bone is weak and prone to fracture, but symptomatic patients typically have bone pain, muscle weakness, and impaired ambulation. $#(Choice C)#  Osteopetrosis is a group of disorders characterized by impaired osteoclast function.  This leads to persistence of the primary spongiosa in the medullary cavity.  These rare disorders typically present early in life with fractures, deformities, and hematologic cytopenias (due to obliteration of the marrow space). $#(Choice D)#  Bone disease in hyperparathyroidism is characterized by increased bone resorption in cortical bone with subperiosteal thinning and cystic degeneration (osteitis fibrosa cystica).  However, this is typically seen in advanced cases along with diffuse bone pain and manifestations of hypercalcemia (eg, constipation, neuropsychiatric symptoms). $#Educational objective# Initially in osteoporosis, bone loss predominantly affects trabecular bone, leading to trabecular thinning and perforation with loss of interconnecting bridges.

  "explanation_2": "$This older patient with multifocal bone pain has enlarged vertebral bodies with cortical thickening on imaging, which is consistent with #Paget disease of bone# (PD).  PD is characterized by #excessive and disordered bone formation#.  It commonly affects the skull, long bones of the extremities, and vertebral column.  In addition to pain and deformity, vertebral involvement can lead to spinal stenosis, nerve compression, and compression fracture. $The increased formation of new bone in PD is associated with an #elevated serum alkaline phosphatase# level, but because the changes occur slowly, serum calcium and phosphorus levels are often normal.  Radiographs typically reveal lytic or mixed lytic-sclerotic lesions, #thickening of cortical and trabecular bone#, and bony deformities.  In the vertebrae, bony enlargement and cortical thickening may create an appearance resembling a #picture frame#. $#(Choice A)#  The level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D reflects total body vitamin D stores and is useful in the diagnosis of osteomalacia.  In addition to bone pain, osteomalacia causes muscle weakness and difficulty walking.  X-ray reveals diffuse demineralization, often with insufficiency fractures, rather than cortical thickening. $#(Choice C)#  The erythrocyte sedimentation rate reflects circulating levels of inflammatory proteins and is elevated in many inflammatory and malignant conditions.  It is classically elevated in polymyalgia rheumatica; this condition causes pain in the shoulders, hips, and proximal extremities, but x-rays are normal.  It can also be strikingly elevated in multiple myeloma, which can cause osteolytic lesions resembling early pagetic lesions but does not cause cortical thickening. $#(Choice D)#  Hyperparathyroidism can present with bone pain, typically in association with hypercalcemic manifestations (eg, constipation, renal stones).  X-ray of the vertebral column reveals cortical thinning, not thickening. $#(Choice E)#  Prostate-specific antigen is used in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.  Bone metastasis in prostate cancer appears on x-ray as focal sclerotic lesions, and most patients have palpable nodules on prostate examination. $#Educational objective# Paget disease of bone is characterized by excessive and disordered bone formation.  It commonly affects the skull, long bones, and vertebral column.  The increased formation of new bone is associated with an elevated serum alkaline phosphatase level.

GCA a common form of vasculitis and occurs almost exclusively in patients #age >50#.  About half of patients with GCA will also have #polymyalgia rheumatica#, which causes achy pain in the shoulder and hip girdles.  Headache is the most common presentation of GCA, but jaw or tongue claudication is also common.  Ocular manifestations may include amaurosis, diplopia, blurred vision, and ischemic optic neuropathy; untreated GCA may lead to permanent blindness. $Physical findings in GCA may be normal, but patients often have tenderness over the course of the temporal artery.  If GCA is suspected, a #C-reactive protein# (CRP) level or #erythrocyte sedimentation rate# (ESR) should be determined promptly.  Although CRP and ESR are nonspecific, they are highly sensitive and almost always significantly elevated in GCA.

Appropriate management of other cardiovascular risk factors (eg, hyperlipidemia) is recommended but should not delay initial evaluation. $#(Choice D)#  Noncontrast head CT is recommended for initial evaluation of patients with TIA and stroke.  However, this patient has no focal neurologic deficits, and her amaurosis and jaw claudication are more consistent with GCA. $#(Choice E)#  In addition to elevated ESR and CRP levels, other nonspecific signs of inflammation, such as thrombocytosis, may be present in patients with GCA.

  "explanation_2": "This patient has a chronic, symmetric, polyarticular arthritis with joint swelling and stiffness consistent with early #rheumatoid arthritis# (RA).  RA is a progressive autoimmune disorder that is often associated with signs of systemic inflammation (eg, fatigue, fever, anemia).  It has a peak incidence at age 50-75 but can occur at any age; women are affected more commonly than men. $The pathogenesis of RA begins with activation of T lymphocytes in response to rheumatoid antigens (eg, citrullinated peptides, type II collagen).  Activated T cells release cytokines that cause #synovial hyperplasia# with recruitment of additional mononuclear cells.  The accelerated metabolic rate of the inflamed synovial tissue leads to #local hypoxia# and increased production of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 and vascular endothelial growth factor by local macrophages and fibroblasts, resulting in #synovial angiogenesis# (neovascularization). $As the disease progresses, new blood vessels provide nutrients that facilitate expansion of inflamed synovium into a #rheumatoid pannus#, an invasive mass composed of fibroblast-like synovial cells, granulation tissue, and inflammatory cells.  Over time, the pannus encroaches into the joint space and can destroy the articular cartilage and erode the underlying subchondral bone #(choice C)#.  Ossification of the pannus can lead to fusion of the bones across the affected joint (bony ankylosis). $#(Choices A and D)#  Osteoarthritis is characterized by progressive fibrillation (ie, fissuring, fracturing) and erosion of articular cartilage due to increased biomechanical stress.  Periarticular findings include osteophyte formation and subchondral sclerosis due to extensive bone remodeling.  In contrast, RA is more frequently associated with periarticular bone erosions. $#(Choice B)#  Late-stage RA is characterized by widespread joint deformities.  Characteristic findings include ulnar deviation at the metacarpophalangeal joints, swan-neck deformities (hyperextension at the proximal interphalangeal joints with flexion at the distal interphalangeal joints) in the digits, and additional deformities (eg, volar subluxation of the carpus, radial drift) at the wrists. $#Educational objective# Rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by synovial hyperplasia with inflammatory infiltrates.  The accelerated metabolic rate of the inflamed synovium causes local hypoxia, which leads to synovial angiogenesis.  As the disease progresses, the joint space is replaced by a rheumatoid pannus (an invasive mass of fibroblast-like synovial cells, granulation tissue, and inflammatory cells) which can destroy the articular cartilage and underlying subchondral bone.

However, it is associated with prolonged morning stiffness (eg, hours) and improves with exercise.  In addition, onset almost always occurs at age <45. $#(Choice E)#  Back pain may be psychogenic (eg, factitious, malingering).

  "explanation_2": "This patient who recently emigrated from a tuberculosis-endemic region (Nepal) now has progressive back pain, intermittent fever, and vertebral bone destruction with an adjacent fluid collection (abscess), raising strong suspicion for #Mycobacterium tuberculosis spondylitis# (Pott disease). $Primary tuberculosis infections are acquired via inhalation and cause localized pulmonary infection that is typically contained over weeks by the @cell-mediated immune response@.  However, transient bacteremia can occur prior to containment and result in the #hematogenous seeding# of highly vascular organs (eg, spleen, liver, bones); the vertebrae are particularly likely to be affected due to their extensive venous plexuses. $Pott disease typically occurs months to years following primary pulmonary infection.  It is characterized by intermittent fever and slowly worsening pain in the lumbar or lower thoracic spine.  The infection frequently spreads behind the anterior ligament to the adjacent vertebrae and intervertebral disc space, leading to #contiguous bone destruction# and #abscess# formation. $#(Choice A)#  Hodgkin lymphoma is often associated with intermittent fever but typically presents with regional adenopathy and/or a mediastinal mass.  Vertebrae destruction and a fluid collection are not common features. $#(Choices B and C)#  Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone tumor in young adults; however, the long bones are primarily affected, and imaging typically shows a lytic bone lesion.  Rhabdomyosarcoma is a soft-tissue sarcoma that usually arises in the head/neck, genitourinary tract, or extremities; imaging usually reveals a soft-tissue mass.  Neither is typically associated with fever and a fluid collection; these features make an infectious process far more likely. $#(Choice D)#  Staphylococcus aureus is the most common cause of spinal epidural abscess.  Although the radiographic appearance can be similar to Pott disease, most cases arise in the setting of intravenous drug use, hematogenous spread of a distant infection (eg, endocarditis), or direct inoculation during a spinal procedure.  This patient's recent emigration from a tuberculosis-endemic area makes Pott disease more likely. $#Educational objective# Mycobacterium tuberculosis spondylitis (Pott disease) is usually the result of hematogenous seeding of vertebrae from primary pulmonary infection.  Manifestations typically arise months or years later (due to reactivation) and include chronic, progressive back pain, fever, and radiographic evidence of vertebral bone destruction and fluid collection.

  "explanation_2": "This patient and her child have typical features of #parvovirus B19# infection.  Parvovirus is a small, single-stranded DNA virus with respiratory, congenital, or hematogenous transmission.  Initial infection may cause a nonspecific viral syndrome with headache, coryza, and gastrointestinal symptoms.  Parvovirus may subsequently cause 2 primary syndromes in immunocompetent patients: $• #Erythema infectiosum# (fifth disease), found primarily in children:  This disease manifests as a bright red rash on the cheeks with circumoral pallor and fever.  Patients may also have a generalized reticular rash on the arms, legs, and trunk. $• #Acute arthropathy#, found primarily in adults:  This symmetric polyarthritis involves the proximal interphalangeal, metacarpal, knee, and ankle joints.  The arthritis is self-limited and nondestructive. $The initial nonspecific period of infection is associated with heavy viremia and viral shedding.  By contrast, erythema infectiosum and acute arthropathy signify an active immune response with formation of #immune complexes# and minimal or undetectable viremia.  These patients have much reduced infectivity. $#(Choice A)#  Gout causes acute monoarthritis, usually affecting the lower extremity (great toe, ankle, knee). $#(Choice B)#  Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection causes oral or genital lesions characterized by grouped vesicles on an erythematous base.  HSV does not usually cause arthritis. $#(Choice C)#  Lyme disease causes a characteristic annular erythematous rash (erythema chronicum migrans).  Asymmetric arthritis may develop in late or chronic Lyme disease. $#(Choice E)#  In rheumatic fever, there may be migratory pain and swelling of the large joints in addition to fever, carditis, choreiform movements, and @erythema marginatum@.  Rheumatic fever develops following streptococcal pharyngitis. $#(Choice F)#  Rheumatoid arthritis may cause an acute polyarthropathy that is initially similar to parvovirus arthritis.  The symptoms may be temporarily relieved with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs but would not resolve as promptly as they did in this patient.  In addition, serum rheumatoid factor is usually, although not always, positive. $#(Choice G)#  The typical initial onset of systemic lupus erythematosus is characterized by malaise, weight loss, malar facial rash, and arthralgias. $#Educational objective# Parvovirus B19 causes erythema infectiosum (fifth disease) in children and arthritis in adults.  Parvovirus arthritis can mimic rheumatoid arthritis but is usually self-resolving.  ",

  "explanation_2": "There are two main subtypes of systemic sclerosis: diffuse scleroderma, which is characterized by diffuse skin and visceral involvement, and CREST syndrome, which is associated with localized skin involvement and a more benign course.  'CREST' is an acronym for the signs and symptoms: #C#alcinosis, #R#aynaud's phenomenon, #E#sophageal dysmotility, #S#clerodactyly and #T#elangiectasias.  Anti-centromere antibodies are specific for CREST syndrome and found in 40% of cases.  Anti-DNA topoisomerase I (Scl-70) antibodies are highly specific for systemic sclerosis (diffuse scleroderma). $The patient in the vignette has CREST syndrome.  #Raynaud's phenomenon #causes painful episodes of pallor, cyanosis, and erythema of the hands in response to cold or emotional stress.  These episodes of vasospasm can last minutes to hours.  #Esophageal dysmotility# is the result of fibrosis of the distal esophagus with associated esophageal hypomotility.  It manifests with symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux (heartburn and regurgitation).  #Sclerodactyly# is thickening of the skin of the hands and feet.  It begins as non-pitting edema of the hands and fingers.  Later in the course of the disease, the skin becomes thickened, tight and shiny.  Thinning of the skin (atrophy) follows.  #Telangiectasias# (dilated blood vessels) occur on the skin of the face, hands and upper trunk, and on mucosal surfaces.  #Calcinosis #refers to subcutaneous calcium deposits which may be asymptomatic or painful. $#(Choice A)#  Anti-dsDNA antibodies are specific for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Patients with SLE commonly have a malar ('butterfly') facial rash that worsens with sun exposure.  Patients also complain of low-grade fever, joint swelling and/or tenderness, and oral ulcers. $#(Choice C )#  Anti-histone antibodies are found in drug-induced lupus.  Procainamide, hydralazine, isoniazid, and D-penicillamine are common causes of drug-induced lupus.  Symptoms resemble those of SLE, but without renal or CNS involvement. $#(Choice D)#  Anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibodies are found in patients with Sjogren syndrome.  This condition is characterized by keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eyes) and xerostomia (dry mouth).  There may also be parotid gland enlargement, increased risk of other autoimmune diseases, and increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphomas. $#(Choice E)#  Anti-phospholipid antibodies are found in patients with SLE and in antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.  Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome causes a hypercoagulable state and patients may suffer recurrent miscarriages.  Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is paradoxically increased in these patients despite the propensity toward thrombosis. $#Educational objective# CREST syndrome (limited scleroderma) manifests with calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly and telangiectasias.  Anti-centromere antibodies are found in about 40% of patients with CREST syndrome.  Anti-DNA topoisomerase I (Scl-70) antibodies are highly specific for systemic sclerosis.  "

Potential causes include #septic arthritis# (gonococcal, nongonococcal), crystal arthropathy (eg, gout), hemarthrosis, and rheumatic disease.  Acute monoarthritis, particularly when accompanied by #fever# and #loss of joint mobility#, warrants an #expedited evaluation# because of the concern for septic arthritis, which can lead to both short- and long-term complications (eg, sepsis, joint destruction) if not diagnosed rapidly. $Acute monoarthritis is best evaluated with diagnostic arthrocentesis and #synovial fluid analysis#.  Arthrocentesis is performed by inserting a needle into the affected joint after properly cleansing the overlying skin and then withdrawing synovial fluid.  Gross inspection may assist in the diagnosis, with purulent or cloudy fluid suggesting an infectious or inflammatory process.  Fluid should be sent for cell count, Gram stain, culture, and crystal analysis. $#(Choice A)#  A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (eg, ibuprofen) and close follow-up may be appropriate for monoarthritis due to trauma or osteoarthritis.  However, this patient has had no recent injuries, and osteoarthritis is unlikely to cause fever and such acute and severe knee pain, swelling, and restricted range of motion. $#(Choice B)#  Rheumatoid factor assay can aid in the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).  Although RA can cause joint pain, erythema, and restricted range of motion, joint involvement is more commonly symmetric and polyarticular (eg, ≥3 joints), with an insidious (vs acute) onset of symptoms. $#(Choice C)#  Serum ferritin levels are used in the diagnosis of hemochromatosis, which can cause arthritis due to iron deposition in the articular cartilage and synovium; however, the onset of joint pain is typically gradual (vs acute), and the hand metacarpophalangeal joints (particularly the second and third joints) are usually affected first. $#(Choice D)#  Synovial fluid crystal analysis, not a serum uric acid level, is the definitive test for gout because serum uric acid levels may be normal during an acute gout attack.  In addition, serum uric acid levels do not rule out other important causes of monoarthritis such as septic arthritis. $#Educational objective# Acute monoarthritis is characterized by pain, erythema, swelling, and reduced range of motion in a joint.

Deletions that are not a multiple of 3 change the reading frame, causing a #frameshift mutation#, which results in a nonfunctional protein and severe clinical manifestations (DMD).  In contrast, deletions that are a multiple of 3 base pairs preserve the reading frame, resulting in a truncated but functional protein and a milder clinical phenotype (BMD). $Dystrophin is a structural component of skeletal muscle fibers that provides mechanical stability to the sarcolemma.  It #links# a component of the #cytoskeleton# (actin) to #transmembrane proteins# (α- and β-dystrophiglycans) that are connected to the extracellular matrix.  Loss of dystrophin results in cellular injury (myonecrosis).  On light microscopy, there is segmental degeneration and regeneration of the myofibers with marked variation in size (both atrophic and hypertrophic fibers).  Over time, the muscle tissue undergoes progressive fatty replacement. $On clinical examination, the presence of #Gowers sign# and calf enlargement in a boy age 2-5 is classic for DMD.  Calf hypertrophy allows affected children to overcome proximal muscle weakness, but it is later replaced by fat and connective tissue (#pseudohypertrophy#).  The Gowers sign involves the use of one's hands to rise from a squat or from a chair to compensate for proximal muscle weakness. $#(Choice A)#  Endomysial inflammatory infiltration is found on muscle biopsy in polymyositis.  Dermatomyositis is associated with perifascicular inflammation.  Both diseases cause proximal muscle weakness but not distal muscle hypertrophy. $#(Choice B)#  Endoneural inflammatory infiltration is characteristic of Guillain-Barré syndrome, which classically manifests as ascending flaccid paralysis and hyporeflexia. $#(Choice C)#  Examples of ion channel myopathies include hyper- and hypokalemic periodic paralysis, which present with episodic, painless muscle weakness. $#(Choice D)#  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is due to mutation of the genes responsible for myelin synthesis.  Affected patients frequently present with distal muscle weakness, sensory loss, and atrophy of the calf muscles (producing the characteristic stork leg deformity). $#(Choice F)#  Mutations involving sarcomere proteins are responsible for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and certain forms of familial dilated cardiomyopathy. $#Educational objective# Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an X-linked recessive myopathy that manifests with proximal muscle weakness and enlargement of the calf muscles in boys age 2-5.  It most often results from frameshift deletions affecting the dystrophin gene.  Dystrophin provides a stabilizing interaction between the sarcolemma and the intracellular contraction apparatus, and disruption of the protein results in membrane damage and myonecrosis.  "

  "explanation_2": "$This patient has a chronic, symmetric, deforming arthritis consistent with #advanced rheumatoid arthritis# (RA).  His examination shows classic features including joint enlargement, #ulnar deviation# at the metacarpophalangeal joints, and #swan neck deformities# (hyperextension at the proximal interphalangeal joints with flexion at the distal interphalangeal joints). $The joint destruction in RA is thought to be initiated by CD4+ T helper cells and is characterized by #synovial hyperplasia# and an #inflammatory infiltrates# (often containing lymphoid follicles).  The joint space often becomes replaced by a #synovial pannus#, an invasive mass composed of fibroblast-like synovial cells, granulation tissue, and inflammatory cells.  Release of proteinases (eg, matrix metallopeptidase 13) causes #destruction #of the articular cartilaginous matrix, facilitating erosion of the surrounding #articular cartilage# and underlying bone.  Ossification of the pannus can lead to fusion of the bones across the affected joint (bony ankylosis). $#(Choices A and E)#  Calcific degeneration of the articular cartilage (chondrocalcinosis) is a characteristic feature of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease (pseudogout).  Deposition of uric acid crystals results in gout.  Both gout and pseudogout are inflammatory arthritides that can cause pain and joint deformation but present with acute, episodic arthritis and are more common in the lower extremities. $#(Choice B)#  Osteoarthritis is characterized by progressive fracturing and erosion of the articular cartilage.  Periarticular findings include osteophyte formation and subchondral sclerosis.  When osteoarthritis affects the hands, it typically presents with bony enlargement at the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints (Bouchard and Heberden nodes, respectively) rather than ulnar deviation at the metacarpophalangeal joints. $#(Choice C)#  Autoimmune complex deposition (type III hypersensitivity) plays a significant role in the arthritis associated with systemic lupus erythematosus.  Although lupus may cause a chronic destructive arthritis resembling RA in a minority of cases, lupus arthritis is typically migratory, nondeforming, and much more common in younger women than in older men. $#Educational objective# Joint destruction in rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by synovial hyperplasia, an inflammatory infiltrate, and synovial angiogenesis.  The joint space often becomes replaced by pannus, an invasive mass composed of fibroblast-like synovial cells, granulation tissue, and inflammatory cells that can erode into the articular cartilage and underlying bone.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient's biopsy demonstrates #muscle fiber-type grouping#, in which the normal checkerboard pattern of type I and type II muscle fibers is lost, and fibers of the same type are grouped together.  This is characteristic of #muscle reinnervation after denervation#.  Skeletal muscle fibers are categorized into @2 major types@: $• #Type I fibers# (slow-twitch) specialize in stamina by using oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria for steady and sustained ATP production.  The high content of myoglobin gives these fibers a red color. $• #Type II fibers# (fast-twitch) specialize in rapid bursts of strength by using anaerobic glycolysis.  The lower quantities of mitochondria and myoglobin lead to a pale color. $Muscle fibers are arranged into a #motor unit# composed of the #same fiber type#, with each unit innervated by a single motor neuron.  On histologic section, these motor units form a characteristic mixed #checkerboard pattern# of type I and type II fibers. $When muscle denervation first takes place, there is atrophy of both types of muscle fibers.  The affected myocytes then stimulate nearby nerves to undergo #collateral sprouting# to reinnervate the muscle fibers, which usually results in #adjacent muscle fibers# being innervated by the #same neuron#.  Because the muscle fiber type is dependent on the characteristics of the innervating neuron, reinnervation typically leads to #clustering# of muscle fiber types. $#(Choice A)#  Autoimmune muscle injury (eg, dermatomyositis, @polymyositis@) often shows an inflammatory cellular infiltrate with myofiber necrosis, fragmentation, and phagocytosis.  Over time, the active inflammation and necrosis are replaced by fibrosis. $#(Choice B)#  Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies are caused by mutations affecting dystrophin, a cytoplasmic protein vital for stabilization of the muscle cell membrane.  Loss of cell membrane integrity leads to muscle fiber degeneration and fibrofatty replacement. $#(Choice C)#  Certain types of glycogen storage diseases can lead to weakness and fatigue due to abnormal glycogenolysis in skeletal muscle.  Muscle biopsy would show enlarged lysosomes containing periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive material, but no change in the arrangement of muscle fiber types. $#(Choice E)#  Statin-induced muscle damage is often characterized by myofiber necrosis without an associated inflammatory infiltrate.  Muscle aches and weakness are the most common complications of statin therapy and are likely due, at least in part, to decreased production of coenzyme Q10. $#Educational objective# With muscle denervation and reinnervation, nerve fiber collateral sprouting results in adjacent muscle fibers being innervated by the same neuron.  This leads to loss of the normal histologic checkerboard pattern of type I and type II muscle fibers and results in muscle fiber-type grouping.  ",

Gout develops in patients with #hyperuricemia# and is associated with several risk factors including excessive alcohol intake, meat/seafood consumption, chronic kidney disease, and certain medications. $#Cyclosporine# is a common cause of gout exacerbations in patients who have undergone solid organ transplantation, particularly renal transplantation.  This medication #impairs renal excretion of uric acid#, resulting in hyperuricemia.  Although high doses of systemic glucocorticoids (eg, prednisone) can be used to treat acute gout, the low doses used for immunosuppression in patients who have undergone transplantation are usually not sufficient to prevent gout flares. $#(Choice B)#  Increased production of uric acid is commonly due to a purine-rich diet (eg, red meat, seafood), excessive alcohol intake, fructose-sweetened beverage intake, or disorders associated with increased cell turnover (eg, myeloproliferative disorders, cancers). $#(Choice C)#  Urate-lowering agents (eg, allopurinol) are used to prevent recurrent gout but can occasionally precipitate a gout flare due to rapid declines in blood uric acid levels, which can disrupt preexisting crystal deposits and increase their immunogenicity.  This patient is not taking a medication that lowers uric acid levels. $#(Choice D)#  Patients who have malignancy associated with high tumor burdens (eg, acute lymphoblastic leukemia) can develop tumor lysis syndrome when cytotoxic chemotherapy is initiated.  The massive release of nucleic acids into the circulation (from lysed cells) increases serum uric acid levels (due to catabolism of purine nucleic acids) and can precipitate gout. $#(Choice E)#  Diuretics (eg, furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide) can be associated with gout as these medications reduce urate excretion in the proximal tubule and also cause volume depletion leading to decreased renal perfusion and filtration of uric acid.  This patient has a normal serum creatinine level, indicating adequate renal function. $#Educational objective# Patients undergoing solid organ transplantation are at increased risk of gout due to medications that impair renal clearance of uric acid.

The decision now needs to be made whether to initiate long term preventive therapy.  Patients who have only occasional episodes of gout may not need prophylactic treatment.  However, uric acid-lowering medications can be helpful in patients with frequent episodes of gouty arthritis, chronic joint destruction, uric acid renal stones, or @tophi@. $In addition to acute gout, this patient has had recurring episodes of likely uric acid stones and should be considered for #prophylactic therapy#.  The preferred treatment to prevent recurrent attacks is #xanthine oxidase inhibitors# (eg, allopurinol, febuxostat), which decrease @uric acid@ production.  Prophylactic therapy is usually initiated during intercritical periods (#between attacks#), as changes in serum uric acid levels can worsen an acute attack. $#(Choice A)#  Antibiotic therapy is used in the management of septic arthritis.  Although septic arthritis can cause an acute monoarthritis, it would be unlikely to respond to analgesics. $#(Choice B)#  Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) act by inhibiting cyclooxygenase.  NSAIDs are the first-line therapy for acute gouty arthritis and can prevent an acute flare while urate-lowering therapy is started.  However, they are not normally used for long-term therapy due to risk of peptic ulcer. $#(Choice C)#  Oral or intraarticular glucocorticoids can be used for acute gout in patients who cannot tolerate NSAIDs or colchicine.  However, they have significant long-term side effects. $#(Choice D)#  Lipoxygenase inhibitors (eg, zileuton) are oral anti-inflammatory medications used in the long-term management of asthma.  They are not useful for treatment of gout. $#(Choice E)#  Uricosuric agents (eg, probenecid) are second-line drugs for chronic management of gout.  These drugs increase renal excretion of uric acid and are therefore contraindicated in patients with a history of renal stones. $#Educational objective# Chronic uric acid-lowering therapy is recommended for patients with gout who have frequent gouty attacks, uric acid kidney stones, tophi, or chronic joint destruction from gout.  Xanthine oxidase inhibitors are the preferred treatment.  ",

Following ingestion, @azathioprine@ is converted to 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), which is a false purine base that, like hypoxanthine and guanine, can follow 1 of 2 routes.  Some 6-MP is converted by xanthine oxidase (or thiopurine methyltransferase) into inactive metabolites that are excreted in the urine.  The remainder is converted by HGPRT into active metabolites (6-thioguanines), which act as false nucleotides that incorporate into DNA and RNA and inhibit hematopoietic cell proliferation.  Therefore, when a #xanthine oxidase inhibitor is combined with azathioprine#, 6-MP is shunted toward #conversion into active metabolites#, leading to increased immunosuppression and risk of #cellular toxicity#. $#(Choice B)#  Ganciclovir is similar in structure to guanosine and forms false purine nucleotides that disrupt DNA synthesis.  It is relatively specific for viral DNA replication enzymes; it does not interact with allopurinol because it is not catabolized by xanthine oxidase. $#(Choices C and D)#  Prednisone exerts a nonspecific immunosuppressive effect by inhibiting NF-kB to regulate the transcription of leukoproliferative cytokines.  Tacrolimus is a calcineurin inhibitor that suppresses T cells by preventing IL-2 transcription.  Neither drug targets the purine degradation pathway and therefore is not significantly influenced by xanthine oxidase inhibition. $#(Choice E)#  Trimethoprim inhibits dihydrofolate reductase to disrupt folate metabolism and inhibit the production of pyrimidine nucleotides.  It is not affected by the inhibition of xanthine oxidase in the purine degradation pathway. $#Educational objective# Azathioprine is an immunosuppression drug that is metabolized into active metabolites by HGPRT and, conversely, inactivated by xanthine oxidase.  Coadministration with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor (eg, allopurinol, febuxostat) shunts azathioprine metabolism toward the production of active metabolites, resulting in increased immunosuppression and risk of cellular toxicity.

  "explanation_2": "$#Thiazide diuretics# (eg, hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone) are indicated for treatment of patients with hypertension, including those who also have diabetes mellitus.  Although thiazides can cause a small increase in blood glucose, this effect is often not clinically significant and substantially outweighed by their blood pressure-lowering benefits. $Thiazides inhibit the #Na-Cl cotransporter# in the distal convoluted tubule, leading to decreased sodium reabsorption.  Thiazides also cause peripheral vasodilation, resulting in reduced peripheral vascular resistance.  In addition, thiazide diuretics increase #calcium reabsorption# in the distal tubule.  Studies have shown that use of thiazides is associated with higher bone mineral density and reduced fracture risk, and many experts recommend them for treatment of hypertension in patients who are at risk for osteoporosis.  Increased calcium reabsorption also causes hypocalciuria, which may prevent recurrent renal stones in some patients. $#(Choice A)#  Several antiepileptic drugs (eg, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital) are associated with decreased bone mineral density and increased risk of osteoporosis. $#(Choice B)#  Diltiazem is a calcium channel blocker that is indicated for treatment of hypertension.  It is also used for rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation.  It has no significant effect on serum calcium levels, bone density, or fracture risk. $#(Choice C)#  Escitalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) indicated for treatment of depression and generalized anxiety disorder.  SSRIs are associated with a small decrease in bone density; their effect on fracture risk has not been well studied. $#(Choice D)#  Furosemide is a loop diuretic used to treat congestive heart failure (CHF).  It causes an increase in urinary calcium loss that may worsen osteoporosis. $#(Choice F)#  Lansoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) used to treat gastroesophageal reflux and peptic ulcer.  PPIs inhibit the enzyme H-K-ATPase on gastric parietal cells and reduce gastric acid secretion.  PPIs also decrease calcium and magnesium absorption, and long-term use is associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis. $#(Choice G)#  Metformin suppresses hepatic gluconeogenesis and increases insulin sensitivity and peripheral glucose uptake.  It has no significant effect on osteoporosis risk. $#(Choice H)#  Spironolactone is an aldosterone inhibitor used to treat CHF.  Spironolactone can cause hyperkalemia, but it does not have a significant effect on calcium homeostasis. $#Educational objective# Thiazide diuretics increase calcium absorption in the distal convoluted tubules within the nephron.  Thiazides are associated with increased bone mineral density and are recommended for treatment of hypertension in patients at risk for osteoporosis.  Loop diuretics increase urinary calcium loss.

Most cases of DILE improve rapidly when the inciting agent is discontinued. $The drug that triggered DILE in this patient was likely #isoniazid# (a common component of multidrug therapy for TB), which is metabolized via phase II acetylation in the liver.  Hepatic expression of N-acetyltransferase is genetically determined, and patients with a #slow acetylator# phenotype are at #greatest risk for DILE#.  These patients are also predisposed to isoniazid-induced peripheral neuropathy due to retention of the drug over time, leading to elevated drug levels.

  "explanation_2": "Acute onset of pain and swelling of the first metatarsophalangeal joint and joint aspiration showing needle-shaped, negatively birefringent crystals are diagnostic for acute gouty arthritis.  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the mainstay of treatment for most patients.  However, colchicine is often used in patients with mild-to-moderate renal failure, peptic ulcer disease, or other contraindications to NSAIDs.  Colchicine is an effective anti-inflammatory agent in acute gouty arthritis and acts by binding to the intracellular protein tubulin, preventing tubulin polymerization into microtubules.  This leads to impaired leukocyte migration and phagocytosis, reducing the inflammation seen in gouty arthritis.  Because colchicine also disrupts microtubule formation in gastrointestinal mucosal cells, many patients develop diarrhea and, less commonly, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. $#(Choices A and E)#  Probenecid decreases proximal tubular uric acid reabsorption, and allopurinol inhibits xanthine oxidase (converts xanthine to uric acid).  These medications are prescribed to lower serum uric acid levels in chronic gout.  These agents are contraindicated in acute gouty arthritis as they can mobilize tissue stores of uric acid and precipitate or worsen acute attacks. $#(Choice B)#  NSAIDs induce their anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 isoenzymes, thus blocking prostaglandin synthesis.  Because they can cause significant gastrointestinal irritation (eg, nausea, dyspepsia, bleeding), their use is contraindicated in patients with peptic ulcer disease. $#(Choice D)#  Glucocorticosteroids exert their anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting phospholipase A2 activity.  These medications can be used in acute gout and are not associated with significant diarrhea. $#Educational objective# Colchicine is a second-line agent for treating acute gouty arthritis.  It inhibits tubulin polymerization and microtubule formation in leukocytes, reducing neutrophil chemotaxis and emigration to sites inflamed by tissue deposition of monosodium urate crystals.  Gastrointestinal mucosal function is also impaired by microtubule disruption, leading to diarrhea and, less commonly, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.  "

  "explanation_2": "$This patient's limb shortening with normal torso length, specific craniofacial features (frontal bossing, midface hypoplasia), and risk of passing the condition to her offspring (50%) are characteristic of #achondroplasia#.  The condition is caused by an autosomal dominant point mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene; 90% are de novo (unaffected parents) and 10% are inherited.  Because the mutation is #autosomal dominant#, the fetus of an affected and an unaffected parent has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation. $Achondroplasia affects #endochondral ossification#, the process that makes #long bones# (eg, humerus, femur, phalanges) and portions of the skull and face.  In endochondral bone formation, mesenchymal cells differentiate into chondrocytes that secrete cartilage matrix.  These chondrocytes continue to proliferate through childhood, forming an elongating cartilage template that progressively becomes calcified and later invaded by osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and blood vessels originating from the periosteum.  Deposition of osteoid matrix over the septa of calcified cartilage matrix forms woven bone, which then undergoes remodeling into compact bone. $#FGFR3# is normally responsible for limiting chondrocyte proliferation during endochondral ossification.  In achondroplasia, FGFR3 becomes constitutively activated, causing exaggerated #inhibition of chondrocyte proliferation# that results in the characteristic bone shortening and craniofacial abnormalities. $#(Choices B and E)#  Hypothalamic neurosecretory cells produce growth hormone-releasing hormone and anterior pituitary somatotrophs produce growth hormone (GH).  Hypothalamic or pituitary insults (eg, tumor, ischemia) can result in defective release of either hormone.  GH deficiency can lead to proportional short stature (both long and flat bones affected) as opposed to the disproportionate short stature seen in achondroplasia (only long bones affected). $#(Choice C)#  The flat bones (eg, most of the skull, pelvis) grow primarily via intramembranous (not endochondral) ossification.  In intramembranous ossification, mesenchymal cells differentiate directly into osteoblasts and begin osteoid matrix secretion without the formation of cartilaginous bones.  As a result, most flat bones remain unaffected in achondroplasia. $#(Choice D)#  Osteoclasts are specialized macrophages that function to resorb bone.  @Paget disease@, characterized by disordered bone mass, initially begins with excessive activity of abnormally large osteoclasts followed by osteoblastic activity and eventual sclerosis.  Patients are usually elderly and can present with focal bone pain and pathologic fractures. $#Educational objective# Unlike the process of intramembranous ossification that forms flat bones, endochondral ossification proceeds along a cartilage template and is responsible for the formation of long bones.  Achondroplasia is characterized by an exaggerated inhibition of chondrocyte proliferation in the growth plates of long bones and manifests with proximal limb shortening, midface hypoplasia, and macrocephaly.

The weakness may be painless or associated with diffuse myalgias.  Muscle enzyme levels (eg, creatine kinase) are invariably elevated, and autoantibodies (eg, antinuclear antibodies, anti-Jo-1 antibodies) are present in most cases.  Polymyositis is similar to dermatomyositis, although it lacks the typical @skin findings@; both may occur independently or as a paraneoplastic manifestation of an underlying malignancy. $Polymyositis is an inflammatory myopathy triggered by unknown, possibly viral, antigens.  It likely represents a cell-mediated immune response against myocytes.  Increased expression of #major histocompatibility complex class I# antigens on the sarcolemma has been demonstrated and likely leads to presentation of autoantigens to #CD8+ cytotoxic cells# that subsequently initiate myocyte destruction.  Muscle biopsy in polymyositis reveals inflammation, patchy necrosis, and regeneration and fibrosis of muscle fibers.  Infiltration of the endomysium by macrophages and CD8+ lymphocytes is typically seen. $#(Choice A)#  Joint involvement in systemic sclerosis may cause arthralgias and contractures, but muscle weakness is not seen. $#(Choices B and C)#  Myasthenia gravis is caused by anti-acetylcholine receptor autoantibodies and is characterized by episodic weakness that initially affects the ocular/bulbar musculature.  The Eaton-Lambert myasthenic syndrome is a paraneoplastic condition causing fatigable weakness in the extremities; it is caused by autoantibodies to presynaptic calcium channels.  Light microscopy of muscle biopsy specimens is normal in these conditions. $#(Choice D)#  Polyarteritis nodosa is an uncommon systemic vasculitis that presents with intermittent episodes of abdominal pain, peripheral neuropathy, renal insufficiency, and severe hypertension.  Biopsy is characterized by transmural inflammation of the arterial wall with fibrinoid necrosis. $#(Choice E)#  Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) causes myalgias of the shoulder and pelvic girdle muscles, often with systemic symptoms (eg, fever, weight loss).  Weakness is not typical, and PMR occurs almost exclusively in patients age >50. $#Educational objective# Polymyositis causes symmetric proximal muscle weakness.  Muscle biopsy reveals inflammation, necrosis, and regeneration of muscle fibers.  Over-expression of major histocompatibility complex class I proteins on the sarcolemma leads to infiltration with CD8+ T lymphocytes and myocyte damage.  ",

Osteocyte survival is regulated by a variety of factors including mechanical stress, local growth factors, and steroid hormone levels.  Although osteocytes produce RANK-L, which acts on osteoclasts, osteocyte survival is not dependent on the RANK signaling pathway. $#Educational objective# The nuclear factor kappa B (RANK)/RANK-ligand (RANK-L) interaction is essential for the formation and differentiation of osteoclasts.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient has skin thickening in the digits consistent with #systemic sclerosis# (SS) (also called scleroderma), an autoimmune disease characterized by widespread #fibrosis# in multiple organ systems.  The pathogenesis of SS primarily involves an interplay between immunologic and vascular processes that ultimately results in excess fibrosis and vasculopathy.  The main cells involved are endothelial cells, T lymphocytes, and fibroblasts: $• #Vascular endothelial cells# produce excessive #endothelin 1#, which causes vasoconstriction and activation of underlying fibroblasts.  They also increase expression of #adhesion molecules#, which facilitates binding and extravasation of circulating lymphocytes. $• #T lymphocytes# migrate into the tissues and increase expression of numerous cytokines that further activate tissue fibroblasts. $• #Dermal fibroblasts# produce increasing quantities of #collagen# and ground substance, leading to thickening and stiffening of the tissue. $The skin in SS undergoes dermal expansion due to diffuse deposition of collagen (eosinophilic connective tissue), resulting in atrophy of the intradermal adipose tissue and obliteration of dermal appendages (eg, hair follicles, glands).  Early symptoms often include finger swelling and mild pruritus.  With progression of the disease, patients may experience dermal sclerosis (@sclerodactyly@), dermal ulcers, nail atrophy, and digital calcinosis. $#(Choice A)#  @Psoriasis@ is characterized by activation of antigen-presenting dendritic cells, leading to recruitment and differentiation of T-helper cells, which in turn produce additional inflammatory cytokines that stimulate keratinocyte proliferation and generate a neutrophilic response (eg, focal microabscesses).  However, psoriasis presents with well-demarcated, scaly, erythematous plaques rather than skin thickening and ulceration. $#(Choice C)#  The immune response in Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection is characterized by stimulation of CD4 T lymphocytes; these cells subsequently activate macrophages, which can differentiate into epithelioid histiocytes and coalesce into multinucleated Langhans @giant cells@.  Cutaneous tuberculosis may present with a variety of skin lesions (eg, papules, plaques, pustules), but thickening and ulceration of digital skin are more consistent with SS. $#(Choice D)#  Migration of T lymphocytes, eosinophils, and basophils is seen in the late acute phase of asthma as well as in allergic and chronic urticaria.  Urticaria manifests as acute erythematous wheals, not chronic sclerodactyly and ulceration. $#Educational objective# The pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) involves vascular endothelial cells (increased expression of endothelin 1 and adhesion molecules), T lymphocytes (production of cytokines that activate fibroblasts), and dermal fibroblasts (increased production of collagen and ground substance).

The diagnosis is made clinically, but the presence of #anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies# is helpful for confirmation. $Tissue inflammation causes #arginine# residues in proteins such as vimentin to be enzymatically converted into #citrulline# through a process called citrullination.  This alters the shape of the proteins, which can then serve as neoantigens that generate an immune response.  In RA, the immune response against citrullinated proteins is exaggerated, resulting in high titers of anti-CCP antibodies that are not usually present in other inflammatory conditions.  Thus, anti-CCP antibodies have a #high specificity# for RA.

MG is caused by impaired functioning of nicotinic cholinergic receptors at the neuromuscular junction due to interference by #IgG autoantibodies#.  First-line treatment is an anticholinesterase agent (eg, pyridostigmine), which increases the amount of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction.  Acetylcholinesterase activity decreases at lower temperatures, so application of an #ice pack# can also improve symptoms caused by weakness of superficial muscles (eg, ptosis). $MG is a form of @type II hypersensitivity@, which is characterized by IgM and/or IgG #autoantibodies# that bind to cell surface antigens and/or extracellular matrix components.  Among the available options, only #Goodpasture syndrome# is due to the production of autoantibodies (directed against type IV collagen in the alveolar/glomerular basement membrane); these antibodies cause inflammatory destruction of the lung alveoli and renal glomeruli. $#(Choice A)#  Atopic dermatitis is a chronic, pruritic, eczematous skin condition that almost always begins in childhood.  The pathogenicity involves several factors, including skin barrier abnormalities, defects in innate immunity, and a TH2-skewed immune response. $#(Choice B)#  The pathogenesis of contact dermatitis (@type IV hypersensitivity reaction@) involves cutaneous exposure to small foreign molecules (haptens) that bind to skin proteins.  These proteins are subsequently processed by antigen-presenting Langerhans cells that promote the development of hapten-specific T cells.  With continued hapten exposure, sensitized T cells produce inflammatory cytokines at the exposure site, causing the characteristic eczematous skin changes. $#(Choice D)#  Most patients with acute hypersensitivity pneumonitis have specific serum IgG antibodies that precipitate bacterial or fungal antigens found in inhaled organic dust particles.  This causes interstitial alveolitis and bronchiolitis via immune-complex and complement deposition in vessel walls (@type III hypersensitivity mechanism@). $#(Choice E)#  The pathogenesis of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis involves granular deposition of immune complexes containing group A Streptococcus antigens, IgG, and C3 in the glomerular basement membrane and mesangium.  It is a type III, immune complex–mediated, hypersensitivity response. $#Educational objective# Myasthenia gravis results from an autoimmune type II (antibody-mediated) hypersensitivity reaction against skeletal myocyte surface acetylcholine receptors.

The disease is thought to be caused by environmental factors and gene mutations (eg, affecting RANK, osteoprotegerin) that result in excessive RANK and NF-κB activation.

  "explanation_2": "This patient has rapidly progressive pain, swelling, and gas/necrosis at the site of a penetrating foot injury, raising strong suspicion for #Clostridium perfringens# infection.  C perfringens is an obligate anaerobic, spore-forming, #gram-positive rod# found in soil.  Most cases develop following the introduction of spores into tissue during #penetrating injury# (eg, knife wound, puncture wound); significant vascular damage is generally required to create the #anaerobic environment# necessary for vegetative bacterial proliferation. $C perfringens classically causes #gas gangrene# (eg, necrosis, gas in tissue) #within hours# of infection.  This is primarily mediated by the generation of #alpha toxin# (lecithinase), a potent phospholipase C mimetic that #splits host phospholipids#.  This compound hydrolyzes lecithin-containing lipoprotein complexes in cell membranes, which causes cell lysis, tissue necrosis, and edema.  It also mediates intravascular aggregations of platelets, neutrophils, and fibrin, which results in vascular occlusion and further promotes the anaerobic environment required for bacterial proliferation.  Although C perfringens produces a vast array of other cytotoxins, alpha toxin is thought to mediate its most devastating effects. $C perfringens uses #carbohydrates# for energy; its rapid metabolism of muscle tissue carbohydrates produces significant amounts of #gas#, which can be seen on plain radiographs or CT scans #(choice B).# $#(Choice A)#  Actin depolymerization is mediated by Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile cytotoxin B, which primarily causes infectious diarrhea. $#(Choice C)#  Inactivation of elongation factor 2 through ribosylation is the mechanism of action for diphtheria toxin.  Cutaneous diphtheria is generally marked by nonhealing ulcers; it does not typically cause rapid-onset necrosis and gas formation. $#(Choice E)#  Plasminogen activators such as streptokinase, urokinase, and tissue plasminogen activator convert plasminogen to plasmin.  Of these 3 enzymes, only streptokinase, an exotoxin released by Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus), is a bacterial product.  Streptococcal skin infection is usually marked by spreading, nonpurulent cellulitis, not gas gangrene. $#(Choice F)#  Inhibition of presynaptic acetylcholine release is the mechanism of action of botulinum toxin, which primarily causes cranial neuropathy and descending paralysis. $#(Choice G)#  Certain Staphylococcus aureus–produced toxins act as superantigens by hyperstimulating T cells and causing massive cytokine production.  Examples include enterotoxin, which causes food poisoning, and toxic shock syndrome toxin.  S aureus can cause purulent cellulitis, but rapid-onset gas gangrene is atypical. $#Educational objective# Lecithinase (alpha toxin) is the main toxin produced by Clostridium perfringens.  It degrades lecithin, a component of cellular phospholipid membranes, which leads to membrane destruction, cell death, and widespread necrosis and hemolysis.  "

Although a handful of fairly uncommon pathogens (eg, Mycobacterium marinum, Nocardia, Leishmania) can cause nodular lymphangitis, the most likely pathogen in this case is #Sporothrix schenckii#. $S schenckii is a dimorphic fungus that exists as #cigar-shaped yeasts# at body temperature and reproduces by #narrow-based budding#.  It exists as a mold in the environment and tends to grow in #decaying plant matter and soil#, particularly on sphagnum moss, hay, and decaying wood.  Transmission typically occurs when the organism is introduced into cutaneous or subcutaneous tissue while a person is farming, landscaping, or gardening. $Manifestations of infection progress slowly over days or weeks and usually begin with a #painless papule# at the site of inoculation that eventually ulcerates; notably, the lesion does #not drain pus# or odorous material.  Similar lesions arise over several days more proximally along the lymphatic channel.  Systemic symptoms (eg, fever) do not generally occur.  Most cases can be diagnosed clinically, but culture of a sample from a lesion can definitively identify the organism. $#(Choice A)#  Bat guano can carry Histoplasma capsulatum, which typically causes a mild, subacute pulmonary infection.  Nodular lesions can develop as part of disseminated infection, but lesions are usually bilateral and do not exhibit proximal spread.  In addition, disseminated infections are almost always seen in severely immunocompromised patients (eg, AIDS). $#(Choice C)#  Mycobacterium marinum is an uncommon pathogen that causes infection following inoculation of a wound with contaminated freshwater or seawater.  Most cases are marked by a solitary papule that ulcerates, but nodular lymphangitis can occasionally occur.  However, acid-fast bacilli, not yeasts, would be seen on culture. $#(Choice D)#  Prolonged antibiotic use can disrupt mucocutaneous flora, leading to Candida infection.  Although Candida is a yeast that buds, it generally causes intertriginous infection marked by erythematous plaques and erosions.  Nodular lymphangitis would be uncommon. $#(Choice E)#  Feline flea bite can transmit Bartonella henselae, the cause of catscratch disease.  Patients often develop a papule at the inoculation site, but the major symptom is extremely tender regional lymphadenitis.  Gram-negative rods, not yeasts, would be seen on culture. $#Educational objective# Sporothrix schenckii is a dimorphic fungus that exists as yeasts at body temperature.  It is found in decaying plant matter and soil and is usually transmitted via cutaneous or subcutaneous inoculation while a person is farming, gardening, or landscaping.

The tibia, fibula, and femur are most often involved.  Adults who develop the condition are more likely to have vertebral involvement and frequently have a predisposition to bacteremia due to risk factors such as IV drug abuse or indwelling vascular catheters. $The presenting symptoms of hematogenous osteomyelitis are vague, and a high index of suspicion is required to make the diagnosis.  Initial symptoms such as malaise and fevers are non-specific.  As the infection progresses, infants and younger children may refuse to move the affected extremity.  Older children often complain of pain over a long bone.  Bone pain develops as the abscess expands within the bone, leading to bone necrosis, periosteal disruption, and swelling of the surrounding soft tissue.  #Staphylococcus aureus# is implicated in most cases of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis in otherwise healthy children. $#(Choice A)#  Enterococcus faecalis causes a variety of infections, including endocarditis, meningitis, and urinary tract infections.  Enterococcus can cause vertebral osteomyelitis after a recent urinary tract infection via bacteremic spread. $#(Choice B)#  Moraxella catarrhalis is a part of the normal flora of the upper respiratory tract.

  "explanation_2": "Although this patient believes her back pain may be due to a muscle sprain, her presentation (localized bony back pain, low-grade fever, recent staphylococcal bacteremia) suggests #vertebral osteomyelitis#.  Bacteria can access the spine by hematogenous spread from a distant infection (eg, skin or soft tissue, intravenous catheter), direct invasion from trauma or local spinal procedures (eg, lumbar puncture, spinal surgery), or direct spread from adjacent soft tissue infection.  #Hematogenous# spread is most common as the adult vertebral bone has a very rich and vascular marrow.  Increasing age can cause the nutrient arteries to develop a \"corkscrew\" anatomy, which allows bacteria to more easily penetrate the marrow cavity and cause local infection. $#Bacteremia# due to intravascular devices (eg, hemodialysis catheters) increases risk of health care-related vertebral osteomyelitis.  Offending organisms include #Staphylococcus# (most common is S aureus or coagulase-negative staphylococci) and various gram-negative organisms (eg, Pseudomonas).

However, it is more invasive than MRI and usually reserved for patients who cannot undergo MRI (eg, those with pacemaker, metallic implants). $#(Choice C)#  Lumbar puncture is typically used for diagnosing meningitis and has a low yield for diagnosing vertebral osteomyelitis.  CT-guided bone biopsy is usually preferred for isolating the organism after imaging confirms the diagnosis of vertebral osteomyelitis. $#(Choice E)#  Serum protein electrophoresis is typically done to evaluate for monoclonal gammopathies (eg, multiple myeloma).  Although multiple myeloma can present with back pain, this patient's fever and recent bacteremia make vertebral osteomyelitis more likely. $#Educational objective# Vertebral osteomyelitis should be suspected in patients with new or worsening back pain, fever, and recent endocarditis or bacteremia (especially Staphylococcus aureus).

The thick filaments in skeletal muscle are comprised of myosin molecules, with the heads of the myosin molecules forming cross-links with actin during muscular contraction.  Two actin chains comprise the thin filaments in skeletal muscle.  Tropomyosin molecules sit in the groove between the two actin chains, covering the myosin binding sites on actin when the muscle is at rest.  Troponin molecules are small globular proteins situated alongside the tropomyosin molecules.  Troponin is composed of three subunits: troponin T, troponin I, and troponin C.  Troponin T binds the other troponin components to tropomyosin, troponin I binds the troponin-tropomyosin complex to actin, and troponin C contains the binding sites for Ca2+.  During excitation-contraction coupling, Ca2+ is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

  "explanation_2": "$#Transverse tubules# (T-tubules) are #invaginations# of the muscle cell membrane (#sarcolemma#) located in close proximity to the terminal cisterns of the sarcoplasmic reticulum.  They are found in striated (eg, cardiac, skeletal) muscle and contain voltage-gated L-type calcium channels (dihydropyridine receptors) adjacent to the ryanodine receptors on the terminal cisterns.  During muscle contraction, T-tubules allow the #depolarization# impulse to #rapidly propagate# through the interior of the muscle fiber.  This ensures that calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum occurs uniformly throughout the fiber, allowing for #synchronized contraction of myofibrils# in each muscle cell. $This patient most likely has a form of limb girdle muscular dystrophy due to a mutated sarcolemma protein (eg, caveolin) affecting excitation-contraction coupling.  Decreased numbers of functional T-tubules in affected muscle fibers lead to #uncoordinated# contraction of myofibrils, which manifests as muscle weakness. $#(Choice A)#  Decremental force generated on repeated stimulation characterizes myasthenia gravis, an autoantibody disorder inhibiting postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors in the neuromuscular junction.  A constant low response to repeated nerve stimulation is more likely if T-tubules are lacking. $#(Choice B)#  ATP fuels myosin movement along actin filaments (causing contraction) and drives the pumps that transport calcium back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (causing relaxation).  McArdle disease is one cause of impaired ATP production and occurs due to a failure of muscle glycogen breakdown. $#(Choice C)#  Impaired relaxation after sustained contraction occurs in myotonic dystrophy due to a trinucleotide repeat expansion altering myotonin-protein kinase.  This protein facilitates myosin head detachment from the actin filament to enable muscle relaxation; T-tubules do not play a role. $#(Choice D)#  A mutation in @troponin C@ may block its response to intracellular calcium and prevent muscle contraction.  However, muscle fibers with decreased numbers of T-tubules will maintain limited contractility. $#Educational objective# Transverse tubules (T-tubules) are invaginations of the sarcolemma that transmit depolarization signals to the sarcoplasmic reticulum to trigger the release of calcium and induce muscle contraction.  The uniform distribution of T-tubules in striated muscle fibers ensures that each myofibril contracts at the same time, which is necessary for efficient contraction.  ",

However, calcium-modulated regulatory complexes of troponin-C and tropomyosin prevent filament interaction by occluding binding sites on actin.  The sarcoplasmic reticulum actively resorbs calcium at rest through an ATP-driven channel (SERCA). $• Depolarization of skeletal muscle allows the SR to release calcium.  This stimulates troponin-tropomyosin complexes to open access, allowing the myosin head to perpendicularly bind actin (cross-bridge formation). $• The bound head releases Pi and bends the cross-bridge 45°, increasing filament overlap and shortening the sarcomere length.  Once the process is completed, ADP is released. $• A new #ATP# molecule must bind the myosin head to #dissolve the cross-bridge#, returning the head to its original position to restart the cycle. $• Cycling continues while both calcium and ATP are readily available; continued cycling across multiple heads further increases actin-myosin overlap, increasing or maintaining contraction.  Once the stimulation for contraction dissipates, calcium is resorbed by the sarcoplasmic reticulum and the muscle relaxes. $After death occurs and respiration ceases, ATP stores quickly deplete.  Intracellular calcium levels rapidly rise without ATP maintaining sarcoplasmic storage, triggering cross-bridge formation.  Since #cross-bridges cannot dissolve# without ATP, this results in #muscle stiffening# that spreads across the deceased patient's body during the first 12 hours after death. $#(Choices A, B, and E)#  Calcium binding to troponin-C shifts tropomyosin away from myosin binding sites, facilitating cross-bridge formation.  Failure of these processes prevents muscle contraction. $#(Choice D)#  Smooth muscle cells use myosin light chain kinase to phosphorylate the myosin head to trigger contraction.  However, myosin head phosphorylation is not necessary for skeletal muscle contraction. $#Educational objective# Muscle contraction involves continuous actin-myosin cross-bridge cycling driven by release of sarcoplasmic calcium stores.  After death, loss of ATP prevents both myosin head detachment and clearance of cytoplasmic calcium, leading to diffuse and persistent skeletal muscle stiffening (rigor mortis).  "

  "explanation_2": "$Synthesis of vitamin D begins in the skin with the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) by ultraviolet light.  Cholecalciferol is subsequently converted to 25-hydroxyvitamin D (the primary body store of vitamin D) by 25-hydroxylase in the liver.  Finally, #25-hydroxyvitamin D# is filtered by renal glomeruli (with vitamin D-binding protein) and delivered to proximal tubule cells, where 1-alpha-hydroxylase converts it to #1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D#, the physiologically active form.  The activity of 1-alpha-hydroxylase is upregulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH) and inhibited by fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a peptide secreted by osteocytes in response to high levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. $#Chronic kidney disease# (CKD) results in impaired conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D due to the following factors: $• FGF23 levels increase early in CKD, causing direct inhibition of 1-alpha-hydroxylase $• Reduced glomerular filtration limits the delivery of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to proximal tubule cells $• Reduced functional renal mass limits production of 1-alpha-hydroxylase $Inadequate production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D causes reduced intestinal absorption of calcium.  This, along with increased phosphate retention (due to impaired glomerular and tubular function), leads to a compensatory increase in parathyroid hormone secretion (#secondary hyperparathyroidism#).  Chronically increased PTH levels have a deleterious effect on bone metabolism (#renal osteodystrophy#), and can cause weakness, bone and muscle pain, defective bone mineralization, and an increased risk of fractures. $#(Choice A)#  The initial step in vitamin D synthesis is driven by ultraviolet exposure in the skin.  Factors that can lead to vitamin D deficiency include inadequate sunlight exposure (eg, institutionalized elders, living at extreme latitudes), use of high-grade sunblock, nocturnal occupations, and heavily pigmented skin. $#(Choice B)#  25-Hydroxyvitamin D deficiency due to inadequate 25-hydroxylase activity can be seen in patients with liver disease, but is uncommon and primarily seen in those with advanced cirrhosis. $#(Choices D and E)#  Vitamin D-24-hydroxylase converts 25- and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D into inactive 24-hydroxylated metabolites; it functions to degrade excess levels of vitamin D.  Although it is expressed predominantly in the kidneys and may be impaired in chronic kidney disease, loss of this enzyme would lead to higher 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels and so would reduce, rather than worsen, the patient's symptoms. $#Educational objective# In chronic kidney disease, conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is impaired.  In addition, failure of glomerular and tubular function results in phosphate retention and hypocalcemia.  This leads to a compensatory rise in parathyroid hormone (secondary hyperparathyroidism) that can present with weakness, muscle and joint pain, defective bone mineralization, and increased fracture risk.

GTOs are connected in series with the contracting extrafusal skeletal muscle fibers.  When a muscle actively contracts against resistance, the increase in tension is transmitted through the tendon activating the GTOs in the process.  In contrast, GTOs are relatively insensitive to changes in muscle length because the lengthening that occurs when a muscle is passively stretched takes place primarily in the muscle fibers and not in the tendon. $The Ib sensory axons from the GTOs contact inhibitory interneurons in the spinal cord, which in turn synapse with the α motor neurons that innervate the same muscle.

The new bone formation is disorganized, and pagetic bone lesions typically appear on imaging as thickened areas of mixed sclerosis and lucency. $Osteoblasts are cells with a single nucleus that arise from mesenchymal stem cells found in the periosteum and bone marrow.  In contrast, #osteoclasts# originate from the mononuclear phagocytic cell lineage and are ultimately formed when several precursor cells fuse to create a #multinucleated# mature cell.  Osteoclasts in Paget's disease are typically very large and can have up to 100 nuclei (normal osteoclasts have 2-5).  The 2 most important factors for osteoclastic differentiation, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (#M-CSF#) and receptor for activated nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (#RANK-L#), are produced by osteoblasts and bone marrow stromal cells. $Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a physiologic decoy receptor that decreases binding of RANK-L to RANK.  Inhibition of RANK-L to RANK receptor interaction reduces the differentiation and survival of osteoclasts, resulting in decreased bone resorption and increased bone density #(choice C).#  OPG loss-of-function mutations cause juvenile Paget's disease.  A monoclonal antibody (denosumab) that inhibits the RANK/RANK-L interaction also leads to increased bone density and is commonly used for the treatment of osteoporosis. $#(Choice A)#  Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) regulate chondrogenesis and osteogenesis.  FGFs induce proliferation of osteoblastic precursor cells and anabolic function of mature osteoblasts.  Abnormalities in the FGF receptor result in the congenital short-limbed dwarfism known as achondroplasia. $#(Choice B)#  Insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I and IGF-II) are synthesized by various tissues, including the liver and bone.  IGF-I increases osteoblastic replication and collagen synthesis; it also decreases collagen degradation by inhibiting the enzyme matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13).  The net effect of IGF-I on the bone is anabolic. $#(Choice E)#  Transforming growth factor beta increases the replication of osteoblast precursors, leading to increased formation of mature osteoblasts.  Transforming growth factor beta also increases collagen synthesis and decreases bone resorption by increasing osteoclastic apoptosis. $#Educational objective# Osteoclasts originate from hematopoietic progenitor cells.  Macrophage colony-stimulating factor and receptor for activated nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANK-L) play an important role in osteoclast differentiation.  Paget's disease of bone is characterized by increased numbers of abnormal osteoclasts, excessive bone turnover and disorganized bone remodeling.  ",

Melanocytes synthesize melanin from tyrosine via the enzyme tyrosinase. $#Educational objective# Alkaptonuria is an autosomal-recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of homogentisic acid dioxygenase, an enzyme involved in tyrosine metabolism.  Excess homogentisic acid causes diffuse blue-black deposits in connective tissues.  Adults have sclerae and ear cartilage hyperpigmentation along with osteoarthropathy of the spine and large joints.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient with seizures and a cerebral infarction has muscle biopsy findings showing irregularly shaped fibers on Gomori trichome staining (ie, #ragged red fibers#), which represent the accumulation of abnormal mitochondria.  These findings are diagnostic of #mitochondrial encephalomyopathy#. $Although most mitochondrial proteins are coded for in the nuclear genome, mitochondria also synthesize their own proteins from mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).  Because mtDNA is inherited almost exclusively from the mother, mitochondrial disorders frequently exhibit a #maternal inheritance pattern#, as seen in this pedigree in which all offspring of an affected mother have disease and all offspring of an affected father are unaffected. $Because each cell contains hundreds of mitochondria and each mitochondrion contains several copies of its own genome, mitochondria with #normal and mutant genomes# often #coexist# in the same cell, a condition known as #heteroplasmy#.  In those with mitochondrial disorders, the degree of heteroplasmy varies randomly, leading to a #range of phenotypes#, even within the same family; the proportion of mutant to normal mitochondria correlates with symptom severity. $Due to the impairment in oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial defects tend to cause lactic acidosis and primarily affect tissues with the highest metabolic rates (eg, brain, muscle).  In this case, the family likely has MELAS, or #M#itochondrial #E#ncephalopathy, #L#actic #A#cidosis, and #S#troke-like episodes. $#(Choice A)#  Anticipation refers to the earlier onset and/or increased severity of an inherited disease over successive generations.  It often occurs in autosomal and X-linked trinucleotide repeat disorders, not mitochondrial disease, due to trinucleotide amplification during gametogenesis. $#(Choice C)#  Locus heterogeneity describes mutations that occur at different loci (ie, different genotypes) but cause similar phenotypes.  In contrast, family members affected by a mitochondrial disease likely have the same genotype but a variable phenotype due to heteroplasmy. $#(Choice D)#  Mosaicism refers to the presence of ≥2 cell lines, each with a unique nuclear genome, within an individual.  Although patients with germline mosaicism can have affected offspring, a maternal inheritance pattern would not be expected. $#(Choice E)#  Uniparental disomy occurs when both copies of a chromosome are inherited from one parent.  For chromosomes containing genes in which an allele derived from a specific parent is normally imprinted (silenced), inheritance of 2 copies of this chromosome can result in absent gene expression, as in Prader-Willi or Angelman syndrome. $#Educational objective# Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy is characterized by ragged red fibers on muscle biopsy and a maternal inheritance pattern.  Clinical presentation in affected family members varies due to the degree of heteroplasmy, or proportion of mitochondria with normal and mutant genomes in the same cell or tissue.  "

  "explanation_2": "$This patient has a mutation in a gene that regulates craniocaudal body patterning in utero, or a #homeobox (HOX) gene#.  HOX genes are highly conserved DNA sequences that #regulate positioning# of embryonic structures.  There is a spatial relationship between the location of the homeobox gene and its expression along the #craniocaudal axis#:  genes located near the 3′ end gene cluster express cranially, and genes located near the 5′ end gene cluster express caudally. $HOX genes code for #transcription factors# that #bind regulatory regions# on DNA of target genes involved in the segmental organization of the embryo.

This patient has webbing between digits (syndactyly) and a supernumerary finger in between (polydactyly) due to a mutation in HOXD13, a homeobox gene that regulates limb development. $#(Choice A)#  Alternative splicing of pre-mRNA may occur during aberrant homeobox gene expression, contributing to congenital malformation.  However, homeobox genes themselves do not regulate body patterning by alternative splicing. $#(Choices C and D)#  Modulation of DNA methylation or histone acetylation patterns (ie, epigenetic modification) can result in altered gene expression without any change in the DNA sequence.  Epigenetic changes can be inherited by daughter cells, and are responsible for normal cellular differentiation and X-chromosome inactivation.  Activation of oncogenes via histone acetylation and/or inactivation of tumor suppressor genes by DNA methylation also occur during the development of nearly all cancers.  Although homeobox genes influence epigenetic modification, they function directly as transcription factors. $#(Choice E)#  Regulation of protein synthesis at the translational level can occur via phosphorylation of various initiation, elongation, and release factors.  Homeobox genes regulate body patterning by targeting transcription, not translation. $#Educational objective# Homeobox genes code for transcription factors that bind regulatory regions on target genes involved in the segmental organization of the embryo along the craniocaudal body axis.
