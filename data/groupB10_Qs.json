The positive serology for #syphilis# (positive fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption [FTA-ABS] test) suggests a 'luetic' aneurysm, consistent with tertiary syphilis. $#Tertiary syphilis# begins with #vasa vasorum endarteritis# and obliteration, resulting in inflammation, ischemia, and weakening of the adventitia.  Aneurysmal dilation of the thoracic aorta results and can extend to involve the aortic valve ring.  Syphilitic aneurysms are uncommon in the United States. $#(Choice A)#  Intimal streaks are the earliest lesions of atherosclerosis.  Severe, complicated intimal atheromas can destroy and weaken the underlying media, resulting in aortic aneurysms.  However, the most common site of these lesions is in the abdominal aorta (below the origin of the renal arteries).  Although atherosclerosis can promote aneurysm formation in the thoracic aorta, the positive FTA-ABS test makes atherosclerosis less likely to be the cause of this patient's symptoms. $#(Choices B and C)#  Intimal tear and medial degeneration (elastic tissue fragmentation and separation of the elastic and fibromuscular components of the tunica media by small, cleft-like spaces) are common histopathologic abnormalities seen with aortic dissections (severe chest pain radiating to the back), not aortic aneurysms. $#(Choice D)#  Large vessel arteritides with medial inflammation (eg, Takayasu, giant cell arteritis) might rarely promote an aortic aneurysm; however, they are not associated with a positive serology for syphilis. $#Educational objective# Tertiary syphilis can result in thoracic aortic aneurysm.  If the aneurysm compresses adjacent structures and dilates the aortic valve ring, a murmur and mediastinal widening might be present.  The pathogenesis begins with vasa vasorum endarteritis and obliteration, resulting in inflammation, ischemia, and weakening of the aortic adventitia.  Fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption testing is specific for syphilis.  "

Although BV is not a sexually transmitted infection, it is associated with sexual activity (due to alterations of the vaginal flora from semen or contraceptives [eg, spermicide]). $Patients with BV commonly have a #thin, gray or clear# malodorous vaginal discharge.  The discharge's odor becomes more prominent when #potassium hydroxide (KOH)# is added to a sample (#whiff test#) because of the volatilization of #amines# produced by G vaginalis and other anaerobes.  #Clue cells# on wet mount microscopy are also characteristic. $#Clindamycin# and #metronidazole# are effective treatments for BV.  Clindamycin is a bacteriostatic drug that inhibits protein translation by binding to the 50s ribosomal subunit.  Metronidazole is bactericidal and damages the DNA of anaerobes; it is typically avoided with concurrent use of alcohol due to a disulfiram-like reaction (eg, vomiting, flushing). $#(Choice A)#  Chlamydia trachomatis is an intracellular, gram-negative bacterium that can infect the columnar epithelium of the cervix (eg, cervicitis) and urethra, in addition to the lungs and eyes.  Diagnosis is with nucleic acid amplification testing, and treatment is with azithromycin, a bacteriostatic macrolide antibiotic. $#(Choice B)#  Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a gram-negative diplococcus that infects the genital mucosa (eg, cervicitis, urethritis) and is diagnosed with gram stain of discharge or nucleic acid amplification testing.  It is treated with ceftriaxone (a third-generation cephalosporin that inhibits cell wall biosynthesis) monotherapy in the setting of negative testing for Chlamydia, and ceftriaxone plus doxycycline when Chlamydia coinfection is present. $#(Choice D)#  Vulvovaginal candidiasis is typically due to Candida albicans, which causes vaginal pruritus, labial erythema, and a white, curd-like discharge.  KOH examination shows yeast forms and pseudohyphae.  Treatment is with azole antifungals (eg, fluconazole), which block ergosterol synthesis. $#(Choice E)#  Syphilis causes a painless chancre (not vaginal discharge), followed by a rash and systemic symptoms; it is caused by the gram-negative spirochete Treponema pallidum.  It is treated with penicillin, a bactericidal beta-lactam antibiotic that inhibits cell wall synthesis. $#Educational objective# Bacterial vaginosis causes a thin, gray or clear, malodorous discharge from overgrowth of anaerobes (eg, Gardnerella vaginalis) and a loss of lactobacilli in the vaginal flora.

      "explanation_2": "This patient's presentation suggests #parotitis#, an acute viral or bacterial infection of the parotid gland.  Acute bacterial suppurative parotitis can be due to #Staphylococcus aureus# (most common) or mixed oral aerobes/anaerobes.  Risk factors include #dehydration, intubation# (elderly postoperative patients), medications that decrease salivary flow (eg, #anticholinergics#), salivary flow obstruction (eg, salivary #calculi#, oral cavitary neoplasm), or recent intense teeth cleaning. $Suppurative parotitis usually presents with acute onset of firm and erythematous pre/postauricular #swelling# that extends to the mandible.  Patients can also develop trismus, dysphagia, and systemic findings (eg, fever, chills).  The diagnosis can be confirmed by #imaging# (eg, ultrasound, @CT@) showing parotid duct inflammation, obstruction by a stone, or sometimes abscess.  As the parotid gland secretes #amylase#, suppurative parotitis can present with elevated serum amylase.  However, affected patients have normal serum lipase levels without clinical evidence of pancreatitis #(Choice D)#. $#(Choice A)#  Alkaline phosphatase is an enzyme that hydrolyzes and removes phosphate from other compounds (eg, proteins, enzymes).  It is mainly found in the bone, liver, bile ducts, and placenta.  Alkaline phosphatase can be elevated in biliary conditions, bone disease (eg, osteomalacia), and leukemia/lymphoma.  However, it is usually not affected by parotitis. $#(Choice C)#  Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) helps convert glutathione to glutamate.  It can be found in many organs, including the liver.  GGT elevation suggests that alkaline phosphatase elevation is due to liver (not bone) pathology. $#(Choice E)#  Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is secreted by the chief cells of the parathyroid gland and increases serum calcium to maintain calcium homeostasis.  PTH has effects on the kidney and bone but is not elevated with parotitis. $#Educational objective# Acute bacterial parotitis occurs more commonly in elderly postoperative patients who are intubated or dehydrated.  Staphylococcus aureus is the most common bacterial etiology.  Diagnosis can be confirmed by imaging and an elevated serum amylase level (with a normal serum lipase level and no evidence of pancreatitis).  ",

Tuberculin skin testing (#TST#) is generally positive in patients with active TB because differentiated lymphocytes recognize injected tuberculin antigens and trigger a strong type IV (cell-mediated) hypersensitivity response, leading to a large wheal of induration within 48-72 hours. $However, approximately 25% of patients with active TB have #false negative TST# (T cell #anergy#).  In these individuals, an #impaired lymphocyte response# results in minimal or no induration after exposure to tuberculin antigens.  Because a weak cell-mediated response increases the #risk of severe disseminated TB#, patients with active disease who have TST anergy are at much greater risk for TB-related morbidity and mortality. $A false-negative TST can also be seen with recent infection (it takes approximately 8 weeks for the cell mediated response to fully form), immunocompromise (eg, HIV), improper injection technique, and natural waning of immunity to latent infection.  Because active TB requires a microbial diagnosis (eg, identifying the organism on sputum sample), neither TST nor interferon-gamma release assay can be used to diagnose or exclude the disease. $#(Choice A)#  Bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccination uses Mycobacterium bovis, which shares antigens with tuberculous mycobacteria.  This vaccination primes the lymphocyte response against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, therefore protecting against infection, morbidity, and mortality.  Patients with previous BCG vaccination can have false-positive (not false negative) TST. $#(Choice B)#  TB infection is primarily controlled by macrophages and T lymphocytes.  The humoral immune system plays a minimal role and does not contribute to TST induration.  Therefore, an autoantibody disorder is unlikely to cause anergy. $#(Choice D)#  Examination of the injection site should occur 48-72 hours after the purified protein derivative is injected in order to give appropriate time for the delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to develop.  Patients with active TB who have a negative TST at 72 hours are likely to have an insufficient lymphocyte response to the infection. $#(Choice E)#  Acid-fast bacillus stain and TST do not differentiate nontuberculous from tuberculous mycobacteria.  Therefore, nontuberculous mycobacterial infection is a common cause of a false-positive (not a false-negative) TST.  This patient's history of residence in a TB-endemic country, hemoptysis, night sweats, and upper lobe infiltrate are all highly suspicious for pulmonary TB. $#Educational objective# Approximately 25% of patients with active TB have false-negative tuberculin skin testing (TST) (anergy) due to an impaired cell-mediated immune response.

  "explanation_2": "#Clostridium tetani# is a thin, gram-positive rod with a round terminal spore that grows in strict anaerobic conditions.  It is found in the gastrointestinal tract of many mammals and in soil worldwide.  Transmission to humans typically occurs when C tetani spores are inoculated into a #skin wound#.  In the anaerobic microenvironment, the spores germinate into a vegetative rod and replicate locally. $Growing C tetani bacteria produce a neurotoxic exotoxin called #tetanospasmin# (tetanus toxin) that travels by retrograde axonal transport through the lower motor neurons to the central nervous system.  There, it acts at the level of the anterior horn cells, #blocking inhibitory neurotransmission#, which results in the clinical syndrome of #tetanus#.  Manifestations include increased muscle tone (eg, @opisthotonos@, lockjaw), painful spasms, and autonomic instability. $In the United States, the #tetanus toxoid vaccine# (formaldehyde-inactivated tetanus toxin) is part of routine childhood vaccinations.  This vaccine stimulates a #humoral antibody response# against tetanus toxin that prevents the toxin from causing neurological damage.  Tetanus is very rare in those who have been vaccinated; almost all cases occur in unvaccinated individuals or those who have not received appropriate booster vaccines. $#(Choice A)#  Activated macrophages engulf and digest foreign microbes and are the principal cell type responsible for granuloma formation.  Although macrophages help clear bacteria locally from the wound, they would not be able to neutralize the tetanus toxin secreted by Clostridium tetani. $#(Choice B)#  Circulating antibodies bind to extracellular pathogens and promote complement fixation and phagocytosis.  Complement can opsonize and help eliminate extracellular bacteria, but it would not impair the activity of tetanus toxin. $#(Choice D)#  Neutrophils are responsible for phagocytosis of foreign organisms and are part of the initial response against extracellular pathogens.  These cells are important for controlling bacterial infections, but play no role in neutralizing tetanus toxin molecules. $#(Choice E)#  Cytotoxic CD8 lymphocytes play an important role in host defense against viral infections.  They are also capable of destroying tumor cells and contribute to rejection reactions. $#Educational objective# Clostridium tetani produces the neurotoxin tetanospasmin, which blocks inhibitory neurotransmission in the spinal cord and leads to tonic muscular contraction.  Tetanus is prevented by immunization with an inactivated toxoid that triggers the production of antitoxin antibodies (active immunity). ",

  "explanation_2": "$Although B cells are the primary players in inducing a #vaccine response#, T cells play a key role in enabling high-affinity antibodies and immunological memory.  Most vaccinations use peptide antigens or nonpeptides bonded to peptides (ie, conjugate vaccine) so the antigen can be displayed on MHC class II molecules on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), which leads to a much stronger T-cell–mediated immune response. $Vaccines given in series (eg, measles, mumps, and rubella) typically trigger the following immunologic changes: $• #Primary response#:  Upon initial vaccination, foreign antigen binds to and activates B lymphocytes with compatible antigen receptors, leading to clonal B-cell expansion and differentiation into #short-lived plasma cells# that secrete low-affinity IgM.  #Early production of IgM# can be detected in the serum within a few days of immunization.  APCs also ingest the peptide and travel to regional lymph nodes where they stimulate CD4 T lymphocytes to interact with activated B cells.  This interaction facilitates #immunoglobulin class switching# from IgM to other types (eg, IgG, IgA) and stimulates B-cell differentiation into memory B cells.  Plasma cells secrete #high-affinity IgG#, and levels peak a few weeks after immunization (#after IgM peaks#) before slowly waning #(choices B and E)#. $• #Secondary response#:  subsequent vaccination or pathogen exposure results in a #IgM response similar to initial vaccination# due to stimulation of antigen-specific naïve B lymphocytes.  However, the previously formed #memory B cells# quickly differentiate into long-lasting plasma cells to produce a #rapid and sustained IgG# response that peaks around the same time as the IgM response but is greater in magnitude #(choices C and D)#.  IgG rapidly neutralizes invading organisms and is responsible for the protective effects of the vaccine. $#Educational objective# Initial vaccination generates an early IgM response by short-lived plasma cells followed by a delayed-onset, longer-lasting IgG response due to T-cell dependent class switching (IgM peaks before IgG).  Due to formation of memory B cells, secondary responses (eg, booster vaccination, pathogen exposure) are characterized by a rapid and sustained IgG response with a short-term, more muted IgM response.

Anaphylactic shock is typically characterized by hypotension, bronchospasm, and shortness of breath; most cases are triggered by insect stings, food, or medications, and manifestations occur shortly after exposure. $#(Choice D)#  Patients who develop TSS usually have a noninvasive infection in the vaginal canal or area of wound packing.  TSS is mediated by the absorption of superantigens into the blood, not the invasion of bacteria. $#Educational objective# Toxic shock syndrome is typically associated with the prolonged use of tampons or wound packing, which allows Staphylococcus aureus to replicate locally and release pyrogenic toxic superantigens (eg, toxic shock syndrome toxin-1) into the blood.

Because the virus infects host cells, it produces a long-lasting humoral and cell-mediated immune response against a diverse range of viral antigens that mirrors that of a normal infection. $• #Inactivated vaccinations# introduce viral fragments that are taken up by antigen presenting cells and displayed to B and T lymphocytes.  However, because the virus does not replicate with host cells, they tend to elicit a short-acting humoral immune response and less robust cell-mediated response; multiple doses and booster shots are often required to provide effective immunity. $Although live attenuated and inactivated virus immunizations are effective, their #development requires years# or decades and is often more difficult for nonmicrobial antigens (eg, cancer cell antigens).

Each seasonal influenza vaccine contains antigens (or attenuated virions) from 3 or 4 influenza A and B virus strains.  Antigens from multiple influenza types are included in the vaccine because antibodies against 1 strain confer limited or no protection against the others.  #Annual vaccination# is recommended due to waning effectiveness over time and because circulating strains of influenza change from year to year.  All individuals age >6 months should be immunized, especially health care workers and those at risk of serious complications such as the elderly, patients with chronic illness (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and immunocompromised individuals. $Inactivated versions of the influenza vaccine stimulate the formation of #neutralizing antibodies# against the #hemagglutinin antigen# of included strains.  Subsequent exposure to a strain of influenza included in the vaccine will not result in infection because the antibodies bind to hemagglutinin, thereby preventing hemagglutinin from attaching to the sialic acid receptor on host respiratory epithelial cells (#preventing viral entry#). $#(Choice A)#  Because inactivated viral vaccines do not infect host cells, they are not processed by the @MHC class I pathway@ and do not stimulate a potent CD8+ T-cell response.  In contrast, live attenuated influenza vaccines replicate in nasopharyngeal cells and are displayed on MHC class I molecules, thereby generating a strong cytotoxic T-cell response that results in the destruction of the infected cell. $#(Choices B and E)#  Protective antibodies against influenza primarily target the surface glycoproteins and impair viral entry.  Immunization does not typically affect viral genomic replication or assembly, which occurs in the interior of the cell and cannot be targeted easily by an antibody response. $#(Choice C)#  Neuraminidase cleaves the terminal sialic acid residues on glycoconjugate receptors, which releases influenza virions from infected cells.  Oseltamivir is a sialic acid analogue that competitively inhibits influenza neuraminidase, which prevents release of viral progeny. $#Educational objective# Inactivated (killed or component) viral vaccines primarily generate a humoral immune response against extracellular viral antigens, preventing viral entry into the cell.  In contrast, live attenuated viral vaccines can generate a strong cell-mediated immune response that can kill virally-infected cells, in addition to providing humoral immunity.  ",

  "explanation_2": "Serologic evidence of #hepatitis B virus# (HBV) exposure is present in approximately 2 billion people worldwide.  Nearly 250 million of these individuals have chronic infection and can transmit the virus to others.  Perinatal transmission is most common in high prevalence countries (eg, sub-Saharan Africa); unprotected sex or intravenous drug use causes most infections in low-incidence countries (eg, United States).  #Health care providers# are at #high risk# for infection due to potential exposure to the blood of infected patients. $HBV #vaccination #is recommended for all health care providers and other high-risk individuals (eg, intravenous drug users).  The vaccine utilizes #recombinant HBsAg# to generate protective immunity against the virus.  HBsAg is a collection of envelope glycoproteins found on the surface of HBV; these glycoproteins mediate attachment of the virus to hepatocytes and subsequent viral entry.  Patients who adequately respond to the HBV vaccine generate #anti-HBs antibodies#, which bind to circulating viral particles and prevent attachment to and penetration of hepatocytes. $Patients who have been immunized against HBV as well as those who have cleared the virus after acute infection will have anti-HBs antibodies.  These 2 populations are distinguished by the presence of anti-HBc antibodies, which are seen only in those who have been exposed to the virus (not in immunized patients). $#(Choice A)#  The immunity conferred by the hepatitis B vaccination is mediated by protective antibodies against HBsAg; the protective effects are not due to activation of cytotoxic T cells.  However, in patients exposed to HBV, the resolution of acute infection is mediated primarily by a vigorous, polyclonal cytotoxic T-cell response that destroys infected hepatocytes. $#(Choice B)#  HIV treatment often includes nucleotide and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, which disrupt viral genome replication.  Hepatitis C virus is often treated with similar medications (eg, sofosbuvir) that target viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.  Immunization against HBV does not interfere with replication of the HBV genome. $#(Choice C)#  HBV is considered a stealth virus because it possesses virulence factors that block portions of the innate immune system, including the release of interferon-gamma from infected cells.  However, HBV immunization does not significantly affect the innate immune system. $#(Choice E)#  NS5A inhibitors (eg, ledipasvir) are thought to block hepatitis C virus replication and assembly.  HBV immunization generates protective antibodies against the HBsAg; it does not affect viral assembly. $#Educational objective# Immunization against hepatitis B virus uses recombinant HBsAg to generate anti-HBs antibodies.  These antibodies prevent infection by binding to the envelope of circulating virus and inhibiting viral entry.  "

  "explanation_2": "This patient underwent cytotoxic chemotherapy and subsequently developed a bloodstream infection with #Candida albicans#, a small, elliptical, budding yeast.  Visualization of #pseudohyphae#, a chain of budding yeasts joined together with end-to-end at constrictions, is an important diagnostic clue.  C albicans is distinguished from other Candida species by its ability to form #germ tubes# (true hyphae with no constrictions) when incubated at 37 C (98.6 F) for 2-3 hours (ie, germ tube test). $C albicans is a human commensal organism that may cause mucocutaneous infection in otherwise healthy individuals but rarely causes invasive disease.  Protection against infection is mediated by the following: $• Intact epithelium:  Candida triggers toll-like receptors on epithelial cells to release proinflammatory cytokines, which recruit immune cells to the area; epithelial cells also release beta-defensins, which provide antifungal activity. $• Resident macrophages/monocytes:  Penetration of epithelial cells by fungal hyphae causes resident macrophages to release inflammatory cytokines that recruit lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils to the area of infection.  #T helper lymphocytes# specific for Candida antigens help drive the epithelial and macrophage response, and are important for prevention of #superficial Candida infection# (eg, oral/esophageal, cutaneous, vulvovaginitis). $• #Neutrophils:#  Neutrophils are the most important immune cell in the protection against #invasive Candida# (eg, candidemia, deep tissue infections).  Neutrophils kill Candida by releasing reactive oxygen species, lactoferrin, lysozyme, elastase, and beta-defensins.  They are also the only immune cell that is able to prevent germination of Candida yeasts into penetrating hyphae. $Patients who undergo cytotoxic chemotherapy and develop #neutropenia# are at dramatically increased risk for invasive infection.  Indwelling central intravascular catheters are also a major risk factor for invasive disease. $#(Choice A)#  Early complement proteins (eg, C3b, C5b) assist opsonization, and late complement proteins (C5-C9) form the membrane attack complex.  Complement is crucial for control of bacterial infections, but it plays a minimal role in the control of Candida.  In addition, complement levels are not particularly diminished by chemotherapy. $#(Choice B)#  Candida is primarily controlled by neutrophils, macrophages, and helper T cells; immunoglobulins have more of an adjunctive role.  In addition, immunoglobulin levels are not typically affected by most cytotoxic chemotherapy because memory B cells are long lasting and have low rates of cellular division. $#(Choice C)#  Although chemotherapy impairs the production of granulocytes, which include eosinophils, basophils, and neutrophils, transient reduction in eosinophil and basophil count does not drastically increase risk of infection. $#(Choice E)#  T lymphocytes (particularly Th1 and Th17 subtypes) primarily prevent superficial Candida infection by strengthening the mucosal immune defense; conditions that impair cell-mediated immunity (eg, HIV) are associated with higher risk of mucocutaneous Candida infection (eg, thrush, esophagitis).  However, protection against invasive disease is mediated primarily by neutrophils, not lymphocytes. $#Educational objective# Neutrophils are the most important immune cell in the defense against invasive Candida infection; therefore, patients with neutropenia (eg, following cytotoxic chemotherapy) are at high risk for invasive disease (eg, candidemia, meningitis).  In contrast, T lymphocytes are more important for prevention of superficial, mucocutaneous infection (eg, thrush).  "

  "explanation_2": "$Leprosy is a chronic, slowly progressive, communicable disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae that typically involves the skin and peripheral nerves.  Clinical manifestations are widely variable depending on the strength of the TH1 cell-mediated immune response to the organism.  Disease is classified along a spectrum between tuberculoid (mild) to lepromatous (severe) forms.  Patients with tuberculoid leprosy develop a strong TH1-mediated response (interleukin [IL]-2, IFN-γ, and IL-12) in affected tissues, leading to the activation of macrophages that kill M leprae organisms, thereby limiting disease extent.  However, this localized inflammation damages the skin and cutaneous nerves, leading to the development of a small number of hypopigmented, well-demarcated plaques with decreased sensation. $Lepromatous leprosy is a more disseminated form of the disease characterized by an innate inability to recognize and mount a cellular immune response against M leprae antigens.  Affected tissues show extensive accumulation of acid-fast bacilli within macrophages and often a TH2 cytokine profile (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10).  Patients with lepromatous leprosy develop more numerous, poorly demarcated plaques that are widespread across the body.  Over time, the bacterial load increases and the nodular lesions coalesce, causing the development of leonine facies and degeneration and loss of the nose and digits. $The lepromin skin test (in which M leprae antigens are injected intradermally) can be used to distinguish between tuberculoid and lepromatous leprosy.  Patients with tuberculoid leprosy will develop an indurated nodule at the site of the injection (much like a positive PPD test for M tuberculosis).  In contrast, the test is usually nonreactive in patients with lepromatous leprosy due to their weak TH1 cell-mediated immune response. $#(Choice A)#  Patients with lepromatous leprosy have a high bacterial load with widespread involvement throughout the peripheral (cooler) tissues of the body.  As a result, intermittent bacteremia often occurs in the later stages of the disease.  However, this patient's few lesions and positive lepromin skin test are more indicative of tuberculoid leprosy, which has a very low bacterial load with limited tissue involvement. $#(Choice B)#  High serum antimycobacterial antibody levels are more frequently seen in lepromatous leprosy than tuberculous leprosy.  Because M leprae resides mostly within macrophages, circulating immunoglobulins have little access to the organism and are unable to bind, opsonize, or fix complement.  Humoral immunity does not influence the positivity of the lepromin skin test. $#(Choice C)#  In lepromatous leprosy, macrophages remain inactivated due to the inability of TH1 cells to recognize M leprae antigens.  This form of leprosy is characterized by a poor cell-mediated response and diffuse spread of the organism.  This patient is presenting with the tuberculoid form, in which activated macrophages actively kill M leprae organisms. $#(Choice E)#  Acid-fast bacteria typically do not accumulate in the skin lesions of tuberculoid leprosy due to the strong cell-mediated response that is effective at eradicating M leprae.  In some instances, this immune response is so effective that tuberculoid leprosy can be self-limited and heal completely without treatment. $#Educational objective# The lepromin skin test will be positive in patients with tuberculoid leprosy as they exhibit a strong CD4+ TH1 cell-mediated immune response to Mycobacterium leprae.  Patients with lepromatous leprosy will test negative due to their weak TH1 cell-mediated immune response.  "

The viral DNA then enters the nucleus and, through the actions of #integrase#, permanently #inserts into# the host cell's #chromosomes# to become a provirus.  RNA polymerase II then transcribes viral mRNA from the proviral DNA.  Once synthesized, HIV mRNA exits through the nuclear pores into the cytoplasm, where it uses the host cell's ribosomes to translate the enzymes, glycoproteins, structural proteins, and regulatory proteins needed to promote viral replication and transmission.  The full-length mRNA also serves as the viral genome that is packaged into newly synthesized virions. $#Raltegravir# is an #integrase inhibitor# that disrupts the ability of double-stranded HIV DNA to integrate into the host cell's chromosomes.  In the absence of integration, the #viral genome# #cannot be transcribed# by host cellular machinery and is eventually degraded by nucleases. $#(Choice A)#  Most of the proteins necessary for HIV replication are translated into a polyprotein precursor that is then cleaved into individual proteins by viral and cellular protease enzymes.  The action of viral protease can be directly prevented by protease inhibitors such as saquinavir. $#(Choice B)#  Complementary DNA synthesis from the HIV RNA template is directly impaired by nucleoside and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. $#(Choice C)#  Drugs that bind to gp41, HIV's transmembrane envelope protein, are known as fusion inhibitors (eg, enfuvirtide).  These drugs prevent gp41 from undergoing the conformational changes necessary for viral membrane fusion with the host cell membrane. $#(Choice E)#  For HIV to infect a cell, the envelope glycoprotein gp120 must bind to both a CD4 molecule and a chemokine receptor (eg, CXCR4 or CCR5).  CCR5 antagonists, such as maraviroc, exert their antiviral activity against HIV by blocking attachment and entry of CCR5-tropic viruses into CD4+ T cells and macrophages. $#Educational objective# Integration of double-stranded HIV DNA into the host cell's chromosomes is necessary to induce viral gene expression and prevent degradation of the viral genome.  Raltegravir is an integrase inhibitor that disrupts HIV genome integration, preventing synthesis of viral mRNA.  "

  "explanation_2": "$HIV binds to host cells using the host CD4 receptor and a chemokine coreceptor (either CCR5 or CXCR4).  The virus preferentially targets T lymphocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages because these cells contain high surface concentrations of CD4.  However, each of these cell types contains different surface concentrations of the 2 chemokine receptors.  HIV is considered #tropic# for a certain cell type, depending on whether it preferentially binds to CCR5 or CXCR4 for viral entry, as follows: $• #R5 virus# uses CCR5 for viral entry and is considered #macrophage-tropic# because CCR5 is expressed in high concentrations on both macrophages and lymphocytes.  R5 is the predominant HIV type. $• #X4 virus# uses CXCR4 for viral entry and is considered #T lymphotropic# because CXCR4 is expressed primarily on T lymphocytes but only #minimally on macrophages#. $HIV trophism is determined by a gene sequence in the variable (V3) region of the #env gene#, which encodes for the HIV surface glycoprotein 120.  This glycoprotein mediates viral attachment to the CD4 receptor and chemokine coreceptor. $The laboratory results in this case indicate an X4 virus (T lymphotropic with minimal macrophage invasion).  Patients with X4 virus cannot be treated with HIV medications that target CCR5 (eg, #maraviroc#) because the X4 virus uses CXCR4, not CCR5, to enter cells. $#(Choice A)#  Protease inhibitors (eg, atazanavir, indinavir, darunavir) inhibit HIV protease from cleaving HIV polyproteins into the individual, functional proteins that compose the virus.  This results in the formation of immature, noninfectious virions that are unable to infect T cells or macrophages. $#(Choices B and F)#  Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (eg, efavirenz, nevirapine) allosterically bind reverse transcriptase, which alters its shape and prevents it from converting the HIV RNA genome into complementary DNA (cDNA).  Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (eg, tenofovir, emtricitabine) competitively bind reverse transcriptase and are integrated into growing cDNA strands, which results in chain termination.  Both of these HIV medication classes truncate viral replication but do not affect viral attachment or fusion. $#(Choice C)#  Enfuvirtide is an HIV fusion inhibitor that binds to the HIV transmembrane surface protein glycoprotein 41 and prevents the virus from fusing with the host cell membrane.  Fusion inhibitors would inhibit the ability of HIV to invade both lymphocytes and macrophages. $#(Choice E)#  Integrase inhibitors (eg, raltegravir, dolutegravir) prevent the HIV enzyme integrase from incorporating viral cDNA into the host chromosome, which prevents viral replication.

Neuraminidase is required for the #release# of virus from infected cells and for the spread of virus within the respiratory tract.  Neuraminidase inhibitors cause the newly synthesized virions to adhere to the host cell surface and form viral aggregates, thereby reducing the spread of virus to other host cells.  Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) can shorten the course and complications of influenza A and B infections if taken within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms.  In addition, oseltamivir works to slow viral penetration of the mucous secretions that protect the respiratory epithelium.  Oseltamivir can therefore be used to treat or prevent influenza. $#(Choice A)#  The influenza viral genome consists of segmented RNA, which is translated predominantly into individual proteins rather than a large polyprotein product.  HIV protease inhibitors (eg, darunavir) are used to counteract HIV polyprotein cleavage mediated by viral protease. $#(Choice B)#  Foreign (viral) protein synthesis can be inhibited by α- and β-interferons, which induce the synthesis of proteins that have an antiviral effect.

Mutations to the enzyme that produces beta-D-glucan can lead to echinocandin resistance. $#(Choice E)#  The hyphal form is required for Candida to be pathogenic, and Candida with and without the hyphal form is typically seen in tissue cultures during infection.  However, mutations to the gene that triggers the hyphal form would not alter sensitivity to azole antifungal medications. $#Educational objective# Azole antifungal medications (eg, fluconazole) block the fungal enzyme lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase, a cytochrome p-450–dependent enzyme that converts lanosterol to ergosterol.  Mutations to the gene for 14-alpha-demethylase can lead to azole resistance.  "

Mycolic acids form long branched-chain fatty acids in the outer portion of the mycobacterial peptidoglycan cell wall; they are essential for proper #cell wall# structure and virulence factor synthesis (eg, sulfatides, wax D, cord factor).  When mycobacteria are unable to synthesize mycolic acids, they lose the fidelity of the cell wall and are unable to divide to form new cells. $Mycolic acids in the cell wall are what cause mycobacteria to be #acid-fast#.  This property is due to the retention of a stain (eg, carbolfuchsin dye) despite exposure to an acid-alcohol decolorizing agent.  If the quantity of mycolic acids in the cell wall is reduced (eg, following exposure to isoniazid), the organism will lose the color of the stain when exposed to an acid-alcohol agent. $#(Choice A)#  Fluoroquinolones (eg, ciprofloxacin) can be used as part of a multi-drug regimen to treat some forms of drug resistant tuberculosis.  They inhibit DNA gyrase, leading to fractures in the bacterial chromosome and an inability to code for proteins necessary for survival.  Fluoroquinolones would not have a direct effect on the acid-fastness of mycobacteria. $#(Choice C)#  Rifampin is an essential component of the multi-drug regimen used to treat active tuberculosis.  Rifampin halts bacterial protein synthesis by inhibiting bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, thereby preventing DNA transcription into mRNA.  Rifampin would inhibit mycobacterial growth in an in vitro culture, but it would not cause the mycobacteria to lose their acid-fastness. $#(Choice D)#  Streptomycin is an aminoglycoside that inhibits the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit, thereby halting protein synthesis.  This restricts mycobacterial cell growth and leads to cell death.  However, the acid-fastness of the organism is not affected.  Streptomycin is also indicated in the treatment of plague (caused by Yersinia pestis) and tularemia (caused by Francisella tularensis). $#(Choice E)#  Vancomycin binds to D-alanyl-D-alanine residues, inhibiting polymerization and cross-linking of the glycopeptides forming the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria (not mycobacteria). $#Educational objective# Isoniazid is an antimycobacterial agent that specifically inhibits the synthesis of mycolic acids, which are essential components of the mycobacterial peptidoglycan cell wall.

Most antibiotic-modifying enzymes arise via transfer of plasmids or transposons rather than chromosomal mutations. $#(Choices A, D, and E)#  Cephalosporins (eg, ceftazidime), carbapenems (eg, imipenem), and penicillins (eg, piperacillin) are beta-lactam drugs that exert their effect by interfering with the cell wall.  Resistance to cephalosporins and penicillins occurs largely because of the bacterial secretion of beta-lactamase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes the beta-lactam ring and inactivates the antibiotic.  Carbapenems are not very susceptible to most beta-lactamases due to additional chemical components surrounding their beta-lactam ring; however, resistance to carbapenems can occur due to carbapenemase, which is primarily seen in Enterobacter species. $#(Choice B)#  Fluoroquinolones (eg, ciprofloxacin) block enzymes (DNA gyrase, topoisomerase) responsible for bacterial DNA synthesis.  Resistance usually occurs due to genetic mutations that prevent drug binding to these enzymes or to the increased expression of antibiotic efflux pumps. $#Educational objective# Aminoglycoside (eg, gentamicin) resistance is most commonly due to antibiotic-modifying enzymes.  These enzymes add chemical groups to the antibiotic, which diminishes its ability to bind to the 16S ribosomal RNA within the 30s ribosomal subunit.  "

It may also act as a direct toxin on renal epithelial cells, leading to acute tubular necrosis, renal tubular acidosis, and electrolyte disturbances.  #Severe hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia# (likely reflecting increased distal tubular membrane permeability) can occur, with most patients requiring supplementation.  Renal injury may also lead to decreased erythropoietin production and produce a normochromic normocytic anemia. $Patients with mucormycosis who respond to initial amphotericin therapy may be switched to posaconazole.

  "explanation_2": "This patient has had a relapse of acute prostatitis despite an adequate initial response and good medication adherence.  This treatment failure is likely due to a #drug-drug interaction# with his home medications. $#Fluoroquinolones# normally have very high bioavailability and near-complete absorption.  However, they can form insoluble chelate complexes with #polyvalent cations# (eg, #calcium#, iron, aluminum, magnesium) in the gastrointestinal tract.  This leads to #impaired absorption# and a significant decrease in drug bioavailability.  In this patient's case, his initial response to the antibiotic reflects the parenteral dosing, which bypasses the gastrointestinal tract and avoids this potential interaction. $Over-the-counter #antacids #typically contain calcium, magnesium, and/or aluminum salts and are used by many patients for treatment of heartburn due to gastroesophageal reflux.  Calcium salts (eg, calcium carbonate, calcium citrate) are also widely used in the treatment of osteoporosis.  However, since these medications are available without a prescription and are often taken intermittently, the potential for interaction may not be apparent at the time antibiotic treatment is initiated. $#(Choice A)#  Antimicrobial sensitivity testing of this patient's initial culture showed no significant fluoroquinolone resistance.  In addition, he had a positive initial clinical response.  Loss of effectiveness after changing to an oral formulation is more consistent with decreased bioavailability rather than antibiotic resistance. $#(Choice C)#  Prostatitis due to sexually transmitted organisms is typically seen with Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis and is more common with younger rather than older men.  Reinfection with E coli via sexual contact is unlikely. $#(Choice D)#  Ciprofloxacin is primarily cleared by renal excretion, and the dosage may need to be decreased in patients with significant renal impairment.  However, switching this patient from parenteral to oral antibiotic therapy would not affect renal drug clearance. $#(Choice E)#  Diltiazem is a cytochrome P450 (CYP3A4) inhibitor (not inducer) that can cause increased systemic levels of numerous drugs, leading to drug toxicity (eg, myopathy due to statins).  Regardless, ciprofloxacin is primarily eliminated by renal excretion, and drug levels are unlikely to be significantly affected by P450 inducers. $#Educational objective# Fluoroquinolones can form insoluble chelate complexes with polyvalent cations (eg, calcium, iron, aluminum, magnesium) in the gastrointestinal tract, leading to impaired absorption.

This agent is most likely #acyclovir#, a guanosine analog.  Once acyclovir enters the HSV-infected host cell, it is #phosphorylated# to acyclovir monophosphate, principally via a #viral-encoded thymidine kinase#.

As a result, EBV- or CMV-infected cells cannot easily convert acyclovir into its pharmacologically active form.  At very high intracellular concentrations of acyclovir, a small amount of the drug is activated by unidentified cellular phosphorylating enzymes, which may explain the partial susceptibility of EBV and CMV to high acyclovir doses. $#(Choices A, B, and E)#  Mutations in viral DNA polymerase can lead to acyclovir resistance, but differences in thymidine kinase are the best explanation for the observed results.  Drug degradation rate and viral protease activity are not responsible for differences in viral susceptibility to acyclovir. $#(Choice D)#  Thymidine kinase is an enzyme produced in infected cells, but it is not present in the viral capsid. $#Educational objective# Monophosphorylation of acyclovir by a viral thymidine kinase is the first (and rate-limiting) step in conversion of acyclovir to its active triphosphate form.

  "explanation_2": "$The 2 major factors influencing the effectiveness of antimicrobial agents are the drug concentration at the target site and the amount of time that microbes are exposed to the drug.  The relative contribution of these factors to drug efficacy depends on the particular agent.  In general, antibiotics can be classified into 2 categories based on which factor is more important: $• #Concentration-dependent killing:# Antibiotics with this pattern of activity (eg, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones) have a persistent, suppressive effect on bacterial growth following a limited exposure, resulting in increased killing ability when drug levels at the site of infection are maximized.  The #higher the peak drug level# compared to the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), the #greater the antimicrobial activity#.  As such, higher-dose, #extended-interval# (ie, once-daily) regimens are frequently used to optimize bacterial killing. $• #Time-dependent killing:# Antibiotics with this activity pattern (eg, beta-lactams [penicillins, cephalosporins], clindamycin) have minimal persistent effects and are dependent on #long exposure durations# for their antimicrobial activity.  They are more effective when serum concentrations #exceed the MIC# for a prolonged period.  Therefore, more frequent, #multiple-daily dosing# regimens are used to maintain plasma concentrations greater than the MIC for as long as possible. $#(Choice B)#  The therapeutic index (ie, [toxic dose]/[effective dose]) is a measurement of the relative safety of a drug; it is an intrinsic property upon which drug dosing regimens are devised.  A relatively high therapeutic index is usually necessary to prevent toxicity with extended-interval dosing because the administered drug amounts lead to higher serum levels than seen with more frequent dosing regimens. $#(Choice C)#  Most drugs exhibit a sigmoid-shaped @dose response curve@ that shows no effect until a threshold concentration is exceeded.  After this occurs, the effects increase with increasing drug concentration until a saturation threshold (ie, maximum effect) is reached.  In contrast to this sigmoidal response, the risk of cancer following exposure to ionizing radiation shows a linear dose–response relationship (ie, risk increases proportionately with increased exposure). $#(Choice D)#  The threshold dose is the lowest dose at which drug effects are first seen.  In this case, both dosing regimens cause serum concentrations to rise above the MIC.  Furthermore, the extended-interval dosing regimen results in less total time above the MIC but still demonstrates effectiveness.  Therefore, a low dosing threshold does not explain the effectiveness of extended-interval dosing. $#(Choice E)#  In this example, both treatment regimens were effective, with extended-interval dosing having a slightly better response time.  Because serum concentrations with the extended-interval regimen remain above the MIC for a much shorter period of time compared to multiple-daily dosing, time-dependent killing does not contribute significantly to overall drug efficacy. $#Educational objective# Antibiotics exhibiting concentration-dependent killing can be administered using relatively high doses given at lower frequency.  This allows for effective microbial killing while preventing adverse effects that may occur with prolonged systemic exposure.  ",

  "explanation_2": "This patient's travel history, chronic intestinal symptoms, eosinophilia, and biopsy findings suggest #schistosomiasis#, a parasitic blood fluke infection primarily seen in rural parts of #sub-Saharan Africa# and East Asia.  Exposure occurs when humans swim or bathe in freshwater that contains #contaminated snails# (the intermediate host).  Cercariae from the snails penetrate human skin and migrate to the #liver#, where they mature into adult worms.  Adult worms then travel through the portal circulation to the #mesenteric# venules (S mansoni and S japonicum) or the venous plexus of the #bladder# (S haematobium). $Adult worms release eggs through host tissue to be excreted in feces or urine.  Although most patients are asymptomatic, eggs can trigger a significant #granulomatous inflammatory response#, leading to manifestations in the #gastrointestinal tract# (eg, diarrhea, weight loss, anorexia, anemia), bladder (eg, terminal hematuria), or periportal system (eg, portal hypertension, splenomegaly).  #Eosinophilia# is common early in the disease course as eosinophils release granules that are toxic to adult worms. $Diagnostic confirmation requires the identification of #round/oval eggs# with a characteristic terminal (S. haematobium) or lateral (S. mansoni) @spine@ on stool/urinary testing or tissue biopsy.

Ciprofloxacin is sometimes used for treatment.  However, most cases are brief in duration, eosinophilia is not generally seen, and eggs would not be present. $#(Choice C)#  Ganciclovir can treat @cytomegalovirus colitis@, which frequently causes diarrhea and abdominal pain.

Adult worms mature in the liver, lodge in the mesenteric venules or vesicular venous plexus, and secrete eggs into feces or urine.  Eggs can trigger granulomatous inflammation, leading to symptoms in the gastrointestinal, urinary, or periportal tract.

This enzyme grows DNA by adding nucleotides to the terminal 3′-hydroxyl group using a 3′-5′ #phosphodiester bond#.  #Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors# (NRTIs) such as zidovudine block this step in viral replication.  This class of medications is composed of nucleoside/nucleotide analogues that #do not have a 3′-hydroxyl group#.  When reverse transcriptase incorporates an NRTI into a growing DNA strand, it results in chain termination because no 3′-hydroxyl group is available to add additional base pairs. $Zidovudine (ZDV) was the first approved HIV medication but is now used primarily to prevent maternal to fetal transmission of HIV during labor and delivery.  It is a thymidine analogue that contains an azido group in place of the hydroxyl group usually found at the 3′ end of thymidine. $#(Choice A)#  The enzyme thymidylate synthase catalyzes the conversion of deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) to deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP).  N5, N10-methylene tetrahydrofolate is the methyl donor in this reaction and is converted to dihydrofolate (DHF) in the process.  Tetrahydrofolate is then regenerated from DHF by dihydrofolate reductase.  Methotrexate is a chemotherapeutic agent that inhibits DNA synthesis by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase. $#(Choice B)#  Integration of viral DNA into the host genome is mediated by integrase, an HIV enzyme that is inhibited by integrase strand transfer inhibitors (eg, raltegravir). $#(Choice C)#  Inhibition of nucleoside phosphorylation is not an effect of ZDV.  In fact, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (including ZDV) must be phosphorylated within the host cell to form the functional triphosphate moiety.  Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors can bind directly to (and inactivate) reverse transcriptase without being phosphorylated. $#(Choice E)#  In double-stranded DNA, A always pairs with T, and G always pairs with C.  These bases bind via hydrogen bonds.  Some chemotherapeutic agents, such as the anthracyclines daunorubicin and doxorubicin, intercalate between the bases, causing defective base pairing and splitting of the DNA strands.  Transcription and replication failure and mutagenesis ultimately result. $#Educational objective# Zidovudine (ZDV) is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor used to prevent maternal to fetal transmission of HIV during labor (when the mother is not virally suppressed).  It is a thymidine analogue that does not have the normal 3′-hydroxyl group found on thymidine.  Because new nucleotides are added to growing DNA chains only at the 3′-hydroxyl group, the addition of ZDV into DNA results in chain termination.  "

Pertussis is caused by the gram-negative bacterium Bordetella pertussis and spreads via respiratory droplets.  The greatest risk factor is lack of immunization, and older children/adults with mild disease are often the source of infection. $Pertussis is a #prolonged illness# that typically progresses through 3 stages:  catarrhal (mild rhinorrhea or cough), paroxysmal (bouts of severe cough), and convalescent (weeks to months of gradual resolution).  Infants are at high risk of complications (eg, cyanosis, apnea, seizure), particularly during the paroxysmal stage.  Diagnostic clues include #lack of fever#, as well as cough associated with #turning red in the face#, an inspiratory whoop, or posttussive emesis.  #Lymphocytosis#, the degree of which correlates with disease severity, is also a characteristic finding and related to impaired leukocyte chemotaxis caused by pertussis toxin. $Pertussis is usually a clinical diagnosis and should be treated empirically with a #macrolide# antibiotic (eg, azithromycin).

Patients often have fever and rash. $#(Choice B)#  Syphilis is universally susceptible to penicillin.  In addition, secondary syphilis (eg, widespread maculopapular rash, constitutional symptoms, lymphadenopathy) develops weeks or months after the chancre of primary syphilis; therefore, disease progression is unlikely in this case. $#(Choice D)#  Penicillin allergy is due to immune sensitization following previous exposure.  Additional exposure triggers an IgE-mediated (type I) allergic response; symptoms often include rash, bronchospasm, angioedema, flushing, hypotension, and/or pruritis.  Fever, chills, headache, and myalgias would be atypical and are more consistent with the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. $#(Choice E)#  Intramuscular benzathine penicillin G is a long-acting drug that is excreted in the urine.  Poor renal tubular secretion could increase plasma drug concentrations but would be unlikely to induce a systemic inflammatory response. $#Educational objective# The Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction is an acute inflammatory reaction that occurs within hours of treatment for spirochetal infections (eg, syphilis).  The rapid lysis of spirochetes releases inflammatory bacterial lipoproteins into the circulation and causes acute fever, rigors, and myalgias.  "

  "explanation_2": "$This patient with enterococcal endocarditis likely received an #aminoglycoside# (AG) such as gentamicin, a ribosome-targeting antibiotic.  AGs are associated with #ototoxicity# (hearing loss, tinnitus) and #nephrotoxicity#. $mRNA is translated into amino acids (AAs) and proteins on ribosomes. $• The small ribosomal subunit (30S in prokaryotes, 40S in eukaryotes) binds mRNA, which contains genetic information serving as a reading frame, and tRNA, which serves as an AA carrier $• The larger ribosomal subunit (50S in prokaryotes, 60S in eukaryotes) contains peptidyltransferase, which catalyzes peptide bond formation between AAs $In #prokaryotes#, a unique mRNA sequence (Shine-Dalgarno) is located upstream from initiation codon AUG, which recognizes an N-formylmethionine-tRNA.  This sequence allows 30S binding to mRNA and this N-formylmethionine-tRNA (forming the prokaryotic 30S #initiation complex#).  The energy for this reaction (GTP hydrolysis) brings the 50S subunit into the initiation complex, resulting in a 70S ribosomal unit. $AGs irreversibly bind to #bacterial 30S# but not eukaryotic 40S; this causes #genetic code misreading# and bacterial protein synthesis inhibition.  AGs also appear to impact #translocation#, whereby an aminoacyl-tRNA is shifted from the ribosomal A site (after initial binding) to the P site (after AA incorporation into the peptide chain during elongation) to the E site (after AA cleaving from its tRNA).  The initial N-formylmethionine-tRNA notably binds at the P site. $#(Choice A)#  AGs need to diffuse inside the cell to reach the ribosome.  As a result, they are often prescribed #synergistically# in combination with antibiotics affecting cell wall synthesis.  These include penicillins, which impact cell wall cross-linking, or vancomycin.  Vancomycin is also associated with ototoxicity, but it is a glycopeptide antibiotic that acts by #directly# inhibiting peptidoglycan synthesis, #not# cell wall cross-linking (which occurs at a later stage of cell wall synthesis).  Although Enterococcus is generally resistant to AGs, these drugs are routinely used as synergistic agents# in combination# with penicillins or vancomycin in patients with enterococcal endocarditis; such combinations lead to improved bacterial killing and are the standard of care for this condition. $#(Choices B and C)#  Fluoroquinolones act on DNA gyrase to prevent DNA unwinding.  Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole affects folic acid synthesis.  These antibiotics are not classically associated with ototoxicity and are not used synergistically for enterococcal endocarditis. $#(Choice D)#  Daptomycin disrupts the bacterial membrane by creating transmembrane channels that cause intracellular ion leakage and cellular membrane depolarization.  Its main side effects are myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. $#(Choice F)#  tRNA charging refers to initial covalent bonding between tRNA and the corresponding AA, facilitated by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase; inhibitors of this enzyme are potential antibiotics. $#Educational objective# Aminoglycosides inhibit genetic code reading and protein synthesis by binding to the prokaryotic 30S ribosomal subunit."

Initial infection is generally asymptomatic, with subsequent manifestations depending on cyst location and size.  The #liver# is often affected (leading to hepatomegaly or right upper quadrant pain), but other organs such as the lungs or muscles can be involved.  Unilocular lesions are typical of E granulosus, and multilocular lesions are typical of E multilocularis. $When infection occurs, echinococcal larvae implant within the capillaries, triggering an inflammatory reaction involving monocytes and eosinophils.  Some larvae encyst.  Microscopic examination demonstrates an encapsulated and calcified cyst (\"#eggshell calcification#\") containing fluid and budding cells that will eventually become daughter cysts.  The outer wall is composed of gelatinous sheets surrounded by a thick fibrous capsule.  Imaging (ultrasound, CT, MRI) and serology testing can be used for diagnosis. $Depending on the size of the cyst, surgery and adjunctive chemotherapy (eg, albendazole) are the treatment of choice for symptomatic patients.

Hypovolemia is typically caused by severe blood loss, although excessive loss of other bodily fluids (eg, diarrhea, vomiting, burns, dehydration) may also be responsible.  Pulmonary emboli are typically caused by the propagation of venous thrombi, with less common sources including air bubbles, fat droplets, amniotic fluid, or clumps of parasites or malignant cells.  Overwhelming systemic infection with bacterial organisms can cause septic shock (hypotension, low blood flow).  None of these conditions is typically associated with hydatid cysts. $#Educational objective# Echinococcus granulosus is the most common cause of hydatid cysts.  Spilling of cyst contents can cause anaphylactic shock.  Surgical manipulation should be performed with caution.  "

When the host produces antibodies against gonococcal pili, mucosal adherence is inhibited.  At a given time, only 1 pilus gene is functional, so only 1 pilus type is expressed.  However, the structural genes for pilus proteins undergo #antigenic variation# at a high frequency; they undergo #recombination# with each other to produce new antigenic types of pili.  The number of possible antigenic pilus types is theoretically quite large.  This diversity is a reason that vaccine development against N gonorrhoeae pili has been challenging. $#(Choice A)#  Antigenic mimicry is the sharing of antigenic sequences between the microorganism and the host cell, facilitating immune evasion.  The gonococcal lipooligosaccharide is similar in structure to human cell membrane glycosphingolipids.  However, this is not related to antibody formation against the pilus.  Antigenic mimicry can lead to autoimmune disease if the host mounts an immune response against the infectious epitope and that epitope has sufficient sequence homology with a host antigen. $#(Choice C)#  Plasmid conjugation plays an important role in gonococcal antibiotic resistance. $#(Choice D)#  Pilin proteins do not represent a low molecular weight structure that would be poorly immunogenic. $#(Choice E)#  Gonococcal pili are protein polymers.

Infants born to HBeAg-positive women (as in this case) have a >90% chance of acquiring infection, whereas the chance is less in infants born to HBeAg-negative women. $Viral replication occurs rapidly in infected infants due to immune system immaturity in newborns.

As a result, laboratory markers of liver injury (eg, liver function tests, direct bilirubinemia) are usually normal or only mildly elevated in HBV-infected neonates. $#(Choice E)#  Perinatally infected infants have rapid appearance of HBsAg within a few days; absence of both HBsAg and anti-HBs at age 2 months would suggest that the infant was not infected.  However, this is unlikely as virtually all infants born to HBeAg-positive mothers will be infected perinatally. $#Educational objective# Infants born to HBeAg-positive mothers have a high risk of acquiring perinatal hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.

It is then cleaved into the envelope proteins #gp120#, which mediates viral attachment, and #gp41#, which mediates viral fusion with the host cell.

These enzymes are not glycosylated. $#(Choice E)#  Uninfected CD4 cells can undergo activation-induced apoptosis when responding to HIV peptides displayed on the surface of infected cells.  CD4 cells infected with HIV are damaged primarily through direct cytopathic effects.  Both mechanisms contribute to CD4 cell depletion in HIV infection. $#Educational objective# In the HIV replication cycle, polyprotein precursors are encoded by the structural genes gag, pol, and env.  Only the env gene polyprotein product (gp160) is glycosylated.  This polyprotein is subsequently cleaved in the Golgi apparatus to form the envelope glycoproteins gp120 and gp41.  "

The first is a decrease in bacterial expression of the catalase-peroxidase enzyme that is required for isoniazid activation once the drug enters the bacterial cell.  The second mechanism of resistance occurs through modification of the protein target binding site for isoniazid.  Treatment of active tuberculosis is accomplished by combining multiple antibiotics to avoid selecting for resistant strains.

This happens in the majority of exposures.  By the time tuberculosis has progressed to active, symptomatic disease, large caseous and liquefactive necrotic granulomas have usually formed and a lengthy treatment period with appropriate multidrug therapy is required to eradicate the organism.

For instance, #MacConkey agar# is selective for #gram-negative rods# because gram-positive bacteria are unable to grow on this culture medium.  Some gram-negative rods can #ferment lactose#, causing colonies to turn pink, and both Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae are fast lactose fermenters.  The ability to convert tryptophan to indole (ie, #indole-positive#) can further differentiate bacteria, and the indole-positivity of E coli distinguishes it from E cloacae #(choice A).# $Among the organisms listed, this patient with lactose-fermenting, indole-positive bacterial growth on MacConkey agar has infection due to #E coli#, the most common cause of UTI.  Women are more likely than men to develop UTIs due to a shorter distance between the anus and urethra, and fecal incontinence increases the risk of introducing gastrointestinal flora such as E coli into the urinary tract.  Other predisposing factors for E coli UTI—particularly in older women—include diabetes, urinary retention or incontinence, and instrumentation of the urethra (eg, intermittent catheterization), all of which are present in this patient. $#(Choices C and D)#  Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are gram-negative rods that can cause UTI, most commonly in patients with indwelling Foley catheters.  However, in contrast to E coli, these organisms are lactose nonfermenters (ie, do not form pink colonies on MacConkey agar). $#(Choice E)#  Staphylococcus saprophyticus is the second-most frequent cause of UTI after E coli in young, sexually active women but is less common in the elderly population.  Moreover, staphylococci are gram-positive, and therefore would not grow on MacConkey agar. $#Educational objective# Escherichia coli are lactose-fermenting, indole-positive, gram-negative rods that grow on MacConkey agar and are the most common pathogen causing urinary tract infection.

It is characterized by the triad of renal insufficiency, thrombocytopenia, and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia.  Most cases occur due to underlying #enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli# (EHEC) infection, particularly with the O157:H7 serotype. $EHEC is a gram-negative, enteric rod that acquires the ability to produce #Shiga toxin# from a lysogenic bacteriophage.  Shiga toxin enters the cytosol of host cells and cleaves a protein motif off the 60S ribosomal subunit, which irreversibly halts host protein synthesis and causes cell death.  Toxin-mediated injury to the colonic mucosa and the colonic capillaries causes abdominal pain and #bloody diarrhea#.  The absorption of Shiga toxin into the systemic circulation causes glomerular (renal insufficiency) and vascular (thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia) injury in a minority of patients, leading to HUS. $The primary reservoir for EHEC is the gastrointestinal tract of healthy cattle.  Humans primarily acquire the organism after consuming contaminated, #undercooked beef#.  Because low infectious doses (10-100 organisms) are required for disease, meatpacking facilities that process high volumes of ground beef are an important source of outbreaks.  Other less common routes of transmission include person-to-person contact and fruits and vegetables contaminated with manure. $#(Choice A)#  Canned foods that are contaminated with Clostridium botulinum can be associated with foodborne illness due to the consumption of preformed botulism toxin.  Patients typically develop descending, symmetric paralysis. $#(Choices B and D)#  The consumption of preformed, heat-stable Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin causes self-limited nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramping 1-6 hours after ingestion.  Dairy (eg, custard), produce, meats, eggs (eg, mayonnaise), and salads are common culprits and are usually inoculated during preparation by a food handler. $#(Choice C)#  Bacillus cereus enterotoxin is classically associated with reheated rice.  It causes a vomiting-predominant, foodborne illness that clinically resembles the illness seen with S aureus enterotoxin. $#(Choice E)#  Consumption of raw oysters can lead to infection with Vibrio parahaemolyticus (which causes voluminous watery diarrhea similar to cholera) and Vibrio vulnificus (which causes sepsis with high mortality), as well as other Vibrio infections. $#(Choice F)#  The consumption of raw eggs or incompletely cooked poultry can lead to Salmonella gastroenteritis, which usually causes watery diarrhea, abdominal cramping, vomiting, and fever. $#Educational objective# Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) is primarily contracted after eating undercooked ground beef.  EHEC produces Shiga toxin, which causes hemorrhagic colitis and can lead to hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS).

The genitourinary tract (eg, cystoscopy) is the most common portal of entry; gastrointestinal (eg, colonoscopy) or obstetric procedures are also risk factors.  Enterococci can also cause urinary tract infections (most common), intraabdominal and pelvic infections, and wound infections.  Enterococci are typically gamma-hemolytic (no hemolysis on agar), #catalase-negative#, pyrrolidonyl arylamidase-positive, Lancefield Group D #gram-positive cocci# that can grow in #hypertonic (6.5%) saline and bile#.  The most common species of enterococci (formerly classified under the genus Streptococcus) are Enterococcus faecalis (80%-90%) and Enterococcus faecium (10%-15%). $Enterococci are resistant to many antibiotics and can be very difficult to treat.  A cell wall-active agent (such as ampicillin) is often combined with an aminoglycoside for synergistic effect, but increasingly bacteria resistant to both aminoglycosides and β-lactams (including penicillinase-resistant types) are emerging.  Strains with vancomycin or linezolid resistance have also appeared. $#(Choice B)#  Dental extraction is associated with endocarditis caused by viridans group streptococci (VGS).  In most cases, VGS cause subacute bacterial endocarditis in already abnormal heart valves (eg, congenital valvular abnormalities, valves damaged by rheumatic fever).  VGS do not grow on hypertonic saline.  In addition, almost all VGS species do not grow on bile (VGS are also considered bile-insoluble as they exhibit no cell lysis in the presence of bile, in contrast to the bile-soluble S pneumoniae). $#(Choice C)#  Removal of a nasal polyp can cause transient bacteremia.  Organisms that colonize the nose include Corynebacterium species, Haemophilus species, staphylococci, streptococci, and Neisseria species.  Of these, staphylococci and streptococci may cause endocarditis, but the organism described displays characteristics of Enterococcus. $#(Choice D)#  Sinus infections are usually caused by S pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis.  S pneumoniae would be a very rare cause of endocarditis and is usually identified by being bile-soluble and optochin-sensitive. $#(Choice E)#  Skin biopsy is a benign procedure that would be unlikely to cause endocarditis.  Skin is colonized with many bacteria, including Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species, Corynebacterium species, and Bacillus species. $#Educational objective# Enterococcus is a component of the normal colonic and urogenital flora and is capable of growing in hypertonic saline and bile.

  "explanation_2": "#Leptospirosis# is a widespread, zoonotic infection caused by several species of Leptospira, a thin, highly coiled, #motile spirochete# that infects wild (eg, rodents) and domestic (eg, dogs, cattle) animals.  Infected animals harbor the organism in the proximal renal tubule and excrete it in urine.  Transmission to humans primarily occurs during outdoor recreational (eg, kayaking, freshwater swimming) or occupational activities that exposes them to #water contaminated with animal urine#. $Most cases of leptospirosis are mild or subclinical.  However, some patients develop a #flu-like illness# (eg, fever, rigors, myalgia, headache), lymphadenopathy, or more severe end-organ disease such as renal failure or hepatic failure (eg, jaundice, hepatomegaly).  #Conjunctival suffusion#, redness of the conjunctiva that resembles conjunctivitis but is noninflammatory, is an important diagnostic clue.  Because spirochetes do not grow well on traditional culture media, initial blood cultures are often negative.  However, specialized culture media can often identify the #corkscrew-shaped organism#. $#(Choice A)#  Bats can transmit rabies to humans via a bite wound.  Manifestations typically begin with flulike symptoms and progress to fever, hydrophobia, pharyngeal spasms, coma, and death.  Rabies is a cylindrical, enveloped RNA virus; it is not a motile, corkscrew-shaped organism. $#(Choice B)#  Yersinia, a bacteria transmitted by animal (eg, rodent) fleas, can cause bubonic plague, which typically presents with sudden-onset, flulike symptoms followed by intense pain and regional lymphadenopathy (eg, inguinal).  Yersinia grows well on traditional culture media; it appears on Gram stain as a gram-negative coccobacillus. $#(Choice D)#  Lyme disease is a spirochetal, tick-borne illness that can cause chronic arthritis and neurologic manifestations (eg, meningitis, neuropathy); prominent hepatic dysfunction (eg, jaundice) and acute renal failure would not be expected.  Rocky Mountain spotted fever is another tickborne illness that can present with flulike symptoms and conjunctivitis, however, it is caused by the gram-negative bacterium Rickettsia rickettsii (not a corkscrew-shaped spirochete). $#(Choice E)#  Tularemia is caused by the gram-negative bacterium Francisella tularensis, which frequently infects rabbits.  Manifestations typically include flulike symptoms followed by lymphadenopathy and a papulo-ulcerative eschar at the site of inoculation. $#Educational objective# Leptospirosis is a zoonotic infection caused by the motile spirochete Leptospira.  Transmission primarily occurs when humans come into contact with water contaminated with animal urine during outdoor recreational or occupational activities.

  "explanation_2": "This patient has #necrotizing fasciitis# (\"flesh-eating disease\"), a severe soft tissue infection characterized by fulminant tissue necrosis and high mortality.  The condition is often polymicrobial, but monomicrobial infection can occur with #Streptococcus pyogenes#, Staphylococcus aureus, and Clostridium perfringens.  @S pyogenes@ (group A Streptococcus) is a gram-positive cocci that is coagulase negative, catalase negative, and pyrrolidonyl arylamidase (#PYR#) #positive#.  It also forms small colonies with a wide zone of beta-hemolysis and is sensitive to bacitracin, which has been widely replaced by the PYR test. $S pyogenes can be transmitted through wounds and spreads rapidly to the deep layers of the skin and fascia due to production of #hyaluronidase# and #streptokinase# (converts plasminogen to plasmin).  M protein is expressed on the surface and allows the bacteria to evade phagocytosis by preventing activation of the alternative complement pathway.  The bacterium also secretes hemolysins O and S (cytotoxins that cause hemolysis) and pyrogenic exotoxins (superantigens that result in tissue injury and septic shock). $Sudden-onset, #severe pain# and swelling are typically present at a site of trauma or recent surgery.  Patients quickly become #hypotensive# and develop septic shock.  Necrotizing fasciitis is treated with #aggressive surgical debridement# of all necrotic tissue plus empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics due to the high incidence of polymicrobial infection. $#(Choice A)#  A hydrophila is an oxidase-positive, non–lactose-fermenting, gram-negative rod.  It can cause gastroenteritis, wound infections, and bacteremia following exposure to contaminated water. $#(Choice B)#  C perfringens is a large, spore-forming, anaerobic, gram-positive rod that is catalase and coagulase negative.  It is implicated in food poisoning, clostridial myonecrosis (gas gangrene), and bacteremia.  On blood agar, it produces a double zone of beta-hemolysis. $#(Choice C)#  S aureus is a gram-positive coccus that grows in clusters.  It is catalase positive, coagulase positive, and PYR negative.  S aureus produces large colonies and demonstrates beta-hemolysis.  Like S pyogenes, S aureus can also cause monomicrobial necrotizing fasciitis. $#(Choice D)#  S agalactiae (group B Streptococcus) is a coagulase- and catalase-negative, PYR negative, gram-positive coccus that grows in chains.  Colonies produce a narrow zone of beta-hemolysis that enhances when plated perpendicular to S aureus (positive CAMP test).  S agalactiae can cause skin and soft tissue infections, as well as newborn sepsis and meningitis. $#Educational objective# Necrotizing fasciitis is a severe infection of the subcutaneous tissue and deep fascia and is a surgical emergency.  The infection is often polymicrobial, but monomicrobial cases due to Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus) can also occur.  S pyogenes is a PYR-positive, beta-hemolytic, gram-positive coccus that grows in chains.  ",

A wide range of pathogens can cause genital ulcers, but a #solitary#, #painless ulcer# with heaped-up borders and a clean base usually indicates #primary syphilis# (syphilitic chancre).  Syphilis is caused by #Treponema pallidum#, a gram-negative spirochete that cannot be cultured and cannot be detected on Gram stain due to its small size. $The diagnosis of syphilis relies primarily on nontreponemal (eg, rapid plasma reagin, VDRL) and treponemal (eg, fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption) serologic testing.  However, because humoral antibody response often takes 4 weeks to develop, #false-negative serologic testing# is common early in the course of disease.  Nontreponemal tests are particularly susceptible to initial false-negative results (as in this patient); treponemal tests are more sensitive in early infection and are often used preferentially in this setting. $Although not widely available, the diagnostic gold standard for syphilis is to directly visualize the organism in tissue scrapings from a cutaneous lesion (eg, chancre).  This can involve fluorescent antibody testing or #dark-field microscopy#, which will show #motile#, #helical spirochetes#. $#(Choice A)#  L serovars of Chlamydia trachomatis cause lymphogranuloma venereum.

This disease is very rare in the United States and occurs mostly in tropical and subtropical regions. $#(Choice B)#  Haemophilus ducreyi is a small gram-negative rod that causes chancroid, a sexually transmitted infection characterized by painful (not painless) genital ulcers with an erythematous base.  Lesions typically begin as papules or pustules and evolve into an ulcer.  More than one lesion is often present. $#(Choice C)#  Herpes simplex virus usually causes multiple, bilateral, painful, ulcerating lesions.

In contrast to gingivostomatitis, recurrent labialis disease is usually mild, unilateral, and limited to the lips due to host immune mechanisms (eg, presence of neutralizing antibody & HSV-specific cytotoxic T cells). $#Educational objective# Herpetic gingivostomatitis is a severe vesicular or ulcerative disease following primary infection with herpes simplex virus type 1.  The diagnosis is supported by the presence of multinucleated giant cells in a Tzanck smear.  Involvement of the gingiva, tongue, palate, and pharynx along with systemic symptoms (eg, fever, malaise) is common.  In contrast, herpes reactivation in the trigeminal ganglia generally results in mild perioral vesicles.  "

  "explanation_2": "This patient recently traveled to South America and now has several manifestations of #dengue#, a Flavivirus infection transmitted by female Aedes mosquitoes.  Although primary (first) infections can be asymptomatic, adult patients may develop high fever, retroorbital pain, and severe myalgia/arthralgia, which gives dengue its common name #breakbone fever#.  Hemorrhagic symptoms (eg, epistaxis, petechiae/purpura) can also occur, and laboratory evaluation often shows leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated transaminases.  Most primary infections #resolve spontaneously# within 3-5 days and lead to lifelong protective immunity against the infecting viral serotype. $However, there are 4 dengue virus serotypes, and #secondary# infection with a #different viral serotype# is common and is usually associated with #more severe illness#.  Secondary infections are particularly likely to cause #dengue shock syndrome#, a life-threatening dysregulation marked by increased capillary permeability, circulatory collapse (eg, shock), and end-organ damage (eg, #stupor#). $Although the exact pathogenesis of dengue shock syndrome remains unclear, it is probably due to the formation of nonneutralizing, #cross-reactive antibodies# during primary infection that then trigger antibody-dependent #enhancement of secondary infection#.  There may also be accelerated (not blunted) T-lymphocyte activity against secondary infection due to display of cross-reacting viral antigens on major histocompatibility complexes of infected cells #(choice B).# $#(Choice A)#  Antigenic drift is a minor change in viral structure that makes neutralizing antibodies formed during previous infection less effective.  This can increase the risk of reinfection and lead to outbreaks.  Antigenic drift is frequently seen with the influenza virus, but is not prominent with the dengue virus. $#(Choice D)#  Dengue virus inoculation size is not strongly correlated with severity of illness compared to many other viral infections (eg, influenza, hepatitis B). $#(Choice E)#  Viral superinfection can occur when hepatitis D virus infects a patient with active hepatitis B virus infection.  Although superinfection can cause severe hepatitis (eg, elevated transaminases, systemic symptoms, high fever), the presence of the shock syndrome and hemorrhagic manifestations shortly after travel to South America makes dengue more likely.  Hepatitis D is uncommon in the western hemisphere unless patients are in a high-risk category (eg, injection drug user). $#Educational objective# There are 4 different serotypes of dengue virus.  Repeat infection occurs when a person is exposed to a serotype not previously encountered.  Secondary infections are often far more severe than primary infections and may be associated with a life-threatening shock syndrome.  "

  "explanation_2": "$This patient's pulmonary/gastrointestinal symptoms, eosinophilia, and larvae on pulmonary sample indicate #strongyloidiasis#, a helminth infection endemic to #Southeast Asia# (eg, Myanmar), #Africa#, and the Western Pacific.  Transmission typically occurs when humans walk barefoot on ground contaminated with human feces. $Filariform larvae in the soil #penetrate the skin#, travel through the bloodstream/lymphatics, and enter the alveoli.  They ascend the tracheobronchial tree and are swallowed.  The larvae mature into adult worms in the gastrointestinal tract, enter the mucosa of the duodenum and jejunum, and secrete noninfectious rhabditiform larvae into stool for excretion.  A few @rhabditiform larvae@ mature into filiform larvae in the gastrointestinal tract and reinfect the host through the intestinal mucosa or perianal skin (autoinoculation). $Many patients are asymptomatic because the host immune system keeps the organism in check; however, symptoms may emerge in the setting of #immunocompromise# due to medications (eg, #glucocorticoid therapy#) or comorbid illness (eg, cancer, HIV).  Common manifestations include the following: $• #Larva currens:#  Larvae migrate through cutaneous tissue near the site of penetration, leaving narrow, reddish-brown streaks. $• #Pulmonary symptoms:#  Larvae passing through the lungs can cause dyspnea, wheezing, and dry cough. $• #Gastrointestinal symptoms:#  Larvae in the gastrointestinal tract can cause diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal pain. $Most patients also have peripheral #eosinophilia#.  The diagnosis is typically made when rhabditiform larvae are identified in the stool or, less commonly, sputum. $#(Choice A)#  Mosquitos can transmit viral (eg, dengue) and parasitic (eg, malaria) infections.  However, these illnesses cause high fever and other systemic symptoms shortly after transmission.  Eosinophilia and a nematode (ie, roundworm) in the sputum are more suggestive of helminth infection. $#(Choice B)#  Borrelia burgdorferi, a spirochete, is transmitted by Ixodes scapularis tick bite.  It causes Lyme disease, which typically presents with a migrating, target-shaped rash that may progress to involve the nervous system or joints.  Gastrointestinal/pulmonary symptoms and eosinophilia indicate an alternate diagnosis. $#(Choice D)#  Ingestion of oocysts is a common mode of transmission for protozoan parasites (eg, Giardia, Cryptosporidium), which often cause diarrhea and crampy abdominal pain.  However, a nematode on sputum microscopy indicates a helminth (ie, parasitic worm) infection; helminths (eg, strongyloidiasis, ascariasis, schistosomiasis) produce eggs (containing multicellular embryos), not oocysts (thick-walled spores). $#(Choice E)#  Inhalation of spores can cause a variety of pulmonary fungal infections (eg, histoplasmosis, aspergillosis).  Although these pathogens can cause peripheral eosinophilia and pulmonary symptoms, helminths would not be seen in sputum samples. $#Educational objective# Strongyloides stercoralis is transmitted in tropical/subtropical climates when human skin comes into direct contact with filariform larvae.  The larvae penetrate the skin, enter the bloodstream, pass through the lungs, and are swallowed into the digestive system.  Common manifestations include linear skin rash and irritative digestive/respiratory symptoms.  ",

First-line treatment (which can be given empirically, particularly if test results are unrevealing) includes a combination of #pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine# (or pyrimethamine and clindamycin in case of sulfa drug hypersensitivity) along with leucovorin (folinic acid). $#(Choice A)#  Amphotericin (with flucytosine) is used to treat cryptococcal meningitis, a well-known cause of meningitis in AIDS patients that typically manifests with nausea, vomiting, nuchal rigidity, and altered mental status.  Ring-enhancing lesions are not commonly seen on imaging as cryptococcomas are rare.  Amphotericin can treat invasive aspergillosis; however, central nervous system aspergillosis more classically presents as an abscess (eg, single ring-enhancing lesion), is often accompanied by pulmonary (eg, cough, dyspnea) and orbital manifestations in patients with HIV, and is primarily treated with voriconazole rather than amphotericin. $#(Choice B)#  Ampicillin is typically used to treat Listeria infection.  L monocytogenes can cause meningitis in immunosuppressed patients but does not typically form ring-enhancing lesions. $#(Choice C)#  Ganciclovir is used in the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection.  CMV primarily causes symptomatic disease (eg, retinitis, esophagitis, pneumonia) in the immunosuppressed.  Characteristic manifestations of central nervous system involvement include polyneuropathy, transverse myelitis, and encephalitis. $#(Choice D)#  In developing countries, mycobacterial infection causes brain tuberculomas (nodular granulomatous lesions), but this would be less likely in the United States.  Tuberculoma treatment typically includes 5 antitubercular drugs rather than only isoniazid and rifampin. $The differential diagnosis for this patient also includes primary central nervous system lymphoma (second most common after cerebral toxoplasmosis), primary brain tumors (eg, glioblastoma multiforme), metastatic carcinoma, and fungal or bacterial abscesses. $#Educational objective# In patients with HIV, the presence of multiple ring-enhancing lesions with mass effect is most often indicative of toxoplasmosis, followed by primary central nervous system lymphoma.

The adult worms remain in these blood vessels for life (5-30 years), adhering to the vessel wall with suckers and releasing eggs into circulation.

  "explanation_2": "$The #50% infectious dose# (ID₅₀) corresponds to the minimum number of organisms required to cause disease in 50% of exposed individuals.  When controlling for the route of exposure and overall health of the host, the ID₅₀ is generally correlated inversely with degree of disease communicability. $The organism in Line 2 (Salmonella) has an ID₅₀ of approximately 107, whereas the organism in Line 1 has a much #lower ID₅₀# #of about 102#.  Of the given options, the organism with the lowest ID₅₀ is #Shigella flexneri#.  Depending on the species, as few as 10 Shigella organisms can cause disease. $The low ID₅₀ of Shigella is related to virulence factors expressed in various locations in the gastrointestinal tract: $• Stomach:  Shigella can #survive a low-pH environment#, the primary reason for its low ID₅₀.  On exposure to acidic conditions, Shigella species upregulate the transcription of #pH-resistant virulence genes#, making them relatively resistant to degradation in the stomach.  This characteristic is in contrast to the acid-sensitivity of Salmonella, which contributes to its higher ID₅₀. $• Proximal small intestine:  Bile salts are normally bactericidal, but exposure to them upregulates production of adhesin proteins and promotes formation of Shigella biofilms. $• Distal small intestine:  Shigella invades cells forming the epithelial barrier and can spread to other cells laterally (ie, cell-to-cell spread) without reentering the gut lumen. $Other organisms that can cause diarrhea with a small inoculum include Campylobacter jejuni (500 organisms), Entamoeba histolytica (1-10), and Giardia lamblia (1-10). $#(Choices A and D)#  Like Salmonella, Clostridium perfringens and Vibrio cholerae are acid sensitive and thrive in more alkaline conditions, requiring a relatively high ID₅₀ (104-108). $#(Choice B)#  Some strains of Escherichia coli that cause gastroenteritis (eg, Shiga toxin–producing E coli) have a low ID₅₀ due to their ability to survive an acidic environment, similar to Shigella.  However, enterotoxigenic E coli is less adaptive to extreme acidity and therefore has a higher ID₅₀. $#(Choice E)#  Yersinia pestis, which causes the plague (eg, fever, buboes), has an extremely low ID₅₀ (<10 organisms) when transmitted via the subcutaneous route (eg, fleas). In contrast, Yersinia enterocolitica (fecal-oral transmission, diarrheal illness) has a higher ID₅₀; although this bacterium produces urease, making it somewhat acid resistant, its growth is improved in more alkaline conditions. $#Educational objective# Shigella species require a low infectious dose to cause gastrointestinal disease.  The mechanism primarily involves their ability to survive in the acidic (low pH) gastric environment.  "

  "explanation_2": "This patient with dysuria and urinary leukocyte esterase and nitrites likely has a #urinary tract infection# (UTI), which is most commonly caused by fecal flora (eg, Escherichia coli).  Females are at increased risk because the urethra is shorter and closer to the anus.  Bacterial growth of a single pathogenic organism on urine culture is typically diagnostic.  However, #urine dipstick# is usually performed initially because it rapidly assesses for UTI pending culture results. $The #most specific# dipstick finding for bacterial UTI is #nitrites#.  Pathophysiology involves production of nitrate reductase by certain bacteria (eg, E coli, Klebsiella, Proteus); this bacterial enzyme reduces normal urinary nitrate (NO3−) to nitrite (NO2−).  The level of nitrites #correlates# with the #incubation time of bacteria# in the bladder. $In patients with UTI caused by nitrate reductase–producing bacteria, dipstick analysis performed on the #first voided urine# in the morning is usually #positive# due to prolonged overnight bacterial incubation (>4 hr), allowing nitrites to accumulate.  In contrast, specimens obtained #during the day# may show #false negative# results, as in this patient's initial sample, because of the shorter duration of urine in the bladder and urinary frequency. $#(Choice A)#  A first-morning void is typically more (not less) concentrated than a sample obtained during the day.  Detection of urinary nitrites is more likely in concentrated than in dilute urine; this is likely related to relatively decreased oral intake of fluids, and therefore urinary frequency as well, leading to a prolonged duration of bacteria in the bladder. $#(Choice B)#  Leukocyte esterase, another common dipstick finding in UTIs, is released by lysed neutrophils/macrophages and is a marker of white blood cell activity and inflammation.  However, nitrite production is not related to white blood cell activity. $#(Choice D)#  Antibiotic-resistant organisms can lead to persistent abnormalities on urine studies despite empiric antibiotic therapy.  However, resistance would not affect bacteria's ability to produce nitrate reductase, and therefore does not explain this patient's new finding of nitrites. $#(Choice E)#  Bacterial contaminants can alter culture results due to the prolonged incubation time of the test.  However, the short duration between urine collection and dipstick analysis is insufficient for nitrite production from contaminants.  Moreover, contaminants that can produce nitrites are typically from the stool, not the skin. $#Educational objective# Nitrites on dipstick are highly specific for urinary tract infections.

Although these infections can occur in both immunocompetent and immunosuppressed hosts, most cases arise in patients with untreated AIDS who have #CD4 counts <50/mm3#. $MAC organisms are acquired by ingestion or inhalation.  They are phagocytosed by macrophages but initially evade destruction due to microbial virulence factors that prevent phagolysosome formation.  In healthy individuals, the infection is controlled with the cell-mediated immune response.  However, in patients with #advanced AIDS#, the body is unable to generate sufficient CD4-mediated cytokines (eg, interferon-gamma) to activate macrophages, which allows the pathogen to spread through the bloodstream and reticuloendothelial system. $Most patients with disseminated infection have nonspecific symptoms (eg, fever, weight loss, diarrhea).  Widespread involvement of the #reticuloendothelial system# often causes anemia, hepatosplenomegaly, and/or elevated alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase.

However, additional cell wall components are often present that contribute to virulence, motility, or the ability to adhere to epithelial surfaces.  For instance, the cell wall of #group A streptococcus# (also known as Streptococcus pyogenes) is studded with #M protein#, a virulence factor that #inhibits phagocytosis#, prevents complement binding, and aids in epithelial attachment. $M protein is an alpha-helical coiled-coil protein that shares epitopes and #structural homology# with other alpha-helical coiled-coil proteins such as #tropomyosin and myosin#.  In some patients, the protective antibodies against M protein that develop in S pyogenes acute infection may @cross-react@ with myosin epitopes in the heart and cause #rheumatic carditis#. $#(Choice A)#  Efflux pumps are generally globular proteins with multiple domains.  They reside in the bacterial cell membrane and excrete toxic substances from the interior of the cell.  Bacteria can use efflux pumps to generate antibiotic resistance to drugs that operate in the interior of the cell, such as fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides. $#(Choices B and C)#  The bacterial cell wall of S pyogenes provides mechanical support and protects it from osmotic lysis.  It is composed primarily of peptidoglycan, which forms a mesh-like, @cross-linked polymer@ of peptides and sugars. $#(Choice E)#  Porins in the cell membrane aid in the movement of nutrients into bacterial cells.  They are composed of protein strands that group together to form a barrel (beta-barrel). $#Educational objective# The major virulence factor of Streptococcus pyogenes is M protein, an alpha-helical coiled-coil protein that shares structural homology with tropomyosin and myosin.  It extends from the cell wall and prevents phagocytosis, inhibits complement binding, and mediates bacterial adherence.  Antibodies against M protein form shortly after acute infection and may cross-react with epitopes on myosin, leading to rheumatic carditis.  ",

Typically, such transmission takes place during the passage of the fetus through the birth canal, but transplacental infection can also occur.  This is especially common in those women who developed acute hepatitis B infection in the third# #trimester. $The presence of HBeAg (a soluble protein that is a marker of viral replication and increased infectivity) in the mother significantly increases the risk of vertical transmission of the virus.  Were this woman HBeAg negative, her neonate's risk of infection would be 20%.  If she were HBeAg positive, however, her neonate's risk of infection would be 95%.  Moreover, should the infant become infected, his chance of progression to chronic hepatitis is 90%.

Risk is greatest in those with long-term domestic exposure to the #Triatomine bug#, which nests in thatched roofing and the cracks of adobe or unfinished brick.  Transmission occurs when the bug feeds on human blood during the night and defecates the underlying pathogen, #Trypanosoma cruzi#, into the bite wound. $Chagas disease is divided into 2 phases: $• The acute phase (8-12 weeks after transmission) is characterized by circulating @trypomastigotes@ that are detectable on blood microscopy.  Most patients are asymptomatic, but a minority develop nonspecific symptoms (eg, fever, malaise, anorexia) and inflammation/swelling at the site of inoculation (eg, eye swelling following conjunctival inoculation). $• The chronic phase begins when the immune system eliminates circulating parasitemia, leading to resolution of acute symptoms.  Patients subsequently develop a prolonged asymptomatic phase (\"indeterminate form\"), whereby serology is positive for T cruzi, but there are no symptoms, signs, detectable parasitemia, or indications of end-organ damage.  After 1-3 decades, a minority of those with asymptomatic chronic infection develop end-organ disease of the heart or gastrointestinal system. $#Chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy# is the most common complication of Chagas disease.

Diagnosis is made by identifying eggs in urine or stool, not on blood microscopy. $#Educational objective# Chagas disease is a protozoal illness that is endemic to Latin America.  Patients in rural areas are at greatest risk when their houses harbor the vector (Triatome bug) in adobe walls or thatched roofs.

This indicates that three of the penicillin-binding proteins have been altered in such a way that inhibits the binding of ceftriaxone.  Structural changes in penicillin-binding proteins that prevent ceftriaxone from binding is one mechanism for ceftriaxone resistance. $#(Choice A)#  Beta-lactamases function to degrade penicillin and cephalosporins.  Production of a beta-lactamase would prevent ceftriaxone from being able to bind to the penicillin-binding proteins.  Because ceftriaxone is so much smaller than the penicillin-binding proteins, unbound ceftriaxone would likely accumulate at one of the electrodes.  This would lead to no bands being found within the electrophoresis area. $#(Choice C)#  A salvage metabolic pathway can restore metabolic function that would otherwise be inhibited by an antibiotic such as trimethoprim or sulfamethoxazole. $#(Choice D)#  Transmembranous efflux pumps confer resistance to antibiotics that require entry into the cell to function (e.g., tetracyclines and macrolides).  However, penicillins and cephalosporins function outside of the bacterial cell at the peptidoglycan cell wall. $#(Choice E)#  Upregulation of protein synthesis can occur to overcome the effect of an antibiotic that binds to and irreversibly inhibits the action of that protein.

Although E coli can contaminate a pressure ulcer, most skin infections are caused by gram-positive organisms (eg, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus species).  This patient is far more likely to have E coli bacteremia due to a UTI. $#Educational objective# Escherichia coli is the most common cause of urinary tract infection (UTI) in both healthy adults and elderly patients.  E coli is part of the normal gastrointestinal flora, and special adhesive proteins (pili) allow some strains to colonize and ascend the urinary tract, causing UTI, pyelonephritis, and bacteremia/sepsis.  UTIs are the most common cause of E coli bacteremia.  "

  "explanation_2": "This patient's chronic cough, weight loss, cervical lymphadenopathy, and @cavitary pulmonary lesion@ suggest #active pulmonary tuberculosis# (TB).  Exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis usually results in lifelong latent infection due to the formation of granulomas, which wall off the pathogen and limit spread.  However, the formation and maintenance of granulomas rely on coordination between @monocytes and T lymphocytes@.  #Host conditions# that weaken these aspects of immune function often significantly increase the risk of reactivation TB; these include the following: $• #Chronic kidney disease# is associated with impaired function of monocytes and the cell-mediated immune response due to uremia and hypoalbuminemia.  Risk of TB is increased 6- to 50-fold in this population and is greatest in those with end-stage disease. $• #Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus# is associated with immune impairment and alterations to cytokine signaling, which weaken the development and maintenance of granulomas.  Risk of TB is greatest in those with chronic hyperglycemia (eg, this patient with hemoglobin A1c of 8.5%). $Increased risk of reactivation TB is also seen in those with immunosuppression (eg, HIV, immunomodulatory/glucocorticoid medications), substance abuse, malnutrition, and advanced age. $#(Choice A)#  A tall body habitus is often seen in Marfan syndrome.  Although these individuals have an increased risk of spontaneous pneumothorax, manifestations would include acute shortness of breath and imaging evidence of @air between the lung and chest wall@. $#(Choice B)#  Patients who work with hot tubs and swimming pools can develop hypersensitivity pneumonitis due to inhalation of Mycobacterium avium, a nontuberculous mycobacterium.  Although most cases are marked by acute dyspnea, chronic symptoms can occur.  However, imaging would generally show patchy, @ground-glass pulmonary infiltrates@, not a cavitary lesion. $#(Choice C)#  Living with pets increases the risk of asthma due to increased exposure to allergens.  Asthma is typically marked by recurrent bronchoconstriction with acute periods of dyspnea, wheeze, and cough.  Chest x-ray may show @hyperinflation and bronchial thickening@ but not cavitary infiltration. $#(Choice D)#  Travel to areas endemic for TB can increase risk of exposure and subsequent infection.  Endemic regions include India, sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia.  Denmark has a low incidence of TB; it is unlikely that the patient acquired the infection during his visit to this country. $#Educational objective# Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection is controlled by coordination between macrophages and T lymphocytes.

Therefore, most cases arise in the developing world where sanitation is poor.  Travelers who have not been vaccinated (with typhoid vaccine) are at risk and may return clinically ill. $Typhoidal Salmonella species invade enterocytes, travel from the apical to the basolateral end of the cell in vacuoles, and emerge in the intestinal submucosa.  Here, the organism is phagocytosed by macrophages but is able to evade destruction due to a specialized capsular antigen (Vi) that impairs the macrophage-mediated oxidative burst.  The pathogen subsequently replicates in an unchecked fashion within macrophages and spreads through the lymphatic and reticuloendothelial system, leading to widespread, systemic illness. $Manifestations typically develop over weeks in a step-wise fashion.  Patients usually develop a #progressive fever#, often with relative bradycardia (#pulse-temperature dissociation#), followed by abdominal pain, salmon-colored macules on the trunk (\"#rose spots#\"), and constipation or diarrhea.  Dissemination through the reticuloendothelial system often causes hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, and leukopenia.  Later, ulceration of Peyer patches (lymphoid aggregations in the small intestine submucosa) can result in gastrointestinal bleeding or intestinal perforation.  Antibiotic treatment is required to prevent complications and death. $#(Choice A)#  Malaria is transmitted by the bite of the female Anopheles mosquito and typically causes paroxysmal fever with nonspecific symptoms (eg, chills, fatigue, headache, myalgias).

Initial management is best accomplished through combination therapy with isoniazid (INH), rifampin, pyrazinamide, and either an injectable aminoglycoside or a fluoroquinolone. $#Streptomycin# is one of the older drugs in the aminoglycoside family; therefore, bacterial resistance to this antibiotic is widespread, resulting in its current usage being limited mainly to the treatment of tuberculosis, plague, and tularemia.  Like other aminoglycosides, streptomycin can be administered only parenterally.  It works by interfering with the 16s rRNA of the bacterial #30S ribosomal subunit#, thereby preventing bacterial protein synthesis.  Mutations of the genes that encode ribosomal proteins are responsible for aminoglycoside resistance because they lead to modifications in the ribosomal binding sites for these drugs.  Other resistance mechanisms to aminoglycosides include aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (eg, transferases) and mutated porins. $#(Choice B)#  Structural alteration of enzymes involved in DNA winding-unwinding is the means by which many microorganisms become resistant to fluoroquinolone antibiotics.  Fluoroquinolones inhibit the bacterial enzymes DNA gyrase (topoisomerase II) and topoisomerase IV. $#(Choice C)#  Structural alteration of enzymes involved in RNA synthesis is the mechanism through which organisms become resistant to rifampin.  Rifampin inhibits the bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, thereby preventing the transcription of DNA into mRNA. $#(Choice D)#  Decreased activity of bacterial catalase-peroxidase is a mechanism of mycobacterial resistance to INH.  Mycobacterial catalase-peroxidase is required for the initial enzymatic conversion of INH to its active metabolite within the mycobacterial cells; without this enzyme, INH is unable to inhibit mycobacterial mycolic acid synthesis. $#(Choice E)#  Increased activity of enzymes involved in cell wall polysaccharide synthesis is the means by which mycobacteria develop resistance to ethambutol.  Ethambutol interferes specifically with mycobacterial peptidoglycan cell wall synthesis, possibly through inhibition of arabinosyl transferase.  This drug is ineffective against organisms other than mycobacteria. $#Educational objective# • The aminoglycoside streptomycin inhibits protein synthesis by inactivating the 30S (small) ribosomal subunit. $• Decreased activity of bacterial catalase-peroxidase is a mechanism of mycobacterial resistance to isoniazid. $• Structural alteration of enzymes involved in RNA synthesis (DNA-dependent RNA polymerase) is the mechanism through which organisms become resistant to rifampin.

  "explanation_2": "This patient likely has disseminated gonorrheal infection (triad of arthritis, dermatitis, and tenosynovitis in a sexually active woman) due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae.  In mucosal regions as well as in secretions, IgA exists in its secretory form, composed of an IgA dimer (joined by a peptide J chain) and a peptide secretory component.  IgA antibodies usually bind to pili and other membrane proteins involved in bacterial adherence to mucosa, thus inhibiting mucosal colonization by the microorganism. $Certain bacteria (eg, N gonorrhoeae, N meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae) produce #IgA proteases# that cleave IgA at its hinge region (yielding Fab and compromised Fc fragments), thus decreasing its effectiveness.  This facilitates #bacterial adherence to mucosa# (possibly due to easier bacterial access to mucosal surface or immune disguise by binding to released Fab fragments, among others). $#(Choice B)#  IgA is a weak activator of the classic complement pathway.  Impairment of complement-mediated cell lysis can be accomplished by @staphylococcal protein A@, which binds the Fc portion of IgG, preventing complement fixation. $#(Choice C)#  Although IgA Fc-mediated functions such as opsonization are compromised by IgA protease, secretory IgA is a poor opsonin.  Impairment of opsonization and phagocytosis is most frequently accomplished by encapsulated bacteria such as S pneumoniae, N meningitidis, and H influenzae. $#(Choice D)#  IgA does not play a role in the induction of memory lymphocytes necessary for mounting a secondary immune response (which requires the formation of memory B and T lymphocytes after initial antigen exposure). $#(Choice E)#  Promotion of intracellular survival is accomplished by inhibition of phagosome-lysosome fusion or resistance to lysosomal enzymes.  These properties are expressed by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M leprae, Legionella, and Ehrlichia. $#Educational objective# IgA protease is produced by Neisseria meningitidis, N gonorrhoeae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae.  This enzyme cleaves secretory IgA at its hinge region, rendering it ineffective.  Secretory IgA exists on mucosal surfaces and in secretions and acts to bind and inhibit the action of pili as well as other cell surface antigens that normally mediate mucosal adherence and subsequent penetration.

By contrast, diphtheria toxin inactivates EF-2, not the ribosome itself.  Shigella and EHEC cause diarrheal illnesses. $#(Choice D)#  Pertussis toxin is an AB exotoxin released by Bordetella pertussis that catalyzes ribosylation of G protein αi subunits.  This results in increased cAMP production, which leads to increased insulin production, lymphocyte and neutrophil dysfunction, and increased sensitivity to histamine.  Classic pertussis has a catarrhal stage (mild upper respiratory symptoms), a paroxysmal stage (whooping cough), and a convalescent stage. $#Educational objective# Diphtheria toxin is an AB exotoxin that ribosylates and inactivates elongation factor-2.

  "explanation_2": "$#Human hookworm# infection is caused by Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale.  These pathogens are called hookworms because the head of the worm is often curved away from the body, giving the organism a \"hooked\" appearance.  Most cases occur in #tropical and subtropical# regions where sanitation is poor.  Transmission occurs when #egg-containing human feces# is deposited into shady, warm, moist soil, which allows the eggs to hatch into larvae.  Spread occurs when larvae come into direct #contact with human skin# (eg, when walking barefoot). $Dermal penetration often results in a transient, pruritic, maculopapular or serpiginous rash at the entry site.  The larvae then spread through the bloodstream to the lungs, where they rupture into the alveoli and are subsequently coughed up and swallowed.  In the small intestine, the larvae mature into adults, attach to the gastrointestinal mucosa, and feed on human blood by lacerating capillaries.  Because these organisms can live in the gastrointestinal tract for up to 14 years, total blood loss can be substantial.  Therefore, the biggest risk of hookworm infection is iron-deficiency anemia #(microcytic anemia)# due to chronic blood loss. $Although many patients with hookworm infection are asymptomatic for months or years, some individuals develop transient pulmonary symptoms (eg, cough) during pulmonary migration or gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) during gastrointestinal migration.  Diagnosis is generally made when smooth, thin-walled @hookworm eggs@ are identified by stool microscopy.  Peripheral #eosinophilia #is also an important diagnostic clue. $#(Choice A)#  Lymphatic filariasis is a mosquito-borne illness caused by roundworms (eg, Wuchereria bancrofti).  Most patients are infected in childhood and remain asymptomatic, but a minority develops chronic lymphedema, which may result in elephantiasis.  Eggs are not present in stool; diagnosis is made by serology or by identifying worms in the lymphatic system. $#(Choice B)#  Chagas disease is linked to dilated cardiomyopathy and is most common in Latin America.  It is caused by the protozoa Trypanosoma cruzi.  Transmission occurs during a triatomine bug bite.  Although transient skin and gastrointestinal symptoms can occur during acute infection, eggs are not seen in the stool; diagnosis is made mostly by serology or by blood microscopy. $#(Choice C)#  Toxocariasis is caused by infection with dog or cat roundworms.  Migrating larva cause a significant eosinophilic granulomatous response that can result in ocular (endophthalmitis) and organ damage.  Diagnosis is made by serology; the organism does not shed eggs in the gastrointestinal tract. $#(Choice E)#  Diphyllobothriasis is caused by infection with a fish tapeworm and is classically linked with megaloblastic anemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency.  Although the eggs can be seen on stool microscopy, they are distinguished by a lid-like opening (operculum).  In addition, a transient skin rash would not be a feature of this disease. $#Educational objective# Hookworms are transmitted when human skin comes into contact with soil contaminated with human feces.  The larvae penetrate the skin, travel to the lungs, are coughed up, and then subsequently swallowed.  Adult hookworms live in the small intestine and feed on human blood.  Therefore, chronic iron deficiency anemia (microcytic anemia) is the greatest complication.  ",

In addition, the presentation is usually subacute over days to weeks (vs 4 hours). $#(Choice E)#  Invasive fungal infections can occur in neutropenic patients.  However, they are typically slower growing (vs 4 hours) and are rarely the cause of an initial presentation of neutropenic fever.

It typically presents with the triad of polyarthralgia, tenosynovitis, and dermatitis (painless @pustules@ on the extremities) or purulent arthritis.  The diagnosis is confirmed when the organism is isolated on #Thayer-Martin media# (chocolate agar infused with antibiotics), which permits selective growth of Neisseria species. $N gonorrhoeae is spread primarily via infected genital secretions during #sexual contact#.  Therefore, most cases can be prevented by the #consistent use of condoms#.  Patients with genitourinary N gonorrhoeae infections may have @purulent cervicitis@ or urethritis, but many are asymptomatic.  Asymptomatic infection increases the risk of spread to deeper tissues (eg, disseminated gonococcal infection, pelvic inflammatory disease) because of treatment delay. $#(Choice A)#  Lyme disease is a tick-borne illness caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi.  Early localized Lyme disease can be associated with arthralgias, myalgias, fever, and @erythema migrans@ (a migrating, erythematous, bull's-eye rash).  However, it is not associated with tendonitis/pustules, and spirochetes cannot be cultured on Thayer-Martin media. $#(Choice B)#  N gonorrhoeae undergoes dramatic antigenic variation of its surface molecules, which prevents the formation of protective antibodies against future infection.  Therefore, recurrent infection is common and vaccinations are ineffective. $#(Choice C)#  The roundworm Trichinella can be transmitted via undercooked pork.  It invades the skeletal muscle and causes severe muscle pain, swelling, and tenderness.  Periorbital edema and eosinophilia are often important diagnostic clues; infection is typically confirmed with serology (not culture). $#(Choice E)#  @Dengue fever@, also called breakbone fever, is a mosquito-borne viral infection associated with fever, severe myalgias, arthralgias, and maculopapular rash.  Hemorrhagic complications can occur.  The diagnosis is usually made clinically; Thayer-Martin media would not yield an organism (as it is a viral pathogen). $#Educational objective# Neisseria gonorrhoeae is spread sexually by genitourinary secretions and can be prevented by the consistent use of condoms.  Genitourinary infections are often asymptomatic, which increases the risk of spread through the bloodstream, leading to disseminated gonococcal infection.  Patients with disseminated disease typically present with the triad of polyarthralgia, tenosynovitis, and dermatitis or purulent arthritis.  ",

The agglutination test may be negative at the beginning of the infection and can be repeated later for confirmation.  Because the Monospot (horse erythrocyte agglutination) test was negative on 2 separate occasions in this patient with a mononucleosis-like syndrome (fever, fatigue, splenomegaly, atypical lymphocytosis), his symptoms are #unlikely# to be due to EBV; the lack of sore throat and lymphadenopathy is also atypical for classic EBV-associated IM #(choice C).# $In immunocompetent patients with a #heterophile antibody-negative mononucleosis-like syndrome#, the most likely diagnosis is #cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection#.  Pharyngitis and lymphadenopathy are seen less commonly than with EBV.

Transfusion-acquired HCV can cause chronic hepatitis, but highly sensitive blood donor screening tests have led to low transmission rates.  Atypical lymphocytosis is less common with HCV than with EBV or CMV. $#(Choice E)#  JC virus causes progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a central nervous system viral infection seen in immunocompromised patients.  Clinical manifestations include hemiparesis, visual field defects (eg, hemianopsia), and cognitive impairment. $#(Choice F)#  Parvovirus B19 causes erythema infectiosum, a childhood illness characterized by red, flushed cheeks (\"slapped cheeks\" appearance).

Other common resistance mechanisms are the production of enzymes that inactivate the drug by altering its chemical structure or the production of an efflux pump that decreases the drug's intracellular concentration. $#(Choices B and D)#  Carbapenems and penicillins function similarly to other beta-lactam antibiotics by inhibiting a family of enzymes responsible for cell wall construction.  Resistance to both can occur through alteration of the antibiotic binding site on the enzyme; decreased permeability of the antibiotic into the cell wall; or production of beta-lactamases, which alter the antibiotic structure by cleaving protein bonds in the antibiotic and inactivating it. $#(Choice C)#  Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic used to treat methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections.  It binds to D-alanine-D-alanine, thereby preventing peptidoglycan cell wall synthesis.  Bacteria have been identified in which a D-alanine is replaced by a D-lactate, leading to vancomycin resistance. $#(Choice E)#  Resistance to the quinolones occurs by alteration of the genes encoding for DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, development of an efflux pump, or alteration of the membrane diffusion channels used by the antibiotic. $#Educational objective# Aminoglycosides work by interfering with the 30S ribosomal subunit and causing the cell to misread messenger RNA, thereby halting protein synthesis.

GAS is beta-hemolytic due to the expression of cytolysins (eg, streptolysin O), which create a @broad zone of complete hemolysis@ (not incomplete hemolysis) around plated colonies #(choice D).# $Patients with positive RADT or throat culture require antibiotic therapy (eg, amoxicillin) to prevent complications of GAS (eg, rheumatic fever), limit transmission to others, and reduce duration/severity of symptoms. $#(Choice A)#  Gram-stain cannot be used to definitively determine if GAS is present because other oropharyngeal organisms (eg, viridans streptococci) also appear as gram-positive cocci in chains. $#(Choice B)#  Antibodies against M protein, a virulence factor that coats the surface of GAS, provide protective immunity against future infections with a particular GAS strain.  However, antibody titers take several weeks to elevate after acute infection; therefore, antibody testing is not used to diagnose acute pharyngitis. $#(Choice C)#  Elevated antibody titers against streptolysin O indicate recent GAS infection and can aid the diagnosis of GAS complications (eg, rheumatic fever, glomerulonephritis).  However, antibodies against streptolysin take several weeks to form; therefore, they are not used to diagnose acute pharyngitis. $#Educational objective# Group A streptococcus (GAS) should be suspected in those with acute-onset sore throat, exudative tonsillopharyngitis, and no evidence of viral symptoms (eg, coryza, cough, conjunctivitis).  In-office throat swab with rapid antigen detection testing (immunoassay for GAS antigens) can provide on-site microbiologic confirmation, allowing for early initiation of treatment.  ",

Protease inhibitors are a common component of first-line HIV antiretroviral therapy and are denoted by medications that end in \"navir\" (eg, darunavir, atazanavir, ritonavir). $#(Choice A)#  The HIV envelope proteins gp120 and gp41 mediate viral attachment and fusion with the host cell membrane.  These proteins are generated as a polyprotein (gp160) from the env gene.  Unlike the gag-pol polyprotein (which is cleaved by HIV protease) the env polyprotein is cleaved by a host protease, so production of glycosylated viral envelope proteins is not affected by HIV protease inhibitors. $#(Choices B and D)#  The pol gene encodes the major HIV enzymes: reverse transcriptase (RT), integrase, and protease.  RT converts the HIV RNA genome into complementary double-stranded DNA; it also destroys the HIV RNA genomic template during transcription (ribonuclease H activity).  RT is inhibited by nucleoside/nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.  Integrase inserts complementary viral DNA into the host chromosome.  Integrase strand transfer inhibitors block the function of this enzyme.  Both RT and integrase inhibitors block viral replication, but neither are associated with immature virions containing polyproteins. $#(Choice E)#  The HIV genome encodes for several regulatory proteins that are required for viral replication.  However, all virus-encoded proteins are translated by host ribosomes, and blockade of protein translation would not be associated with the formation of polyproteins. $#Educational objective# The HIV genome contains 3 major structural genes that are translated as polyproteins and subsequently cleaved by host protease (env gene products) or viral protease (gag-pol gene products) into the individual proteins that compose the HIV virus.

  "explanation_2": "$#Conjugation# is a form of horizontal gene transfer that involves direct #cell-to-cell contact# between two adjacent bacteria.  It allows for the propagation of genetic elements that confer beneficial traits such as #antibiotic resistance#, the ability to use new metabolites, or the ability to tolerate a difficult microenvironment.  The transferred genetic element is a #conjugative plasmid# (separate from the genome) or an integrated conjugative element (present in the genome). $Conjugation begins when proteins encoded by the conjugative element aggregate on the plasma membrane of the donor bacteria, forming a #pilus# (a #hair-like# appendage).  The pilus elongates until it attaches to an adjacent bacterium and then progressively shortens, which pulls the bacteria together.  The plasmid DNA in the donor cell is then nicked and relaxed, and a single DNA strand is transferred through the mating bridge from the donor to the recipient bacterium.  A complementary DNA strand is then generated in each bacterium, which completes the plasmid transfer. $Conjugation is a major mechanism for #Shigella antibiotic resistance#.  A single Shigella plasmid encodes resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, sulfonamides, streptomycin, and trimethoprim.  Other plasmids encode resistance to azithromycin and fluoroquinolones.  Risk of resistant strains is greatest in patients with #HIV# and/or men who have sex with men, but antibiotic susceptibility testing is required for all infections due to high rates of resistance across patient populations. $#(Choices B and C)#  The two other forms of horizontal gene transfer are transduction and transformation.  @Transduction@ involves the introduction of foreign DNA into a bacterial cell by a virus or viral vector.  @Transformation@ involves the uptake of free DNA from the environment through the cell membrane.  Neither involves direct contact between bacterial cells or the formation of pili. $#(Choice D)#  Transposition involves the movement of a DNA sequence from one location to another within the genome (frequently with duplication of the transposon), which often results in genetic mutations due to incorrect DNA repair and/or insertional mutagenesis. $#(Choice E)#  Vertical gene transfer is the transmission of genes from parent to offspring.  This occurs in bacteria when they divide by binary fission; it does not involve pili. $#Educational objective# Conjugation is a form of horizontal gene transfer that involves the formation of a pilus and the direct passing of genetic material from one bacterium to another.  It is a common source of antibiotic resistance and environmental adaptation.  The other forms of bacterial horizontal gene transfer are transduction (viral vector) and transformation (uptake of free DNA).  ",

Initial infection is followed by life-long #latent infection# in memory B cells.  While latent, the EBV genome exists as an episome in the nucleus of infected cells and expresses a restricted subset of EBV genes (#latency genes#) which do the following: $• Promote periodic viral reactivation from memory B-cells, leading to recurrent (asymptomatic) mucosal infections. $• Promote survival of infected memory B cells by encoding for proteins (eg, EBNA-1, LMP1) that prevent apoptosis.

Although CMV can reactivate in immunocompromised individuals (eg, HIV, post-transplantation) and cause severe end-organ disease (eg, retinitis, gastroenteritis), it is not an oncogenic virus.  HHV-8 reactivation also primarily occurs in immunocompromised individuals and is associated with Kaposi sarcoma. $#(Choice F)#  The BK and JC viruses are members of Polyomaviridae and cause life-long latent infections in the kidney.  BK reactivation can cause nephropathy in renal transplant recipients, and JC virus causes progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (primarily in patients with advanced HIV). $#Educational objective# Nasopharyngeal cancer is endemic in southern China due to genetic and dietary factors that promote nasopharyngeal epithelial pre-malignant lesions.

This fungus is widely distributed in the environment and commonly grows on decaying vegetables.  It is monomorphic, existing only in mold form (ie, multicellular hyphae). $Aspergillus causes the following conditions: $• #Invasive aspergillosis# develops in #immunosuppressed patients#.  The prolonged neutropenia associated with leukemia and lymphoma treatment is a strong risk factor.  It most commonly affects the lung and can cause fever, pleuritic chest pain, and hemoptysis.  Aspergillus has a predilection for blood vessels and can spread hematogenously, causing infection and infarcts involving the skin, paranasal sinuses, kidneys, endocardium, and brain.  Diagnosis is made by light microscopy, which reveals V-shaped, narrow, septate hyphae invading the tissue.  Voriconazole is used to treat invasive aspergillosis. $• #Aspergillomas# are Aspergillus #fungus balls# that grow in old lung cavities (eg, produced by tuberculosis or bronchiectasis).  They are limited to the preexisting cavity; invasion of the surrounding lung tissue is rare in immunocompetent patients.

  "explanation_2": "This child has #impetigo#, a superficial bacterial infection that most commonly develops on the face or extremities in children.  Patients usually have mildly itchy or painful erythematous papules and pustules that later erupt, forming a @honey-colored crusting@.  The most common pathogen is Staphylococcus aureus followed by #group A Streptococcus# (GAS), specifically, Streptococcus pyogenes.  In this case, microscopy of the patient's exudate shows #gram-positive cocci in chains#, indicative of streptococcal infection. $Localized impetigo is treated with topical antibiotics and most patients have no long-term sequelae.  However, a small number of patients with impetigo due to GAS develop #poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis# (PSGN) several weeks after the initial infection.  Kidney damage is caused by immune complex deposition and subsequent complement activation, precipitating an inflammatory response that damages the glomerular basement membrane. $Presentations of PSGN range from asymptomatic, microscopic hematuria to overt #nephritic syndrome#; pyuria and nephritic-range (<3.5 g/day) proteinuria are common.  In addition to tea- or #cola-colored urine#, symptomatic patients can develop periorbital/#facial swelling#, generalized edema, and hypertension.  Laboratory evaluation typically reveals elevated creatinine and decreased C3 levels. $#(Choice A)#  Ascending weakness is a classic feature of Guillain-Barré syndrome, which may be preceded by an upper respiratory or gastrointestinal (eg, Campylobacter jejuni) tract infection.  GAS infection is not associated with this condition. $#(Choice C)#  Fatigue and a new heart murmur due to carditis can be manifestations of acute rheumatic fever (ARF), a potential poststreptococcal sequela classically associated with GAS pharyngitis.  However, ARF is not associated with impetigo in most regions of the world. $#(Choice D)#  Eye redness (due to conjunctivitis or anterior uveitis) and joint pain may be seen in reactive arthritis, which typically occurs following a diarrheal (eg, Salmonella) or genitourinary tract (eg, Chlamydia) infection, not impetigo. $#(Choice E)#  Unilateral facial drooping due to a peripheral @facial nerve palsy@ is most commonly idiopathic (ie, Bell palsy) or associated with neuroborreliosis or herpes simplex virus infection. $#Educational objective# Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is a potential complication of group A streptococcal infection (eg, impetigo, pharyngitis).  Symptoms include proteinuria (often associated with periorbital or generalized edema) and hematuria.  In most regions of the world, acute rheumatic fever is a postinfectious sequela of streptococcal pharyngitis only, not impetigo.  ",

However, transmission to humans occasionally occurs when B anthracis #spores# are inhaled, ingested, or inoculated into the skin. $Inhalation of spores into the alveoli causes #pulmonary anthrax#.  Alveolar macrophages phagocytose the spores and bring them to mediastinal lymph nodes, where the spores germinate into vegetative rods and multiply.

Initial HSV infections are marked by viral replication at the site of exposure (eg, perioral or genital skin), which leads to vesicular @mucocutaneous@ lesions and flulike symptoms.  Manifestations last a week or two and then resolve spontaneously when viral replication ceases.  However, the virus also spreads to dermal nerve terminals and is transported in a retrograde fashion to the #sensory ganglia#, where it establishes a lifelong #latent infection# within the #neuronal cell bodies#. $During latent infection, no viral replication occurs, so the disease is asymptomatic.  However, infected cells continue to produce some HSV genes (eg, latency-associated transcript gene), and stress and other triggers can reactivate viral replication and lead to the re-emergence of symptoms (eg, vesicular lesions on the oral/genital mucous membranes, low-grade fever, malaise).  Recurrent symptoms last a week or two and then resolve; they are often less severe than the initial episode. $#(Choice A)#  Although strains of malaria with dormant liver phases (eg, Plasmodium ovale, Plasmodium vivax) can cause relapsing symptoms every 6-8 weeks, this patient was diagnosed with a viral (not parasitic) infection and had infrequent relapses over years.

  "explanation_2": "This patient with an uncertain vaccination history likely died from #diphtheria#, a clinical illness caused by #toxigenic strains# of Corynebacterium diphtheriae.  The disease is rare in the developed world due to widespread vaccination with diphtheria toxoid, but outbreaks often occur in regions where vaccination efforts are insufficient (eg, Southeast Asia).  Most cases are transmitted by aerosolized droplets from asymptomatic carriers or infected patients.  Although the pathogen has little capacity for invasion, it generates a #potent exotoxin# (diphtheria toxin) that irreversibly inhibits protein synthesis through ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor-2, leading to host cell death and necrosis.  Local effects of the toxin include pharyngitis and laryngotracheitis, often with an #extensive#, #coalescing exudate# (pseudomembrane).  Absorption of the toxin into the bloodstream results in potentially life-threatening #myocarditis# and neuritis. $Diphtheria can be prevented with the diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus (DPT) childhood vaccination, which generates #neutralizing IgG antibodies# against the binding component (B subunit) of the diphtheria exotoxin.

  "explanation_2": "$#Haemophilus influenzae# is a gram-negative coccobacillus that can be either encapsulated (serotypes a-f) or unencapsulated (nontypeable).  H influenzae #type b# (Hib) is the most invasive strain due to its polyribosylribitol phosphate #(PRP) capsule#, which #inhibits complement-mediated phagocytosis# and allows it to invade tissues and survive in the bloodstream. $During the first months of life, transient immunity to Hib is accomplished by IgG antibodies acquired transplacentally from the mother while in utero.  The #Hib vaccine# is administered beginning at age 2 months to provide continued immunity.  The immunization is composed of PRP conjugated with a protein toxoid (eg, tetanus, diphtheria), which induces a T cell–dependent immune response.  The production of opsonizing anticapsular antibodies by B-lymphocytes allows for efficient phagocytosis of the bacterium.  Without the protection from the vaccine, this child is at risk for #invasive disease# caused by Hib, such as #meningitis#, bacteremia, pneumonia, and epiglottitis. $#(Choice A)#  Bronchiolitis is a lower respiratory infection that is almost always viral in etiology.  Respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, influenza, and parainfluenza are commonly implicated, but not H influenzae. $#(Choices B, D, and E)#  Most causes of bacterial conjunctivitis, acute otitis media, and sinusitis in childhood are due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, nontypeable H influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis.  The Hib vaccine (which has no effect on nontypeable H influenzae) will not protect a child from these infections. $#Educational objective# The Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine induces anticapsular antibodies that facilitate complement-mediated phagocytosis of the bacterium.  The vaccination series has drastically reduced the incidence of invasive disease caused by Hib, such as meningitis, bacteremia, pneumonia, and epiglottitis.  "

  "explanation_2": "Early #penicillin# treatment of #group A streptococcal pharyngitis# is important for the #prevention of acute rheumatic fever# (ARF), a major cause of cardiovascular death in many developing nations.  ARF primarily affects the heart and central nervous system because host antibodies produced in response to streptococcal antigens cross-react with host antigens in these organs.  Chronic cardiac inflammation can progress to rheumatic heart disease, specifically valvular disease.  The #mitral valve# is the most commonly affected and gradually thickens, fibroses, and calcifies, eventually requiring valvotomy or more invasive surgical intervention. $#Empiric therapy# for a condition must be considered in the context of the host characteristics, pre-test probability of the disease, benefits/risks of waiting for a definitive diagnosis, and cost of therapy versus its potential complications.  If all cases of acute streptococcal pharyngitis were treated empirically, the incidence of rheumatic heart disease and associated cardiac procedures would likely decrease. $#(Choice A)#  Antibiotic use can promote diarrhea by altering the gut microbial milieu.  This alteration can lead to overgrowth of Clostridium difficile, a gram-positive bacterium that can cause profuse, watery diarrhea and life-threatening fulminant colitis.  Therefore, increasing antibiotic use would likely result in increased diarrheal illness and potential complications. $#(Choice B)#  Serum sickness-like reactions are associated with certain infections (eg, hepatitis B) and antibiotics (eg, penicillin).  The development of circulating drug-specific immune complexes may cause fever, rash, and arthritis.  If penicillin was used more frequently, serum sickness-like reactions would potentially increase, not decrease. $#(Choice C)#  Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) is the most common cause of nephritic syndrome in children worldwide.  It is caused by deposition of immune complexes in glomeruli following pharyngitis or skin infections with group A Streptococcus.  Although early antibiotics are effective in preventing ARF, they have not been shown to reduce the risk of PSGN. $#(Choice E)#  Empiric use of potentially unnecessary antibiotics may cause an increase in antibiotic resistance, thereby increasing the need for broad-spectrum antibiotics.  For example, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) evolved from methicillin-sensitive S aureus via alteration of the protein binding site for beta-lactam antibiotics.  As a result, broad-spectrum antibiotics (eg, vancomycin, daptomycin) are required for MRSA infections. $#Educational objective# Acute rheumatic fever is a complication of untreated group A streptococcal pharyngitis.  Rheumatic heart disease is the most common cause of acquired valvular heart disease and cardiovascular death in developing countries.  The incidence of acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease has been reduced in industrialized nations with prompt treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis with penicillin.  "

  "explanation_2": "This patient most likely has #typhoid fever#, an #invasive# Salmonella infection.  #Salmonella# species are gram-negative, non–lactose-fermenting, motile enteric rods divided into nontyphoidal and typhoidal strains.  Both strains penetrate enterocytes, where they travel in vacuoles from the apical to the basolateral end of the cell and invade the lamina propria.  However, the pathogenesis then diverges, as follows: $• Nontyphoidal strains (eg, S Enteritidis) are phagocytosed by neutrophils and macrophages in the lamina propria and induce a massive inflammatory response with neutrophilic infiltration.  This cytokine-mediated response causes gastroenteritis (eg, watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever), which usually self-resolves, as in this patient's prior history. $• In contrast, #typhoidal strains# contain specialized virulence factors (eg, Vi capsular antigen) that #inhibit neutrophil recruitment and phagocytosis#, limiting the acute inflammatory response that helps contain nontyphoidal species.  It also inhibits macrophages from generating an oxidative burst to destroy the bacteria, allowing the pathogen to undergo extensive, #unchecked intraphagocytic replication# and dissemination through the lymphatic and reticuloendothelial system.  This results in typhoid fever, as seen in this patient. $Manifestations begin approximately a week after transmission of the typhoidal strain, which typically occurs via consumption of food or water contaminated by human feces in regions of poor sanitation.  Initial symptoms include an #escalating fever# that is often associated with relative bradycardia (#pulse-temperature dissociation#).  A week later, patients typically develop abdominal pain, diarrhea or constipation, hepatosplenomegaly, and transient salmon-colored macules (#rose spots#) on the trunk.  Blood culture is diagnostic. $#(Choice A)#  Contact between Entamoeba histolytica and the host cell results in insertion of an amebic channel-forming protein in the host cell membrane, causing cell death.  Symptoms include bloody diarrhea and/or extraintestinal manifestations (eg, liver abscess).  Rash is uncommon, and blood cultures would not show gram-negative rods. $#(Choice B)#  Campylobacter infection causes acute, self-limited diarrhea (<7 days) and may result in cross-reacting antibodies to ganglioside GM1, leading to Guillain-Barré syndrome.  Rose spots, hepatosplenomegaly, and pulse-temperature dissociation would not be expected. $#(Choice D)#  Rotavirus and Giardia damage intestinal villi, leading to intestinal malabsorption due to villous blunting and decreased levels of brush border enzymes (eg, maltase, lactase). $#Educational objective# Typhoidal strains of Salmonella contain a capsular antigen (Vi) and other virulence factors that inhibit neutrophil phagocytosis, neutrophil recruitment, and macrophage-mediated destruction.  Therefore, typhoidal Salmonella undergoes extensive replication in macrophages and is able to spread through the lymphatic and reticuloendothelial system, leading to widespread systemic disease (typhoid fever).

  "explanation_2": "$Although fever and fatigue are nonspecific symptoms, this patient's peripheral blood smear is diagnostic of #malaria#, a disease caused by 4 main species of #Plasmodium#.  The most common species is Plasmodium falciparum, which is endemic to #sub-Saharan Africa#, New Guinea, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti.  The second most prevalent species is Plasmodium vivax, which is endemic to Central and South America and the western Pacific region.  The 2 other species (Plasmodium ovale, Plasmodium malariae) are responsible for only a small minority of cases. $Malaria is most often diagnosed by examination of a peripheral blood smear with Giemsa staining.  Because each of the 4 main species appears differently on blood smear, this test also helps identify the infecting species.  In P falciparum infection, red blood cells have #multiple small rings# representing developing #trophozoites# (arrows) and banana-shaped gametocytes (not shown). $For malaria acquired in @areas@ known to have chloroquine-sensitive organisms, chloroquine is the treatment of choice.  However, most African Plasmodium species are #chloroquine resistant# and require treatment with #atovaquone-proguanil# or #artemisinins#, which are well tolerated and have excellent cure rates.  Because P vivax and P ovale have dormant liver forms (hypnozoites), primaquine therapy should be added to the treatment regimen for these species. $#(Choice A)#  Amphotericin B is used to treat leishmaniasis, a parasitic disease transmitted by sandflies.  It is endemic to Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Americas.  Visceral disease is typically marked by subacute fever, malaise, abdominal pain, and splenomegaly.  @Giemsa stain@ usually shows spherical/ovoid bodies (amastigotes) and rod-shaped inclusions (kinetoplast) in the skin/viscera. $#(Choice C)#  Diethylcarbamazine treats filariasis, a nematode infection of the lymphatics and subcutaneous tissue transmitted by mosquito vectors.  Giemsa stain of a thick smear of blood would show @microfilariae@. $#(Choice D)#  Nifurtimox is used to treat trypanosomiasis, a protozoal illness endemic to Africa that causes sleeping sickness.  CNS manifestations (eg, altered personality, stupor, excessive daytime somnolence) are prominent due to meningoencephalitis.  Giemsa stain would show @trypanosomes@. $#(Choice E)#  Because most species of Plasmodium are now resistant to pyrimethamine, it is not typically used in treatment of malaria.  Pyrimethamine can be used to treat toxoplasmosis, which most often causes symptomatic disease (eg, encephalitis) in patients with AIDS. $#Educational objective# Blood microscopy findings that show red blood cells filled with multiple small rings suggest Plasmodium infection (malaria).  Erythrocytic forms of this parasite are treated with antimalarials such as chloroquine (in nonresistant areas), atovaquone-proguanil, or artemisinins.

Lobar pneumonia is most commonly caused by extracellular bacterial pathogens such as Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae #(choices A, D, and E)#.  The immune response to extracellular organisms is primarily mediated by neutrophils early in infection and by the humoral antibody response (B lymphocytes, immunoglobulins, complement) as time goes on. $In this case, components of the #cell-mediated immune response# were primarily involved in controlling the infection, suggesting that the pneumonia was most likely due to an #intracellular pathogen# such as #Legionella pneumophila# (a common cause of atypical community-acquired pneumonia).  Intracellular pathogens are phagocytosed by macrophages but are initially resistant to destruction due to the presence of virulence factors that inhibit phagosome-lysosome fusion (eg, Legionella) or phagolysosome acidification (eg, Mycobacteria tuberculosis), or allow bacteria to escape from the phagolysosome (eg, Listeria monocytogenes). $Legionella and other intracellular pathogens that initially replicate within the phagosome eventually undergo some degree of digestion by lysosomes, leading to the display of bacterial antigens on major histocompatibility complex @(MHC) class II molecules@.  This stimulates naïve CD4 T lymphocytes to differentiate into #T-helper subtype 1 (Th1) cells#.  Th1 cells release #interferon-gamma#, which activates macrophages and allows them to form fully mature (acidified) phagolysosomes capable of efficiently killing the intracellular bacteria.  Th1 cells also release #interleukin-2#, which activates and expands the population of naïve T cells, Th1 cells, and memory T cells. $#(Choice C)#  Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common cause of pneumonia in patients who are hospitalized in the intensive care unit or those with structural lung disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  It is an extracellular pathogen primarily combated by neutrophils and the humoral immune response. $#Educational objective# Intracellular bacterial organisms such as Legionella pneumophila are primarily countered by the cell-mediated immune response.  Intracellular pathogens that replicate within phagosomes (eg, Legionella, Mycobacterium tuberculosis) trigger activation and differentiation of T-helper subtype 1 cells with subsequent macrophage activation via interferon-gamma.

  "explanation_2": "#Malaria# is transmitted when an infected female Anopheles mosquito injects Plasmodium sporozoites into a human during a bite.  The sporozoites travel through the bloodstream to the liver, where they infect hepatocytes and mature into schizonts.  Within days to a few weeks, liver schizonts rupture the hepatocytes, releasing thousands of merozoites into the bloodstream. $Merozoites from different species of malaria have different affinities for erythrocytes.  Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale primarily infect very young, large erythrocytes recently released from the bone marrow (ie, reticulocytes), whereas Plasmodium malariae primarily infects old erythrocytes that have been in the bloodstream for months.  In contrast, #Plasmodium falciparum# has the unique ability to infect #erythrocytes of all ages#. $Because P falciparum can target a much larger pool of erythrocytes, patients infected with this species typically have much #greater levels of parasitemia# than those infected with other species.  In addition, P falciparum has a unique ability to significantly increase cytoadherence molecules on the surface of infected erythrocytes, leading to increased risk for microvascular adhesion with subsequent tissue ischemia.  The combination of a high degree of parasitemia and a high risk for #microvascular adhesion# make P falciparum the most severe and deadly species of malaria. $#(Choice A)#  All Plasmodium species that cause malaria rely primarily on anaerobic metabolism because they are unable to perform oxidative phosphorylation in their mitochondria.  Parasite anaerobic glycolysis likely contributes to the hypoglycemia and acidosis (eg, lactic acidosis) typically seen in severe malaria. $#(Choice B)#  All Plasmodium species that cause malaria digest hemoglobin in vacuoles to supply the parasite with amino acids.  This generates hemozoin, a toxic metabolite identified by macrophages in the reticuloendothelial system, leading to erythrocyte pruning and, often, splenomegaly. $#(Choice D)#  Although most strains of P falciparum are resistant to chloroquine due to point mutations in the chloroquine resistance transporter protein, this does not account for the high degree of parasitemia seen with P falciparum infections. $#(Choice E)#  P vivax and P ovale develop a dormant form in the liver that can reactivate months or a few years later.  This is not a feature of P falciparum and does not contribute to the high degree of parasitemia seen with this species. $#Educational objective# Plasmodium falciparum can achieve much higher levels of parasitemia than other species of malaria due to its ability to infect erythrocytes of all ages.  In contrast, Plasmodium ovale and Plasmodium vivax primarily infect reticulocytes, and Plasmodium malariae primarily infects old erythrocytes.  "

Those who are colonized and do not receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis can transmit the bacteria to the fetus during passage through the vaginal canal, leading to neonatal sepsis (eg, irritability, lethargy, grunting, tachypnea, temperature instability, hypotension) within hours of birth. $GBS is a leading cause of #early neonatal sepsis# and can be identified by the following laboratory features: $• #Narrow zone of beta-hemolysis# (clear) when plated on blood agar. $• #Production of CAMP factor#, a phospholipase that enhances the activity of beta-hemolysins secreted by certain strains of Staphylococcus aureus.  Testing for CAMP factor #(CAMP test)# can confirm the presence of GBS; this test plates suspected GBS colonies perpendicular to an appropriate S aureus strain and evaluates for enhanced areas of hemolysis (arrow-shaped zones in the image above). $GBS is also catalase-negative (as are all streptococci), contains the Lancefield group B antigen in its cell wall, and hydrolyzes hippurate. $#(Choice A)#  Escherichia coli, a gram-negative rod, is a common cause of early neonatal sepsis.  Although E coli generates beta-hemolysins, it does not produce CAMP factor; therefore, enhancement of S aureus hemolysis does not occur. $#(Choice B)#  Enterococcus faecalis, a gram-positive cocci, is a common cause of sepsis in preterm neonates but is rare in those born at term.  In addition, it does not hemolyze red blood cells (gamma hemolytic) or generate camp factor. $#(Choice C)#  Staphylococcus epidermidis, a gram-positive coccus that grows in clusters, is a common skin commensal that does not cause hemolysis when plated on blood agar. $#(Choice E)#  Streptococcus pneumoniae, a lancet-shaped, gram-positive bacterium, is alpha-hemolytic (partial, green hemolysis) in aerobic conditions and beta-hemolytic in anaerobic conditions.  It does not generate CAMP factor. $#Educational objective# Streptococcus agalactiae (group B Streptococcus), one of the most common causes of early neonatal sepsis, is typically identified by the presence of a narrow zone of beta-hemolysis when plated on blood agar.

  "explanation_2": "The serologic markers for hepatitis B infection appear on a predictable timeline with a long asymptomatic incubation period (lasting an average of 6-8 weeks) followed by acute disease lasting several weeks to months.  HBsAg first appears before the onset of symptoms, peaks when the patient is most ill, and then becomes undetectable in 3-6 months (unless the disease progresses to a chronic phase).  Shortly after HBsAg first appears, HBeAg and HBV DNA can be detected in the serum and are markers of active viral replication.  Anti-HBcAg IgM and elevated serum transaminases appear shortly before symptom onset.  Over the next few months, the anti-HBcAg IgM component is replaced with an IgG component.  Anti-HBeAg appears shortly after HBeAg vanishes and suggests subsiding viral activity (transition from high viral replication/infectivity to low viral replication/infectivity).  Anti-HBsAg IgG arises once the acute disease has resolved (unless the disease progresses to a chronic phase), and is typically not detectable until weeks or months after HBsAg has disappeared.  This antibody may persist indefinitely, conferring lifelong immunity. $Given this serologic marker graph, it appears that this patient has a persistence of HBsAg and HBeAg over a long period with low to moderate levels of anti-HBcAg IgG and no detectable Anti-HBsAg.  These findings are suggestive of an acute hepatitis B infection that has not resolved, but rather has progressed to a highly infectious chronic hepatitis B (note the persistence of HBeAg and lack of anti-HBeAg). $#(Choice A)#  Were this patient to have fully recovered from his bout of acute hepatitis B, all antigens should have dropped to undetectable levels and he should have high levels of anti-HBsAg IgG and anti-HBcAg IgG. $#(Choice B)#  An exacerbation of preexisting hepatitis B would be characterized by a decline followed by a spike in antigen levels. $#(Choice C)#  Acute hepatitis B that progressed to chronic hepatitis with low infectivity would be indicated by a graph similar to the one shown for this patient.  However, there would be low or undetectable levels of HBeAg (the marker for high infectivity) and likely detectable quantities of anti-HBeAg. $#(Choice E)#  Vaccination against HBV would be identified by a surge in anti-HBsAb with no anti-HBcAg, anti-HBeAg, or viral antigens detected. $#Educational objective# If HBeAg persists for several months and host anti-HBeAg remain at low or undetectable levels, suspect chronic hepatitis B infection with high infectivity.

Nonspecific neonatal findings of jaundice and hepatosplenomegaly are often present; #diffuse intracranial calcifications# are the classic finding on imaging. $Parasitic spread of Toxoplasma begins via infected cats (host), which excrete oocysts that contaminate soil and water.  Humans typically acquire the infection due to either of the following: $• Incidental ingestion of oocysts from #cat feces# (eg, handling kitty litter, consuming unwashed produce) $• Consumption of #undercooked meat# from farm animals that ingested oocysts and developed tissue infection $Ingestion of contaminated meat is the most common method of spread in pregnancy.  Therefore, although maternal infection is often asymptomatic, pregnant women are advised to #avoid# raw, cured, and undercooked meat to reduce the risk of infection and transplacental transmission to the fetus. $#(Choice A)#  Preconception maternal immunization with the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine can prevent congenital rubella infection.  Characteristic features of congenital rubella include hearing loss, cataracts (cloudy cornea), and cardiac defects (eg, patent ductus arteriosus), none of which are seen in this patient.  Moreover, retinal lesions and hydrocephalus are uncommon, and rubella is a virus, not a crescent-shaped, intracellular parasite. $#(Choice C)#  Pregnant women should avoid, not preferentially consume, unpasteurized milk products, primarily to prevent congenital Listeria monocytogenes infection, which can lead to multiorgan abscesses or fetal demise.  Although rare, Toxoplasma and other pathogens can also spread through raw milk. $#(Choice D)#  Malaria, a parasitic infection transmitted by mosquitoes, can cause intrauterine infection, but infants with congenital malaria typically present with fever and anemia, not hydrocephalus and chorioretinitis.  In addition, although Plasmodium falciparum is a crescent-shaped intracellular organism, placental biopsy would show intervillous accumulation of parasitized red blood cells without calcifications. $#(Choice E)#  Prophylactic penicillin is used during labor to prevent group B Streptococcus (GBS) transmission to the fetus during delivery.  Infection typically leads to early neonatal sepsis (eg, lethargy, hypoxia, temperature instability), findings not seen in this patient.  Moreover, in contrast to this patient's pathologic findings, GBS is a gram-positive coccus that forms chains. $#Educational objective# Pregnant women should avoid consumption of undercooked meat to prevent infection with Toxoplasma gondii, an intracellular, crescent-shaped parasite that can cross the placenta to the fetus.

Fungemia in the setting of a vascular catheter is uncommon. $#(Choice E)#  Right-angle branching hyphae are characteristic of mucormycosis, a mold infection primarily due to Mucorales or @Rhizopus@ species.  These infections can cause invasive disease in immunocompromised patients, including angioinvasive infections, but the organisms do not grow in blood cultures and are not associated with intravascular catheters. $#Educational objective# The presence of a central vascular catheter and receipt of parenteral nutrition are risk factors for candidemia.

  "explanation_2": "This patient's opportunistic infection (oropharyngeal/esophageal candidiasis), positive HIV immunoassay testing, and low CD4 count suggest a diagnosis of #AIDS#.  However, she has no detectable HIV-1 RNA in her bloodstream.  Although HIV-1 causes most cases of AIDS worldwide (and nearly all cases in the United States), AIDS can also be due to infection with #HIV-2#, which is endemic to #West Africa# (eg, Senegal). $Patients infected with HIV-2 have much #lower levels of viremia# than those infected with HIV-1.  Because viremia is directly correlated with transmission risk, rate of CD4 count decline, and progression to AIDS, individuals with HIV-2 are usually less infectious and have #longer asymptomatic periods# than patients with HIV-1.  The diagnosis of HIV-2 is often suspected when #HIV test results are incongruent#; most patients will have the following laboratory results: $• #Positive fourth-generation HIV testing# (HIV antigen/antibody test) – This test evaluates for the presence of p24 antigen and HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies but does not usually differentiate between HIV-1 and HIV-2. $• #Indeterminate or negative HIV-1 confirmatory testing# – HIV-1 Western blot evaluates for proteins in HIV-1 and is usually indeterminate in the setting of HIV-2 infection.  Plasma HIV-1 RNA testing will be negative. $Confirmation of HIV-2 infection can be made using an HIV-1/HIV-2 differentiation immunoassay.  Treatment with antiretroviral therapy is required to prevent HIV-2 disease progression.  However, nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and fusion inhibitors must be avoided because HIV-2 is intrinsically resistant to these HIV medications. $#(Choice A)#  False-positive HIV serology can be seen in the setting of cross-reacting antibodies due to pregnancy, rheumatic disease, and malignancy.  Although patients with cross-reacting antibodies have negative plasma HIV RNA, they would not have low CD4 counts or an AIDS-defining illness (eg, esophageal thrush). $#(Choice B)#  HIV attacks host cells by @binding@ to the host CD4 receptor and CCR5 (or CXCR4) chemokine coreceptor.  Homozygous deletion to CCR5 usually prevents HIV infection because the virus is not able to enter host cells; these individuals would not typically develop low CD4 count or signs of AIDS. $#(Choice C)#  X4 strains of HIV-1 use the chemokine receptor CXCR4 as a coreceptor during viral entry into host cells.  Patients who are infected with X4 strains have positive plasma HIV-1 RNA. $#(Choice E)#  The window period occurs during early HIV infection when serologic testing and antigen testing for HIV are not yet positive.  This patient had positive HIV antigen/antibody testing; therefore, she is not in the window period. $#Educational objective# Most cases of AIDS worldwide are caused by HIV-1.  However, AIDS can also be caused by infection with HIV-2, which is endemic to West Africa.  HIV-2 infection is associated with lower viral loads, less risk of transmission, and a slower progression to AIDS.  The diagnosis is often suspected when HIV tests are incongruent (positive screening serology but indeterminate Western blot and negative plasma HIV-1 RNA).

  "explanation_2": "#Bacillus anthracis# is a gram-positive, sporulating bacterium that primarily affects herbivores (eg, sheep, cows) that graze on contaminated pastures.  However, transmission to humans can occasionally occur due to inhalation, ingestion, or cutaneous inoculation of B anthracis spores.  Risk is greatest in those who handle contaminated hides, animal hair (eg, wool), or carcasses.  Cutaneous exposure usually results in a painless papule that rapidly ulcerates and subsequently turns into a black eschar. $B anthracis spores germinate at tissue temperatures into vegetative rods that have 2 main virulence factors: $• A #polypeptide capsule# composed of poly-γ-D-glutamic acid, which inhibits phagocytosis $• A #trimeric exotoxin# composed of protective antigen, edema factor, and lethal factor $Protective antigen binds to a host cell membrane receptor on macrophages and forms a channel that delivers lethal factor and edema factor into the cell.  Lethal factor is a zinc metalloproteinase that inhibits MAP kinase signal transduction, leading to cell death.  Edema factor is a #calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase# that increases cyclic AMP concentration, leading to accumulation of fluid within/between cells and suppression of neutrophil and macrophage function. $The mechanism of action of edema factor is very similar to that of the #adenylate cyclase toxin# produced by #Bordetella pertussis#.  Adenylate cyclase toxin is also a calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase that increases cAMP concentration, leading to edema and phagocyte dysfunction.  This results in localized immunosuppression that allows B pertussis to colonize the respiratory tract.  The other major B pertussis exotoxin is pertussis toxin, which increases cAMP concentration via ADP-ribosylation of a membrane G-protein. $#(Choices B and C)#  Both Clostridium botulinum and C difficile are sporulating bacteria whose vegetative forms generate exotoxins.  However, the exotoxins produced by these bacteria operate by different mechanisms than edema factor or lethal factor.  Botulinum toxin is an endopeptidase that blocks neuromuscular cholinergic transmission; toxins A and B (generated by C difficile) inactivate Rho family proteins, leading to a derangement of cytoskeletal structure and guanosine triphosphate signal transduction. $#(Choice D)#  Shigella dysenteriae invades colonic mucosal cells and produces Shiga toxin, an exotoxin that cleaves a peptide off the 60S ribosomal subunit and causes irreversible inhibition of protein synthesis. $#(Choice E)#  Streptococcus pyogenes strains that have been exposed to a specific lysogenic bacteriophage produce pyrogenic exotoxins, which cause scarlet fever and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome.  These exotoxins are proteases that degrade host cell proteins or nonspecifically activate T cells (superantigens). $#Educational objective# Bacillus anthracis edema factor is an adenylate cyclase that increases intracellular cyclic AMP, leading to neutrophil and macrophage dysfunction and tissue edema.  This mechanism of action is similar to that of adenylate cyclase toxin, produced by Bordetella pertussis.  "

This highly virulent pathogen is endemic to areas of North and South America, Asia, Africa, and Russia.  It is primarily transmitted by #rodent fleas#. $Manifestations begin with rapidly progressive fever, chills, weakness, and headache.  #Painful regional lymphadenopathy# develops concurrently or within a few days; lymph nodes #swell#, develop overlying erythema, and often drain #purulent fluid# (buboes).  When left untreated, plague progresses to sepsis with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); the disease is sometimes called \"black death\" due to tissue necrosis from DIC. $The most common first-line treatment for plague is an #aminoglycoside#.  This class of antibiotic #prevents bacterial protein synthesis# by binding with high affinity to the #30S ribosomal subunit#.  Aminoglycosides have particular potency against the Enterobacteriaceae family, Francisella tularensis, and Y pestis. $#(Choice A)#  Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole blocks bacterial dihydrofolate formation and reduction, which inhibits the generation of purine nucleic acids for DNA synthesis and repair.  Although trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole can be used for plague, it is not a first-line therapy due to overall low efficacy (mortality rate 20-30%). $#(Choice C)#  Penicillin agents inhibit the bacterial enzyme transpeptidase, which catalyzes the final cross-linking step in @peptidoglycan elongation@.  Although penicillin antibiotics are often administered with gentamicin to treat infection with gram-positive organisms (penicillin disrupts the cell wall so gentamicin can enter the cytoplasm), Y pestis is a gram-negative pathogen; therefore, penicillins are not helpful. $#(Choice D)#  Azole antibiotics inhibit the fungal enzyme 14 alpha-demethylase, which helps generate ergosterol.  Ergosterol is a crucial component of the cell membrane of yeasts.  Bacteria would be unaffected by inhibition of this fungal enzyme. $#(Choice E)#  Vancomycin binds to the D-alanyl–D-alanine terminus of peptidoglycan, which blocks transpeptidase from elongating the peptidoglycan chain.  Although vancomycin is sometimes used for streptococcal or staphylococcal adenitis, it has no efficacy against gram-negative pathogens. $#Educational objective# Yersinia pestis, the cause of bubonic plague, is transmitted primarily by rodent fleas.

  "explanation_2": "This patient's acute febrile illness with tender, erythematous inguinal lymphadenopathy likely indicates #bubonic plague#, a zoonotic infection endemic to North/South America, Africa, Asia, and Russia.  The causative pathogen is #Yersinia pestis#, a small gram-negative bacillus/coccobacillus that exhibits #bipolar staining# (resembling a safety pin) on Giemsa or Wright stain.  Although many small mammals harbor the bacteria, #rodents# (eg, rats) are the primary environmental reservoir.  Transmission most often occurs when a #flea# that fed on an infected rodent regurgitates the bacteria while biting a human.  Therefore, the most likely source of this patient's infection is close contact with rodent-infested areas (eg, changing #rodent traps#). $After cutaneous inoculation, Y pestis travels via lymphatic channels to regional lymph nodes and triggers a significant inflammatory reaction.  Manifestations typically begin with acute fever, chills, weakness, and headache; #buboes# (painful, swollen, erythematous lymph nodes) develop shortly thereafter.  Prompt treatment with an antibiotic (eg, aminoglycoside) is generally curative. $#(Choices A and F)#  Brucellosis most often develops following consumption of unpasteurized animal products (eg, sheep milk) or contact with infected animals (eg, cattle, pigs, sheep, goats).  Manifestations (eg, fever, night sweats, arthralgias) progress slowly and are often nonspecific, but painful regional lymphadenitis would be atypical; in addition, microscopic examination would reveal small, intracellular gram-negative rods. $#(Choice B)#  The handling of animal hides can transmit anthrax, which often causes systemic symptoms and regional lymphadenitis.  However, patients usually have a large necrotic skin ulcer with central eschar and surrounding erythema at the inoculation site.  In addition, Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent, is a gram-positive, spore-forming rod. $#(Choice C)#  Hunting and skinning small mammals (eg, rabbits, squirrels) is a common cause of tularemia, which often presents with painful regional lymphadenitis and fever.  However, patients usually develop a papular lesion at the inoculation site that ulcerates.  Although Francisella tularensis, the causative pathogen, is also a gram-negative coccobacillus, it is not associated with bipolar staining. $#(Choice D)#  Cleaning a chicken coop can transmit Histoplasma capsulatum, a dimorphic fungus that primarily resides in soil contaminated with bird or bat droppings.  Most cases present with pulmonary infiltrates, mediastinal/hilar lymphadenopathy, and systemic symptoms.  Regional lymphadenitis would be uncommon; in addition, the organism is a fungus, not a coccobacillus. $#Educational objective# Bubonic plague causes a febrile illness with regional inflammatory lymphadenopathy (buboes).

  "explanation_2": "This patient's recent travel, transient pulmonary symptoms, and subsequent gastrointestinal manifestations are suspicious for a #parasitic infection# involving the lungs and intestines.  Stool microscopy reveals an oval egg with a @thick outer shell@ and a single interior ovum, thereby confirming #Ascaris lumbricoides# (roundworm) infection. $A lumbricoides is a common parasitic infection in Asia, Africa, and South America.  Most cases in the United States arise in #travelers# to these regions.  Transmission occurs when #eggs are ingested# via contaminated food or water.  Eggs hatch into larvae in the small intestine, penetrate the intestinal wall, and #migrate to the alveoli#, where they mature.  Pulmonary infection is generally asymptomatic, but a minority of infected individuals develop #Loeffler syndrome#, a transient, #eosinophilic pneumonitis# with pulmonary symptoms (eg, dry cough, dyspnea, wheezing). $After several days, larvae are coughed out of the alveoli and subsequently swallowed into the gastrointestinal tract, where they mature into long (25- to 35-cm) @adult worms@ that shed up to 200,000 eggs per day.  Most gastrointestinal infections are asymptomatic, but some patients have abdominal discomfort, nausea/vomiting, and diarrhea.  The diagnosis of #gastrointestinal tract infection# is made by inspecting the stool for eggs; treatment with antiparasitic drugs (eg, albendazole) is generally curative. $#(Choice A)#  Rheumatic fever is associated with the formation of cross-reacting antibodies to renal, neuronal, and cardiac antigens following group A Streptococcus pharyngitis.  Eggs would not be seen in stool. $#(Choice B)#  Hypersensitivity pneumonitis, an immune reaction to an inhaled agent, can occur following exposure to mold dust or spores.  Patients generally develop acute fever, nausea, cough, and dyspnea.  However, wheezing is uncommon, and eggs would not be shed in stool. $#(Choice C)#  Chagas disease, a parasitic infection caused by @Trypanosoma cruzi@, can cause myopericarditis during acute infection.  However, cardiac and gastrointestinal manifestations are much more likely to occur years or decades later.  In addition, T cruzi is not shed in stool; it can sometimes be visualized on blood smear. $#(Choice E)#  Type IV hypersensitivity reactions are mediated by T cells and are often seen as part of certain drug reactions (eg, Stevens-Johnson syndrome).  In contrast, Ascaris infections are associated with IgE-mediated (eosinophilic) hypersensitivity. $#Educational objective# Ascaris lumbricoides is transmitted via contaminated food or water.  Eggs hatch into larvae in the small intestine, penetrate the intestinal wall, and migrate across the lung into the alveoli.  Larvae are subsequently coughed up and swallowed into the gastrointestinal tract, where they mature to adult worms.  Most patients are asymptomatic, but some develop early pulmonary manifestations (Loeffler syndrome) or later gastrointestinal symptoms.  ",

However, the greatest cause of neutropenic fever is endogenous bacterial flora. $#(Choice D)#  The reactivation of latent bacterial (eg, tuberculosis) and viral (eg, cytomegalovirus) pathogens is common in those with sustained impairments to cellular immunity (eg, AIDS, immunosuppression following transplantation, immunotherapy for rheumatologic conditions).  Neutropenia following chemotherapy is typically transient; the majority of infections in this setting are due to the invasion of commensal bacteria through damaged gastrointestinal epithelium.  Reactivation of latent viral or bacterial infections can occur but is far less common. $#(Choice E)#  Vector-borne and zoonotic organisms are not a primary cause of neutropenic fever in patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy.  These pathogens are common in travelers to developing nations. $#Educational objective# Chemotherapy-associated neutropenic fever is most often caused by endogenous commensal bacteria that have translocated across damaged mucosal sites.

Tenofovir is a common part of first-line HIV therapy.  It is an adenosine analogue that is a member of the #nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors# (NRTIs).  NRTIs prevent reverse transcriptase from converting the HIV RNA genome into complementary double-stranded DNA, which inhibits viral replication. $Tenofovir is primarily eliminated via the proximal tubule cells of the kidney.  High concentrations of tenofovir in these cells can interfere with mitochondrial DNA synthesis and result in cellular damage.

Patients may have proteinuria, edema, hypertension, and/or acute kidney injury.  However, they usually also have red/brown urine and biopsy evidence of diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis. $#(Choice E)#  Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is often used in patients with advanced AIDS to prevent Pneumocystis pneumonia and/or Toxoplasma gondii.  It can cause interstitial nephritis and acute kidney injury but does not usually cause focal damage to the proximal tubule. $#Educational objective# Tenofovir is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor that is a common component of HIV therapy.

S epidermidis is adept at causing foreign body infections because of its ability to form biofilms. $Once introduced into the body, foreign bodies quickly become coated with a layer of host proteins, including fibrinogen and fibronectin.  These proteins then serve as binding sites for S epidermidis.  After attachment occurs, the bacteria multiply and communicate with one another to induce synthesis of an extracellular polysaccharide matrix that encases the bacteria.  The resulting biofilm functions as a barrier to antibiotic penetration and interferes with host defenses, including opsonization, neutrophil migration, and even T lymphocyte activation.  Once mature, these biofilms can disperse individual pathogen \"seeds\" (planktonic cells) into the bloodstream and surrounding areas, further disseminating the infection.

Prior to the 1980s, the leading cause was gram-negative aerobic organisms such as Escherichia coli that spread from primary infections in the genitourinary or gastrointestinal tract.  However, the increasing use of #intravascular catheters#, which provide a portal of entry for #skin flora# to reach the bloodstream, has led to a shift in the underlying microbiology of BSI; most cases are now caused by skin commensals such as #coagulase-negative staphylococci# and #Staphylococcus aureus#. $BSI is most common in those who have #long-term# (>12 days) central venous access as this provides sufficient time for skin flora to colonize the internal/external lumen of the catheter, to replicate within a biofilm of host (fibrin) and bacterial (glycoprotein) components, and to subsequently spread to the bloodstream.  BSI should be suspected when a patient with an intravascular catheter develops new-onset fever or bacteremia. $#(Choice A)#  Although S aureus is a leading cause of infective endocarditis in patients with artificial heart valves, bacteremia is much more commonly caused by intravascular devices. $#(Choice B)#  The increased use of broad-spectrum antibiotics is associated with the development of drug-resistant organisms, including methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA).  Although MRSA is a common cause of skin abscess and necrotizing pneumonia, the majority of S aureus bacteremia is caused by intravascular catheters. $#(Choice C)#  Injection drug use is a major risk factor for S aureus abscess, bacteremia, and infective endocarditis.  However, injection drug use causes far fewer BSIs than intravenous catheters. $#(Choice D)#  Immunosuppression increases the risk of BSI due to reduced immunosurveillance.  However, BSI is far more often due to the use of intravascular catheters. $#(Choice E)#  Indwelling urinary catheters increase the risk of urinary infection with subsequent hematogenous spread of the organism.  However, most cases are caused by gram-negative enteric organisms such as E coli. $#Educational objective# Nosocomial bloodstream infections are usually associated with intravascular catheters, which allow skin commensals such as Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci to enter the bloodstream.

  "explanation_2": "#Corynebacterium diphtheriae# are nonmotile, unencapsulated, gram-positive rods.  On microscopic examination, they are often found in clumps (classically said to resemble Chinese characters) or joined in V- or Y-shaped chains.  Their cytoplasm contains metachromatic #granules# that stain with #aniline# dyes (eg, methylene blue). $C diphtheriae produce classic 2-subunit #AB exotoxin#.  The B (binding) subunit binds specifically to the heparin-binding epidermal growth factor receptor on cardiac and neural cells, which explains the toxin's affinity for heart and brain tissue.  The B subunit induces endocytosis of the toxin, and the subsequently released A (active) subunit inhibits host cell protein synthesis by catalyzing the ADP-ribosylation of protein elongation factor 2 (EF-2).  EF-2 is necessary for tRNA to insert new amino acids into the growing protein chain during translation.  Therefore, the toxin causes cell death by inhibiting cell protein synthesis. $#(Choice A)#  Certain virulent enteric bacteria (eg, Campylobacter jejuni, Vibrio cholerae) release AB exotoxins that activate electrolyte transport.  These toxins have 5 B subunits responsible for cell binding and toxin endocytosis and 1 A subunit that stimulates a G protein to increase intracellular cAMP concentrations.  As a result, active efflux of sodium and chloride ions occurs, and the subsequent cell water loss into the gut lumen leads to watery diarrhea and dehydration. $#(Choice B)#  Botulinum toxin is a neurotoxin that blocks exocytosis of acetylcholine-containing presynaptic vesicles from peripheral nerve terminals, causing cranial and peripheral nerve palsies, muscle weakness, and respiratory paralysis.  Tetanus toxin inhibits the release of the inhibitory neurotransmitters gamma-aminobutyric acid and glycine.  Classic manifestations of tetanus include muscle spasms and autonomic hyperactivity. $#(Choice C)#  Clostridium perfringens releases a cytolytic toxin (alpha-toxin, or phospholipase C) that degrades cell membrane phospholipids, causing cell destruction. $#(Choice E)#  Superantigens (eg, staphylococcal and streptococcal toxic shock toxins) bind nonspecifically to T cell receptors and major histocompatibility complex class II molecules on antigen-presenting cells, leading to widespread T cell stimulation and inflammation.  However, they are classically implicated in toxic shock syndrome related to tampon use or nasal packing, not upper respiratory infections. $#Educational objective# Diphtheria exotoxin inhibits host cell protein synthesis by catalyzing the ADP-ribosylation of host cell elongation factor-2.

The most potent endotoxin of gram-negative bacteria is #lipopolysaccharide# (LPS), a heat-stable component in the outer membrane that is released with destruction of the bacterial cell wall or during cell division. $The major virulence component of LPS is #lipid A#, which is located on the inner portion of the molecule and provides an anchor into the cell membrane.  It activates toll-like receptors on innate immune cells (eg, macrophages), triggering the release of endogenous pyrogens (eg, IL-1, IL-6, prostaglandins) and inflammatory mediators (eg, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon).  These cytokines disrupt endothelial cells and increase vascular permeability, resulting in profound hypotension and end-organ dysfunction/failure. $#(Choices A and C)#  Core polysaccharide and O antigen are also components of LPS.  However, core polysaccharide, which contains a short chain of sugars that differs among bacteria, is not involved in the virulence of LPS.  Similarly, O antigen is a variable polysaccharide on the outer surface and is a target for recognition by the host immune system but is not directly responsible for the manifestations of septic shock. $#(Choice D)#  Peptidoglycan is a component of the bacterial cell wall that provides structural integrity and protection from environmental forces (eg, osmotic stress).  Peptidoglycan does not play a role in the development of gram-negative septic shock. $#(Choice E)#  Many gram-negative bacteria (including E coli) have surface lipoproteins (SLPs), or proteins attached to a lipid anchor, projecting from the inner or outer membrane.  These SLPs help move nutrients into the cell and facilitate immune evasion but are not responsible for causing septic shock. $#Educational objective# Pathogenesis of Escherichia coli sepsis involves the release of lipopolysaccharide (ie, endotoxin) from bacterial cells.

L monocytogenes is a motile, #facultatively intracellular# organism with several unique adaptations that allow it to evade the host immune response, including the following: $• #Listeriolysin O#:  This major virulence factor generates #pores in phagosome# membranes, which allows phagocytosed L monocytogenes to #escape into the cytoplasm# of monocytes and avoid lysosomal destruction. $• #Actin#-#based transcellular spread#:  The organism hijacks the actin-based cellular motility mechanism of host cells, which allows it to spread to adjacent cells without reentering the extracellular space.  This significantly reduces exposure of L monocytogenes to antibodies and phagocytic cells. $Because of these adaptations, antibody- and phagocyte-mediated destruction of the pathogen is impaired; therefore, infections are controlled primarily by the cytotoxic T-cell response. $Most L monocytogenes infections occur in #pregnant women# in the third trimester.  Although antibiotics are curative, L monocytogenes quickly invades the placenta and may cause fetal death, premature birth, and neonatal infection. $#(Choice B)#  Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin) is the major component of the cell wall in gram-negative, not gram-positive, bacteria (some sources erroneously report that L monocytogenes contains lipopolysaccharide).  Endotoxin activates complement, coagulation, and fibrinolysis, which can lead to septic shock and disseminated intravascular coagulation. $#(Choice C)#  Clostridium botulinum, an anaerobic gram-positive rod, produces an exotoxin (botulinum toxin) that inhibits the synaptic transmission of motor neurons.  Patients typically develop descending, symmetric motor deficits; minimal sensory changes; and no fever. $#(Choice D)#  Pathogenic strains of Corynebacterium diphtheriae produce an exotoxin that inhibits elongation factor in host cells, which causes pseudomembranous pharyngitis and myocarditis.  Although C diphtheriae is a gram-positive rod, it does not cause febrile gastroenteritis. $#Educational objective# Listeria monocytogenes is a facultative intracellular, gram-positive rod that most often causes febrile gastroenteritis.  Pathogenesis is mediated largely by listeriolysin O, an enzyme that creates pores in phagosomes, which allows the bacteria to escape lysosomal destruction.

  "explanation_2": "$Microscopy of this patient's penis ulcer reveals a #multinucleated giant cell# with ground-glass intranuclear inclusions, raising strong suspicion for #herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection#.  Genital HSV is usually caused by HSV type 2, which is spread primarily via direct skin contact with herpetic sores or infected genital secretions during sexual activity.  Initial infection is often characterized by #painful genital ulcers#, fever, lymphadenopathy, and dysuria.  Symptoms typically resolve within a few weeks, but latent infection develops in the sacral dorsal root ganglia and can periodically reactivate, leading to recurrence. $HSV is generally diagnosed by cell culture or PCR, but #Tzanck smear# (as seen above) can reveal the cytopathic effects of the virus (eg, @multinucleated giant cells@, acantholytic cells, keratinocyte ballooning, nuclear molding).  Oral antiviral agents such as #acyclovir#, a competitive inhibitor of viral DNA polymerase, help speed symptom resolution. $#(Choice B)#  Azithromycin can be used to treat chancroid, which is characterized by the formation of a papule that evolves into a pustule and then an ulcer.  However, it is very rare in the United States and is caused by the gram-negative organism Haemophilus ducreyi; multinucleated giant cells would not be seen. $#(Choice C)#  Doxycycline can treat lymphogranuloma venereum, a genital infection caused by certain serotypes of Chlamydia trachomatis.  This disease is marked by the formation of a small genital ulcer, followed by significant lymph node inflammation and pain in the inguinal or femoral region.  C trachomatis appears as intravacuolar organisms in macrophages. $#(Choice D)#  Fluconazole can treat @Candida@ balanitis, which is typically marked by a painful, pruritic, erythematous rash.  Yeasts and pseudohyphae can often be seen on microscopy. $#(Choice E)#  Penicillin can be used to treat syphilis, a spirochetal infection caused by Treponema pallidum that begins with the formation of a chancre (painless ulcer with heaped-up borders and a clean base) at the site of inoculation.  Diagnosis is generally made with serologic testing because T pallidum cannot be cultured; multiple ulcers and multinucleated giant cells are not typically seen. $#(Choice F)#  Permethrin can be used to treat pubic lice, which are associated with significant pruritus of hairy genital areas.  Lice can generally be visualized on the hair shaft. $#Educational objective# Herpes simplex virus is a common, sexually transmitted infection marked by the formation of painful genital ulcers.

SA residues also inhibit binding of the opsonin C3b (limits opsonophagocytosis) and the generation of the anaphylatoxin C5a (limits immune cell recruitment). $#(Choice A)#  Antigenic variation involves rapid mutation of surface antigens, which limits the ability of immunoglobulin formed during previous infection to prevent future infections.  It is seen primarily with viruses (eg, influenza) and certain bacteria (eg, Neisseria meningitidis); however, GBS is virulent primarily due to SA on its capsule, not antigenic variation. $#(Choice B)#  Catalase-producing organisms (eg, Listeria, Staphylococcus) can break down hydrogen peroxide to oxygen and water, which limits oxidative damage.

Nausea and vomiting are often absent but may occur, and seizure is a severe, uncommon complication that can occur in children.  Stool culture is diagnostic. $#(Choice A)#  Clostridioides difficile infection most commonly causes profuse, watery diarrhea.  This diagnosis is rare without risk factors, such as recent antibiotic use or hospitalization, neither of which is seen in this patient. $#(Choice B)#  Clostridium perfringens gastroenteritis, which typically occurs after ingestion of contaminated food (particularly meat) that was inadequately cooked or refrigerated, causes watery, not bloody, diarrhea. $#(Choice C)#  Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli infection is a common cause of watery diarrhea, particularly in resource-limited countries (travelers' diarrhea).  In contrast, this patient has bloody diarrhea and no travel history outside the United States. $#(Choice D)#  In contrast to nontyphoidal Salmonella gastroenteritis, which can cause bloody diarrhea, Salmonella serovar Typhi infection is most common in resource-limited countries.  It causes fever and bacteremia; abdominal pain with or without diarrhea is common but typically begins a week after initial symptoms.  This patient's acute-onset bloody diarrhea and lack of travel history make this diagnosis unlikely. $#Educational objective# Acute-onset bloody diarrhea is most commonly due to Escherichia coli O157:H7, Shigella, or Campylobacter infection.  Shigella infection also classically causes high fever and left-sided abdominal tenderness (due to rectosigmoid involvement) and often occurs in outbreaks (eg, day care center).  "

It is not known to be effective against HSV-2. $#(Choice D)#  Although condom use may prevent sexual transmission of HSV-2 (and therefore might have prevented this patient from acquiring his primary genital HSV-2 infection), it does not reduce the frequency of recurrence of genital herpes. $#(Choice E)#  A short (7-10 days) course of treatment with oral acyclovir during primary genital HSV infection usually reduces the duration of viral shedding, time for lesional healing, and local pain; however, it does not appear to alter recurrence rates. $#Educational objective# A new-onset genital vesicular rash with a positive Tzanck smear in a previously asymptomatic patient is suggestive of primary genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection due to HSV-2.  Recurrences of genital herpes can be reduced through daily treatment with oral valacyclovir, acyclovir, or famciclovir.  Condom use can help prevent a primary genital HSV infection but does not prevent reactivation of latent infection.  "

  "explanation_2": "#Norovirus# is the most common cause of #viral gastroenteritis#.  Symptoms include diarrhea, #vomiting#, fever, malaise, and headache.  The #diarrhea# is typically #watery without blood or mucus# due to lack of small bowel inflammation. $Norovirus (part of the Calicivirus family) possesses a linear, nonenveloped, single-stranded RNA genome.  It is resistant to inactivation by acid, bile, and pancreatic enzymes.  As a result, norovirus is easily transmitted via #fecal-oral spread# (eg, foodborne, person-to-person via contaminated bodily fluids) and results in #outbreaks# in crowded settings (eg, schools, hospitals, cruise ships, nursing homes).  The incubation period is 1-2 days; symptoms develop acutely and self-resolve within days.  The diagnosis is typically based solely on clinical presentation, but polymerase chain reaction testing may be performed to confirm an outbreak. $#(Choice A)#  Adenoviral gastroenteritis typically presents with fever and watery diarrhea.  Outbreaks can occur, but these are far less common than with norovirus.  Adenovirus more commonly causes pharyngoconjunctivitis and coryza (eg, runny nose, nasal congestion). $#(Choice B)#  Vomiting, high fever, and bloody diarrhea are typical of Campylobacter jejuni enteritis.  Transmission occurs via oral contact with contaminated food (eg, poultry) or drinks.  Outbreaks are not as common as those of viral etiology. $#(Choice C)#  Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile infection can result in asymptomatic carriers, pseudomembranous colitis, or fulminant colitis.  Patients have watery diarrhea with or without blood, abdominal pain, fever, and leukocytosis.  Prior antibiotic exposure (eg, fluoroquinolones, clindamycin) is the most significant risk factor. $#(Choice D)#  Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), the most common cause of traveler's diarrhea, is prevalent in developing countries.  Although the acute onset of nausea, vomiting, and watery nonbloody diarrhea is typical of ETEC infection, it would be unlikely in patients who have not traveled abroad recently. $#(Choice F)#  Gastroenteritis outbreaks can also occur with rotavirus infection, with a presentation similar to that of norovirus.  However, the prevalence of rotavirus in developed countries has decreased dramatically since the introduction of routine childhood vaccination.  Rotavirus is unlikely in vaccinated children (as in this case). $#(Choice G)#  Salmonella typhi infection can result in typhoid fever and presents with fever, followed by abdominal pain and diarrhea and/or constipation.  Severe complications (eg, hepatosplenomegaly, intestinal perforation, sepsis) occur in a minority of patients. $#Educational objective# Norovirus is the most common cause of viral gastroenteritis.

The presence of #oropharyngeal ulcers# and a diffuse #maculopapular rash# are important diagnostic clues. $Acute retroviral syndrome is associated with extremely #high levels of viral replication# (~5 million copies/mL) as the cell-mediated and humoral antibody response against the virus is not yet fully activated.  Therefore, laboratory results during this period usually show evidence of HIV in the plasma (positive viral load and p24 antigen) with a #negative serologic response# (negative HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody).  This is referred to as the \"#window period,#\" as patients are infected with HIV but HIV antibody screening tests may be negative (newer screening tests incorporate testing for HIV p24 antigen and are more sensitive in early infection). $The humoral response to HIV typically develops 6-8 weeks after initial infection.  At this time, anti-HIV antibodies in the serum neutralize circulating virus, which reduces viral load and leads to resolution of acute retroviral symptoms.  Most patients then enter a long asymptomatic period until diminished CD4 counts open the door to opportunistic infections. $#(Choice B)#  Antibodies against HIV surface glycoproteins (eg, gp120) help neutralize circulating virus and reduce viral load.  However, HIV surface glycoproteins display a high degree of antigenic variation, which prevents the formation of a completely effective antibody response. $#(Choices C and E)#  Patients with HIV develop immunosuppression primarily due to impairments in the cell-mediated immune response.  Although the humoral immune response is also impaired, patients are able to generate anti-HIV antibodies that partially neutralize the virus.  It is very rare that a patient with HIV will be too immunodeficient to seroconvert. $#(Choice D)#  Acute retroviral syndrome is marked by an extremely high rate of viral replication.  Although antibodies eventually form, the response is delayed because the humoral immune response takes several weeks to fully develop. $#Educational objective# Initial HIV infection is often associated with mononucleosis-like symptoms (eg, fever, lymphadenopathy, sore throat) 2-4 weeks after transmission.  Important diagnostic clues are oropharyngeal ulcers and a diffuse maculopapular rash.  As the humoral antibody response is not fully activated early in infection, laboratory results typically show HIV in the serum (positive viral load and p24 antigen) but negative HIV serology.  "

  "explanation_2": "This patient developed fever, headache, myalgia, and a maculopapular rash while camping in the Appalachian Mountains, raising strong suspicion for #Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever# (RMSF).  The causative pathogen is #Rickettsia rickettsii#, a weakly gram-negative, obligate intracellular bacterium.  Transmission occurs following a #tick bite# from specific tick vectors (eg, American dog tick) present in the eastern and south-central United States and mountainous regions west of the Mississippi River. $R rickettsii moves from the tick salivary glands to the human host after 6-12 hours of attachment.  The pathogen enters vascular endothelial cells via endocytosis and subsequently lyses the endosome using specific virulence factors.  It then replicates in the cytosol and nucleus of the host cell and spreads rapidly to adjacent cells via filopodia, leading to a lymphohistiocytic #vasculitis#. $Manifestations begin with fever, headache, myalgia, and malaise followed 3-5 days later by a characteristic macular #rash# that becomes petechial over time.  The rash typically begins on the ankles or wrists and spreads toward the center of the body (#centripetally#) as well as to the palms and soles.  #Thrombocytopenia #frequently occurs as platelets are consumed due to widespread vascular injury.  Antibiotic therapy is required to prevent progression and, potentially, death.  First-line therapy is #doxycycline#, which #inhibits protein synthesis# by binding the 30S bacterial ribosomal subunit. $#(Choice A)#  Fluoroquinolones prevent DNA gyrase and topoisomerase from unwinding bacterial double-stranded circular DNA.  Fluoroquinolones can be used to treat typhoid fever, a Salmonella infection that typically occurs in individuals who travel to developing nations.  Symptoms include a step-wise fever, salmon-colored rose spots on the trunk, and intestinal bleeding/perforation. $#(Choice B)#  Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole inhibits bacterial replication by blocking 2 successive steps in bacterial folate metabolism: Sulfamethoxazole competes with para-aminobenzoic acid in the synthesis of dihydrofolic acid, and trimethoprim inhibits dihydrofolate reductase. $#(Choice D)#  Azole medications inhibit fungal ergosterol synthesis, which disrupts fungal cell membranes.  Itraconazole can be used to treat pulmonary histoplasmosis, which usually causes subacute pneumonia with hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy. $#(Choice E)#  Penicillin medications inhibit peptidoglycan cross-linking, which disrupts bacterial (spirochetal) cell membranes.  Penicillin is the first-line therapy for syphilis, a spirochetal infection that can present with fever and a diffuse, symmetric maculopapular rash that involves the palms and soles (secondary syphilis).  However, patients typically have a mild (not high) fever and diffuse lymphadenopathy. $#(Choice F)#  Nucleotide and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors block @viral reverse transcription@.  Although acute retroviral syndrome (early HIV infection) can present with a diffuse maculopapular rash and fever, patients also often have diffuse lymphadenopathy, a sore throat, and painful oral ulcers.  In addition, RMSF is more likely in this case given this patient's recent camping trip. $#Educational objective# Rocky mountain spotted fever is a tick-borne illness due to Rickettsia rickettsii, a weakly gram-negative, obligate intracellular organism that has an affinity for vascular endothelial cells.  Patients usually have nonspecific symptoms (eg, fever, malaise, myalgia) followed by a macular-petechial rash that begins on the ankles and wrists and spreads to the center of the body as well as to the palms and soles.

Although it may be appropriate to perform testing for other sexually transmitted infections, gonorrhea would be an unlikely explanation for this patient's painful genital ulcer. $#(Choice E)#  Granuloma inguinale is characterized by painless, extensive ulcerative lesions, typically without lymphadenopathy. $#(Choice F)#  @Molluscum contagiosum@ is a contagious disease caused by infection with a DNA poxvirus.  Lesions are smooth, skin-colored, firm, somewhat pearly papules that measure about 2-6 mm and often have a central umbilication. $#(Choice G)#  Primary syphilis commonly presents as a characteristically painless single genital ulcer called a chancre.  The diagnosis is established by identification of the organisms on darkfield microscopy, serologic testing, or syphilis antibody testing.  Secondary syphilis is often characterized by systemic symptoms, lymphadenopathy, grey mucous patches, raised grey genital papules (condylomata lata), and a diffuse rash involving the palms and soles. $#(Choice H)# Penile squamous cell cancer can present as lumps or ulcers, sometimes with adenopathy.  However, the lesions are typically painless, and average age at presentation is 50. $#Educational objective# Chancroid, due to Haemophilus ducreyi, presents as deep, painful (you \"do cry\" with H ducreyi) ulcers with ragged borders that are associated with a grey exudate and inguinal lymphadenopathy.

Reductions in mycolic acid availability impair cell wall development, leading to a bactericidal effect.  However, INH is only active once it is processed by mycobacterial catalase-peroxidase.  Therefore, mycobacteria can limit the effect of INH by reducing intracellular levels of catalase-peroxidase.  Other common mechanisms of INH resistance are alteration in the target enzyme binding site and overexpression of the target enzyme. $#(Choice A)#  Ethambutol likely inhibits synthesis of the mycobacterial cell wall.  Resistance develops when the mycobacteria increase production of arabinosyl transferase (an enzyme in the pathway to arabinogalactan, a key constituent of the mycobacterial cell wall). $#(Choice C)#  Because pyrazinamide must be converted to an active form by the mycobacterial enzyme pyrazinamidase, drug resistance can occur when pyrazinamidase is altered or eliminated. $#(Choice D)#  Resistance to rifampin is primarily due to a mutation in the gene that codes for a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase necessary for transcription and RNA elongation. $#(Choice E)#  Streptomycin (used in some patients with tuberculosis) is an aminoglycoside that inhibits mycobacterial protein synthesis by disabling the bacterial ribosomal 30S subunit (which disrupts translation).  Resistance to this drug is primarily achieved by a modification of the 30S ribosomal protein. $#Educational objective# Mycobacterial resistance to isoniazid (INH) is primarily mediated by reductions in the catalase-peroxidase enzyme or through genetic modification of the INH binding site on the mycolic acid synthesis enzyme.

  "explanation_2": "#Streptococcus pneumoniae#, a gram-positive lancet-shaped diplococcus, causes life-threatening invasive infections such as pneumonia and #meningitis# (eg, fever, vomiting, bulging fontanelle).  Its major virulence factor is a #polysaccharide capsule# that protects the bacterium from phagocytosis and opsonization.  Antigenic variation in the polysaccharide capsule differentiates >93 S pneumoniae serotypes.  Immunity against one provides little or no protection against others.  Therefore, infection with a new serotype typically leads to weeks/months of nasopharyngeal colonization and increased risk of invasive infection. $#Vaccination# against the most common and virulent S pneumoniae serotypes is recommended for children and high-risk adults to reduce colonization and invasive disease.  In children, a 13-valent pneumococcal capsular #polysaccharide-conjugate vaccines# (PCV13) is typically administered; this vaccine contains polysaccharides from 13 serotypes conjugated to an #immunogenic carrier protein# (nontoxic recombinant diphtheria toxin) to improve immunogenicity. $Although vaccination creates protective antibodies against included polysaccharide antigens, it provides little or no protection against strains not in the vaccine; therefore, invasive disease with a #nonvaccinated serotype# can still occur. $#(Choice A)#  Antigenic variation in the bacterial cell wall can lead to short-lived immunity against certain bacteria (eg, Neisseria gonorrhoeae).  In contrast, S pneumoniae antigenic variation occurs primarily on the polysaccharide capsule, not the cell wall. $#(Choice B)#  Some S pneumoniae strains have no polysaccharide capsule; these strains are minimally virulent and rarely cause invasive disease. $#(Choice D)#  T-cell immunodeficiency would likely increase the risk for poor response to vaccinations.  However, primary T-cell immunodeficiency is quite rare and typically presents with recurrent upper respiratory infections.  This patient is far more likely to be infected with a strain not in the vaccine. $#(Choice E)#  The 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) contains capsular polysaccharide antigens with @no protein conjugate@; therefore, it elicits a T-cell–independent response and is not immunogenic enough to be used in individuals age <2.  PPSV23 is reserved primarily for high-risk adults. $#Educational objective# Streptococcus pneumoniae is virulent primarily due to a polysaccharide capsule.  A conjugant vaccine provides long-lasting immunity against serotypes in the vaccine but provides no significant immunity against nonvaccinated serotypes.
