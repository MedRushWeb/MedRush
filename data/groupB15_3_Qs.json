For example, the probability of @rolling a die@ and getting a 1 is 1/6, but the odds of rolling a 1 is 1/5.  The #odds ratio (OR)# is a measure of association used in case-control studies to compare the #odds of exposure# in #cases# (ie, individuals with disease) relative to #controls# (ie, individuals without disease): $    #OR# = (odds of exposure in cases) / (odds of exposure in controls) $A shortcut to calculate the OR when a contingency table has a @standard format@ (ie, exposure of interest in the first row of exposure status and cases in the first column of disease status) is the following: $    #OR# = (a/c) / (b/d) $In this study, the #disease# of interest is #systemic lupus erythematosus# (SLE), so cases are women with SLE, and controls are women without SLE.  The #exposure# of interest is a #history of endometriosis#.  Given that 240 of 1,040 women with SLE had a history of endometriosis, 1,040 − 240 = 800 of women with SLE had no history of endometriosis.  Given that 210 of 1,260 without SLE had a history of endometriosis, 1,260 − 210 = 1,050 of women without SLE had no history of endometriosis.  Based on these data, the standard contingency table is as follows: ","explanation_2":"The odds of endometriosis in women with SLE and women without SLE are: $• Odds of endometriosis in cases: a/c = 240/800 = 0.3  $• #Odds# of endometriosis in #controls#: b/d = 210/1,050 = 0.2 $Therefore, the OR of endometriosis in women with SLE compared to women without SLE is: $• #OR# = (odds of endometriosis in cases) / (odds of endometriosis in controls) = (a/c) / (b/d) = 0.3/0.2 = #1.5# $The estimated #OR = 1.5# is >1 (ie, the null value for the OR); this indicates that a history of endometriosis acts as a #risk factor# for SLE. $This example calculated the OR of exposure (ie, odds of exposure among cases relative to controls).  The OR is sometimes described as the odds of disease among exposed individuals relative to nonexposed individuals, given by (a/b) / (c/d).  Both OR definitions are mathematically equivalent and reduce to OR = (ad) / (bc). $#Educational objective# The odds ratio (OR) is a measure of association calculated as: OR = (odds of exposure in cases) / (odds of exposure in controls).  For a contingency table in the standard format: OR = (ad) / (bc). ","clickable_1":"images/img1.19810.jpg","clickable_2":"images/img2.19810.jpg"}
