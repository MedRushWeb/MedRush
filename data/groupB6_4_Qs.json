Warfarin inhibits the vitamin K dependent g-carboxylation of the glutamic acid residues of clotting factors II, VII, IX and X, causing production of dysfunctional coagulation proteins. $The therapeutic effect of warfarin is monitored by measuring the prothrombin time (PT).  The international normalized ratio (INR) is a standardized PT.  The target INR for therapeutic warfarin anticoagulation is 2-3.   Bleeding is a common complication of warfarin therapy and the risk is increased with INRs above 3.0.  Treatment of life-threatening bleeding requires rapid reversal using fresh frozen plasma.  Vitamin K can help to reverse warfarin action, but the effects take time. $#(Choice B)#  Protamine is used for heparin reversal.  It acts by binding and chemically inactivating heparin. $#(Choice C)#  Aminocaproic acid is an antifibrinolytic agent that inhibits plasminogen activators and, to a lesser degree, antiplasmin activity.  Aminocaproic acid helps achieve hemostasis when fibrinolysis is the cause of bleeding. $#(Choice E)#  Whereas fresh frozen plasma contains all of the coagulation factors, cryoprecipitate contains only cold-soluble proteins (Factor VIII, fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, and vitronectin). $#(Choice F)#  Desmopressin is a synthetic analogue of anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) used in the treatment of diabetes insipidus.  At high doses, desmopressin increases factor VIII activity in patients with hemophilia A and von Willebrand disease.  High-dose desmopressin can help control bleeding associated with these disorders. $#Educational objective# Both vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma are used for reversing warfarin-induced anticoagulation.  Fresh frozen plasma rapidly reverses warfarin's effects whereas vitamin K requires time for clotting factor re-synthesis.  "},

Colonic, mucosal, and cutaneous bleeding is common in patients with severe AS due to #acquired von Willebrand syndrome#. $Von Willebrand factor (vWF) is a multimeric glycoprotein generated by endothelial cells and platelets.  It plays 3 important roles in hemostasis: $• vWF binds to sites of endothelial injury and serves as a scaffold for platelet aggregation. $• vWF promotes platelet aggregation at sites of high shearing pressure (often seen in areas of endothelial injury). $• vWF acts as a carrier protein for factor VIII, which dramatically reduces the metabolism of factor VIII. $The activity of vWF is greatest when it is in large, multimeric forms.  However, large multimers of vWF are also most susceptible to unfolding in areas of #high shear forces#, exposing a cleavage site that makes them more vulnerable to destruction by the ADAMTS13 metalloproteinase.

Her laboratory results show a consumptive coagulopathy (thrombocytopenia, prolonged PT/PTT, low fibrinogen), which, along with bleeding from the central catheter site, are likely due to #disseminated intravascular coagulation# (DIC). $ DIC is a common complication of #sepsis# (particularly with gram-negative organisms) because #lipopolysaccharide# is a #procoagulant#that triggers the coagulation cascade.  This leads to the formation of fibrin- and platelet-rich thrombi in the vasculature, which consumes platelets #(thrombocytopenia)#, coagulation factors #(prolonged PT/PTT)#, and fibrinogen.  Fibrinolysis is then triggered to degrade the clots, which #elevates D-dimer# (a fibrin degradation product) and depletes protein C, protein S, and antithrombin.

Although patients often have prolonged PTT (because the antiphospholipid interferes with the PTT test), PT is normal. $ (Choice B)  Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is caused by reduced activity of von Willebrand factor–cleaving protein ADAMTS13, leading to the accumulation of ultra-large von Willebrand factor multimers that trap platelets and generate platelet-rich thrombi in the microvasculature.  Although patients usually develop thrombocytopenia, MAHA, fever, confusion, and organ damage (eg, acute renal failure), the coagulation cascade is unaffected; therefore, PT/PTT and fibrinolysis (fibrinogen level) are normal, and bleeding does not occur. $ (Choice D)  Immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is marked by autoantibodies to platelets/megakaryocytes; thrombocytopenia is the only peripheral blood abnormality.

Because t-PA can only bind plasminogen strongly in the presence of fibrin, its thrombolytic action is clot specific. $#(Choice D)#  Protein C and protein S are endogenous antithrombotic molecules that are also vitamin K-dependent.

Because the effect of warfarin is significantly altered by certain foods and medications, patients on long-term warfarin are at risk for subtherapeutic or #supratherapeutic INR# due to any of the following: $• Change in dietary vitamin K intake: Increase in dietary vitamin K increases the availability of vitamin K in the liver, which counters the inhibitory effect of warfarin on epoxide reductase.  Therefore, patients on warfarin are advised to eat a consistent amount of vitamin K–containing foods (eg, leafy greens, brussels sprouts). $• #Disruption to intestinal flora:# Intestinal flora produce vitamin K as a byproduct of metabolism.  Therefore, antibiotics that target gram-negative bacteria such as metronidazole, macrolides, and fluroquinolones can cause supratherapeutic INR due to destruction of vitamin K–producing bacteria in the gut.

As a result, warfarin administration leads to prolongation of the prothrombin time (PT) and INR (ratio of a patient's PT compared to a normal control).  In patients with atrial fibrillation, deep venous thrombosis, or PE who are taking warfarin for anticoagulation, the dose is usually adjusted to achieve a target therapeutic INR range (generally 2.0-3.0). $Precise dosing of warfarin can be difficult due to its many interactions with other drugs that affect cytochrome P-450 activity, plasma protein binding, and/or gastrointestinal absorption.  Warfarin elimination occurs primarily through hepatic metabolism by cytochrome P-450 enzymes.  Drugs that #increase P-450 activity#, such as #phenytoin#, phenobarbital, and rifampin, #increase warfarin elimination# and decrease its anticoagulant activity (reflected as a subtherapeutic INR <2.0).

Inherited causes of hypercoagulability must be considered in all patients under age 50 who present with thromboses in the absence of any obvious explanation for an acquired prothrombotic state. $ The patient's plasma is resistant to the normally antithrombotic effects of activated protein C.  Thus, the most likely diagnosis is a mutation in the factor V gene, which renders factor Va resistant to inactivation by activated protein C.  A specific factor V mutation, known as the Leiden mutation, and mutations in the prothrombin gene are the most common inherited causes of hypercoagulability.  Activated protein C resistance (factor V Leiden mutation) is detected in approximately 20% (range 12–40%) of patients with abnormal venous thromboses. $ (Choice A) Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is a common immune cause of hypercoagulability.  This condition is defined by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (lupus anticoagulant and/or anticardiolipin antibodies) plus one or more of the following: venous thromboembolism, arterial thromboembolism, or frequent fetal loss.  Unlike the patient in the vignette, patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome typically have a prolonged baseline aPTT.  Lupus anticoagulants are the most common cause of aPTT prolongation. $ (Choice B) Folic acid deficiency can cause hyperhomocysteinemia, which is a prothrombotic state.  However, activated protein C resistance is not seen with this condition. $ (Choice D) Endovascular infections and/or systemic inflammatory states may affect vascular endothelial cells in a way that favors thrombosis.  However, infection and inflammatory mediators do not directly promote activated protein C resistance in the aPTT coagulation test. $ (Choice E) A paraneoplastic syndrome of hypercoagulability may be seen in some patients with cancer, especially patients with adenocarcinomas of the pancreas, colon, or lung.  The mechanism of cancer-induced hypercoagulability is thought to involve release of procoagulant tumor products.  Vascular stasis due to obstruction of blood flow by the tumor, patient immobility, hepatic involvement and dysfunction, sepsis, and advanced age may also contribute to the tendency toward thrombosis in cancer patients.  None of these mechanisms/factors directly promotes activated protein C resistance in the aPTT coagulation test. $ Educational Objective Inherited causes of hypercoagulability should be considered in patients younger than age 50 who present with thrombosis and no obvious explanation for an acquired prothrombotic state.
