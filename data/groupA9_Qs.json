It is a major cause of infectious diarrhea in children worldwide and typically presents in those #age <5# with acute, self-limited fever and #watery diarrhea# that may lead to #dehydration #and electrolyte abnormalities.  Rotavirus vaccination is protective and has resulted in a dramatic reduction in disease incidence. $Rotavirus invades the villous epithelium of the #duodenum and proximal jejunum#.  Infection causes diarrhea via multiple mechanisms including #villous blunting# (loss of absorptive capacity), proliferation of secretory crypt cells (secretory diarrhea), and reduced brush border enzymes (accumulation of unmetabolized disaccharides in the small intestine lumen).  Rotavirus-induced diarrhea is noninflammatory; therefore, fecal leukocytes and erythrocytes are not typically seen.  Repeat infections are often less severe than initial infection due to the generation of protective secretory IgA against rotaviral antigens. $#(Choice B)#  Clostridioides difficile infection causes exotoxin-mediated damage to the large intestine mucosa, leading to the development of @yellow-white pseudomembranes@.  Cases are most common after recent antibiotic therapy and usually present with watery diarrhea, fever, and abdominal pain.  C difficile is a spore-forming, gram-positive bacterium. $#(Choice C)#  Entamoeba histolytica is an anaerobic parasite that commonly causes dysentery and extraintestinal disease (eg, liver abscess) in the developing world.  Gastrointestinal infection usually results in bloody stools and fever; colonic visualization classically reveals flask-shaped ulcers (ie, with overhanging edges) in the cecum and ascending colon. $#(Choice D)#  @Whipple disease@ is caused by the gram-positive bacillus Tropheryma whipplei.  Histopathology of the small intestine classically shows foamy macrophages in the lamina propria.  Manifestations usually include arthralgias and chronic diarrhea with malabsorption and weight loss. $#(Choice E)#  Typhoid strains of Salmonella pass through enterocytes and invade macrophages in the intestinal submucosa and Peyer patches.  Inflammation and necrosis of Peyer patches can lead to life-threatening gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation. $#Educational objective# Rotavirus is a common cause of self-limited childhood diarrhea in unvaccinated individuals.  It infects villous enterocytes in the duodenum and proximal jejunum and results in villous blunting, proliferation of secretory crypt cells, and a loss of brush border enzymes; this results in watery diarrhea without fecal leukocytes.

  "explanation_2": "Many strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae have pili, hair-like protein polymers projecting from the bacterial surface that are involved in organism attachment to mucosal surfaces.  When the host produces antibodies against gonococcal pili, mucosal adherence is inhibited.  At a given time, only 1 pilus gene is functional, so only 1 pilus type is expressed.  However, the structural genes for pilus proteins undergo #antigenic variation# at a high frequency; they undergo #recombination# with each other to produce new antigenic types of pili.  The number of possible antigenic pilus types is theoretically quite large.  This diversity is a reason that vaccine development against N gonorrhoeae pili has been challenging. $#(Choice A)#  Antigenic mimicry is the sharing of antigenic sequences between the microorganism and the host cell, facilitating immune evasion.  The gonococcal lipooligosaccharide is similar in structure to human cell membrane glycosphingolipids.  However, this is not related to antibody formation against the pilus.  Antigenic mimicry can lead to autoimmune disease if the host mounts an immune response against the infectious epitope and that epitope has sufficient sequence homology with a host antigen. $#(Choice C)#  Plasmid conjugation plays an important role in gonococcal antibiotic resistance. $#(Choice D)#  Pilin proteins do not represent a low molecular weight structure that would be poorly immunogenic. $#(Choice E)#  Gonococcal pili are protein polymers.  In addition, vaccines have been developed against non-protein structures (eg, meningococcal vaccine, pneumococcal vaccine). $#Educational objective# Gonococci use their pili to mediate adherence to the mucosal epithelium.  Through antigenic variation, each gonococcus can modify the pilus protein expressed, thereby avoiding host defenses (to some degree) and making vaccination directed against the pilus protein difficult.

  "explanation_2": "#Neonatal tetanus# (tetanus neonatorum) is a major cause of infant mortality in developing countries but is rare in the United States.  It occurs when Clostridium tetani spores are introduced to the neonate, generally from #unhygienic delivery# or cord care.  Symptoms typically begin #5-7 days after birth# and can progress more rapidly than in adults.  Infected neonates become irritable and have difficulty feeding/suckling due to tonic spasm of the masticatory muscles (trismus).  As the disease progresses, #spasms and hypertonicity# become more generalized.  Mortality approaches 100% without treatment. $Prevention of neonatal tetanus is achieved primarily by #vaccination# of the mother #during pregnancy# with an inactivated tetanus toxin (tetanus toxoid) as part of the tetanus-diptheria (Td) or tetanus-reduced diphteria-acellular pertussus (Tdap) vaccine.  An appropriately vaccinated woman provides #transplacental IgG# to the fetus, which decreases the incidence of neonatal tetanus by approximately 95%. $#(Choice A)#  Secretory IgA found in breast milk helps prevent respiratory and gastrointestinal infections in the neonate by providing mucosal immune support.  However, adequate protection against neonatal tetanus requires the presence of toxin-neutralizing, circulating IgG antibodies that are obtained transplacentally. $#(Choices B and C)#  Treatment of tetanus, including neonatal tetanus, involves the use of antibiotics to kill C tetani and administration of tetanus immunoglobulin to neutralize unbound toxins.  However, these agents are not used for tetanus prevention. $#(Choice E)#  The tetanus vaccine is not given at birth because the neonatal immune system is immature and unable to mount a proper memory immune response against the tetanus toxoid.  The first dose of the Tdap series is commonly administered at age 2 months. $#Educational objective# Risk for neonatal tetanus is reduced substantially by hygienic umbilical cord care and vaccination of the mother during pregnancy.  Mothers who have been vaccinated provide passive immunity to the fetus via transplacental IgG, which protects the neonate until active immunization (vaccination) at approximately age 2 months.  "

Infants born to HBeAg-positive women (as in this case) have a >90% chance of acquiring infection, whereas the chance is less in infants born to HBeAg-negative women. $Viral replication occurs rapidly in infected infants due to immune system immaturity in newborns.

The chance of progression to chronic hepatitis B is 90% without treatment, much higher than the chance of progression in older children and adults.  Administration of #hepatitis B vaccine# and #immunoglobulin# as soon as possible after delivery can prevent chronic infection. $#(Choice A)#  Due to their immature immune system, more than 90% of vertically infected infants develop chronic infection (eg, they do not develop anti-HBs and do not clear their HBV infection).  Additionally, the infant's mother has chronic disease and lacks anti-HBs, meaning there would be no maternally derived transplacental antibodies.  Therefore, anti-HBs would not be expected in this infant. $#(Choices C and D)#  Hepatic injury from hepatitis B is due to the cellular immune response, not by the virus itself.  Therefore, infants with HBV infection enter an immune-tolerant phase due to their immature T-cell responses, which limits hepatocyte damage.  As a result, laboratory markers of liver injury (eg, liver function tests, direct bilirubinemia) are usually normal or only mildly elevated in HBV-infected neonates. $#(Choice E)#  Perinatally infected infants have rapid appearance of HBsAg within a few days; absence of both HBsAg and anti-HBs at age 2 months would suggest that the infant was not infected.  However, this is unlikely as virtually all infants born to HBeAg-positive mothers will be infected perinatally. $#Educational objective# Infants born to HBeAg-positive mothers have a high risk of acquiring perinatal hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.

The major reservoir for this organism is domesticated cats, and transmission to humans primarily occurs after a #cat scratch# or bite.  Patients with intact immunity who are exposed to B henselae often develop cat-scratch disease (regional lymphadenopathy), but those with #advanced AIDS# are at risk for the more severe clinical syndrome of BA. $Patients with BA develop #violaceous#, #cutaneous lesions# that are highly vascular.  Lesions form over weeks or months and are typically associated with fever, weight loss, and other constitutional symptoms.  As these lesions are similar to those seen in @Kaposi sarcoma@, tissue testing for human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) is typically performed (HHV-8 testing will be positive in Kaposi sarcoma and negative in BA).  Biopsy with histopathology confirms the diagnosis and usually reveals @large endothelial cells@ forming #small vascular channels# surrounded by a mixed inflammatory infiltrate.

The infection is not invasive and does not disseminate outside of the gastrointestinal tract.  However, the elaboration of the cholera enterotoxin leads to #severe, watery diarrhea# that can cause death from electrolyte imbalance and dehydration within 12 hours of symptom onset.  Cholera is endemic in southern Asia and parts of Africa and Latin America, where seasonal outbreaks are common (peaks occur prior to and after rainy seasons).  In the United States, the disease is rare and occurs mainly in patients who ingest contaminated seafood from the Gulf Coast. $V cholerae must survive the acidic environment of the stomach to reach the small intestine and cause disease.

Isoniazid resistance specifically occurs by two selective gene mutations.  The first is a decrease in bacterial expression of the catalase-peroxidase enzyme that is required for isoniazid activation once the drug enters the bacterial cell.  The second mechanism of resistance occurs through modification of the protein target binding site for isoniazid.  Treatment of active tuberculosis is accomplished by combining multiple antibiotics to avoid selecting for resistant strains.  Commonly used drug regimens include isoniazid and rifampin in addition to streptomycin, ethambutol, and/or pyrazinamide. $Isoniazid monotherapy may be used for patients who have a positive PPD and a negative chest x-ray (i.e., no evidence of clinical disease). $#(Choice A)#  For isoniazid monotherapy to result in the selective survival of intracellular bacilli would suggest that isoniazid is unable to penetrate into (or is otherwise degraded by) macrophages that house M. tuberculosis.  However, this is not the case.  Isoniazid can reach therapeutic levels within macrophages, areas of caseous necrosis, and cerebrospinal fluid. $#(Choice B)#  Decreased transport protein expression at the cell surface would interfere with the effectiveness of drugs that require protein-mediated transport into the bacterial cell to reach the intended target (eg, fluoroquinolones, macrolides, aminoglycosides). $#(Choice C)#  β-lactamase induction within bacterial cells would not result from isoniazid exposure because isoniazid is not a beta-lactam antibiotic. $#(Choice D)#  Rapid mycobacterial elimination from the body occurs when a small inoculum is recognized and quickly destroyed by the cell-mediated immune system.  This happens in the majority of exposures.  By the time tuberculosis has progressed to active, symptomatic disease, large caseous and liquefactive necrotic granulomas have usually formed and a lengthy treatment period with appropriate multidrug therapy is required to eradicate the organism.  Antibiotic therapy for tuberculosis lasts a minimum of six months. $#Educational objective# Active tuberculosis is never treated with drug monotherapy due to the fast emergence of mycobacterial antibiotic resistance from rapid, selective gene mutations.

A history of meningococcal vaccination does not preclude the need for antibiotic chemoprophylaxis. $Of the listed agents, #rifampin# is the only effective choice.  Rifampin penetrates well into all body compartments, including the upper respiratory tract, and will eliminate nasopharyngeal colonization.  Other effective agents include ciprofloxacin (not routinely used in children due to concerns about connective tissue injury) and intramuscular ceftriaxone, which is effective but not widely used due to the painful mode of administration.  Chemoprophylaxis should be given as soon as possible, preferably within 24 hours of diagnosis. $#(Choice A)#  Vaccination is an important public health strategy for control of meningococcal disease in general, but does not play a role in post-exposure prophylaxis.  Immunity following a post-exposure vaccination does not occur in time to prevent disease. $#(Choice B)#  A person's risk for infection is 500-1,000 times greater following an exposure to a meningococcal disease patient, and disease onset can be rapid.  Therefore, observation alone is not an appropriate strategy for exposed close contacts. $#(Choice C)#  Although penicillin can be used for treatment of susceptible meningococcal infections, it has not been shown to eliminate nasal carriage or prevent secondary cases.  Therefore, it should not be used for chemoprophylaxis. $#(Choice E)#  Sulfamethoxazole was the first agent to be used as chemoprophylaxis for meningococcal disease.  However, it is no longer an effective agent due to widespread resistance. $#Educational objective# Rifampin is the most frequently used agent for chemoprophylaxis of meningococcal disease.

It is characterized by the triad of renal insufficiency, thrombocytopenia, and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia.  Most cases occur due to underlying #enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli# (EHEC) infection, particularly with the O157:H7 serotype. $EHEC is a gram-negative, enteric rod that acquires the ability to produce #Shiga toxin# from a lysogenic bacteriophage.  Shiga toxin enters the cytosol of host cells and cleaves a protein motif off the 60S ribosomal subunit, which irreversibly halts host protein synthesis and causes cell death.  Toxin-mediated injury to the colonic mucosa and the colonic capillaries causes abdominal pain and #bloody diarrhea#.  The absorption of Shiga toxin into the systemic circulation causes glomerular (renal insufficiency) and vascular (thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia) injury in a minority of patients, leading to HUS. $The primary reservoir for EHEC is the gastrointestinal tract of healthy cattle.  Humans primarily acquire the organism after consuming contaminated, #undercooked beef#.  Because low infectious doses (10-100 organisms) are required for disease, meatpacking facilities that process high volumes of ground beef are an important source of outbreaks.  Other less common routes of transmission include person-to-person contact and fruits and vegetables contaminated with manure. $#(Choice A)#  Canned foods that are contaminated with Clostridium botulinum can be associated with foodborne illness due to the consumption of preformed botulism toxin.  Patients typically develop descending, symmetric paralysis. $#(Choices B and D)#  The consumption of preformed, heat-stable Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin causes self-limited nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramping 1-6 hours after ingestion.  Dairy (eg, custard), produce, meats, eggs (eg, mayonnaise), and salads are common culprits and are usually inoculated during preparation by a food handler. $#(Choice C)#  Bacillus cereus enterotoxin is classically associated with reheated rice.  It causes a vomiting-predominant, foodborne illness that clinically resembles the illness seen with S aureus enterotoxin. $#(Choice E)#  Consumption of raw oysters can lead to infection with Vibrio parahaemolyticus (which causes voluminous watery diarrhea similar to cholera) and Vibrio vulnificus (which causes sepsis with high mortality), as well as other Vibrio infections. $#(Choice F)#  The consumption of raw eggs or incompletely cooked poultry can lead to Salmonella gastroenteritis, which usually causes watery diarrhea, abdominal cramping, vomiting, and fever. $#Educational objective# Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) is primarily contracted after eating undercooked ground beef.  EHEC produces Shiga toxin, which causes hemorrhagic colitis and can lead to hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS).

The genitourinary tract (eg, cystoscopy) is the most common portal of entry; gastrointestinal (eg, colonoscopy) or obstetric procedures are also risk factors.  Enterococci can also cause urinary tract infections (most common), intraabdominal and pelvic infections, and wound infections.  Enterococci are typically gamma-hemolytic (no hemolysis on agar), #catalase-negative#, pyrrolidonyl arylamidase-positive, Lancefield Group D #gram-positive cocci# that can grow in #hypertonic (6.5%) saline and bile#.  The most common species of enterococci (formerly classified under the genus Streptococcus) are Enterococcus faecalis (80%-90%) and Enterococcus faecium (10%-15%). $Enterococci are resistant to many antibiotics and can be very difficult to treat.  A cell wall-active agent (such as ampicillin) is often combined with an aminoglycoside for synergistic effect, but increasingly bacteria resistant to both aminoglycosides and β-lactams (including penicillinase-resistant types) are emerging.  Strains with vancomycin or linezolid resistance have also appeared. $#(Choice B)#  Dental extraction is associated with endocarditis caused by viridans group streptococci (VGS).  In most cases, VGS cause subacute bacterial endocarditis in already abnormal heart valves (eg, congenital valvular abnormalities, valves damaged by rheumatic fever).  VGS do not grow on hypertonic saline.  In addition, almost all VGS species do not grow on bile (VGS are also considered bile-insoluble as they exhibit no cell lysis in the presence of bile, in contrast to the bile-soluble S pneumoniae). $#(Choice C)#  Removal of a nasal polyp can cause transient bacteremia.  Organisms that colonize the nose include Corynebacterium species, Haemophilus species, staphylococci, streptococci, and Neisseria species.  Of these, staphylococci and streptococci may cause endocarditis, but the organism described displays characteristics of Enterococcus. $#(Choice D)#  Sinus infections are usually caused by S pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis.  S pneumoniae would be a very rare cause of endocarditis and is usually identified by being bile-soluble and optochin-sensitive. $#(Choice E)#  Skin biopsy is a benign procedure that would be unlikely to cause endocarditis.  Skin is colonized with many bacteria, including Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species, Corynebacterium species, and Bacillus species. $#Educational objective# Enterococcus is a component of the normal colonic and urogenital flora and is capable of growing in hypertonic saline and bile.

This allows the virus to rapidly accumulate mutations (~1 nucleotide base pair per replication cycle) that may make it resistant to antiretroviral monotherapy.

  "explanation_2": "#Leptospirosis# is a widespread, zoonotic infection caused by several species of Leptospira, a thin, highly coiled, #motile spirochete# that infects wild (eg, rodents) and domestic (eg, dogs, cattle) animals.  Infected animals harbor the organism in the proximal renal tubule and excrete it in urine.  Transmission to humans primarily occurs during outdoor recreational (eg, kayaking, freshwater swimming) or occupational activities that exposes them to #water contaminated with animal urine#. $Most cases of leptospirosis are mild or subclinical.  However, some patients develop a #flu-like illness# (eg, fever, rigors, myalgia, headache), lymphadenopathy, or more severe end-organ disease such as renal failure or hepatic failure (eg, jaundice, hepatomegaly).  #Conjunctival suffusion#, redness of the conjunctiva that resembles conjunctivitis but is noninflammatory, is an important diagnostic clue.  Because spirochetes do not grow well on traditional culture media, initial blood cultures are often negative.  However, specialized culture media can often identify the #corkscrew-shaped organism#. $#(Choice A)#  Bats can transmit rabies to humans via a bite wound.  Manifestations typically begin with flulike symptoms and progress to fever, hydrophobia, pharyngeal spasms, coma, and death.  Rabies is a cylindrical, enveloped RNA virus; it is not a motile, corkscrew-shaped organism. $#(Choice B)#  Yersinia, a bacteria transmitted by animal (eg, rodent) fleas, can cause bubonic plague, which typically presents with sudden-onset, flulike symptoms followed by intense pain and regional lymphadenopathy (eg, inguinal).  Yersinia grows well on traditional culture media; it appears on Gram stain as a gram-negative coccobacillus. $#(Choice D)#  Lyme disease is a spirochetal, tick-borne illness that can cause chronic arthritis and neurologic manifestations (eg, meningitis, neuropathy); prominent hepatic dysfunction (eg, jaundice) and acute renal failure would not be expected.  Rocky Mountain spotted fever is another tickborne illness that can present with flulike symptoms and conjunctivitis, however, it is caused by the gram-negative bacterium Rickettsia rickettsii (not a corkscrew-shaped spirochete). $#(Choice E)#  Tularemia is caused by the gram-negative bacterium Francisella tularensis, which frequently infects rabbits.  Manifestations typically include flulike symptoms followed by lymphadenopathy and a papulo-ulcerative eschar at the site of inoculation. $#Educational objective# Leptospirosis is a zoonotic infection caused by the motile spirochete Leptospira.  Transmission primarily occurs when humans come into contact with water contaminated with animal urine during outdoor recreational or occupational activities.  Patients classically have a mild, self-limited, flulike illness but may develop more serious complications such as renal or hepatic failure.  "

The condition is often polymicrobial, but monomicrobial infection can occur with #Streptococcus pyogenes#, Staphylococcus aureus, and Clostridium perfringens.  @S pyogenes@ (group A Streptococcus) is a gram-positive cocci that is coagulase negative, catalase negative, and pyrrolidonyl arylamidase (#PYR#) #positive#.  It also forms small colonies with a wide zone of beta-hemolysis and is sensitive to bacitracin, which has been widely replaced by the PYR test. $S pyogenes can be transmitted through wounds and spreads rapidly to the deep layers of the skin and fascia due to production of #hyaluronidase# and #streptokinase# (converts plasminogen to plasmin).  M protein is expressed on the surface and allows the bacteria to evade phagocytosis by preventing activation of the alternative complement pathway.  The bacterium also secretes hemolysins O and S (cytotoxins that cause hemolysis) and pyrogenic exotoxins (superantigens that result in tissue injury and septic shock). $Sudden-onset, #severe pain# and swelling are typically present at a site of trauma or recent surgery.  Patients quickly become #hypotensive# and develop septic shock.  Necrotizing fasciitis is treated with #aggressive surgical debridement# of all necrotic tissue plus empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics due to the high incidence of polymicrobial infection. $#(Choice A)#  A hydrophila is an oxidase-positive, non–lactose-fermenting, gram-negative rod.  It can cause gastroenteritis, wound infections, and bacteremia following exposure to contaminated water. $#(Choice B)#  C perfringens is a large, spore-forming, anaerobic, gram-positive rod that is catalase and coagulase negative.  It is implicated in food poisoning, clostridial myonecrosis (gas gangrene), and bacteremia.  On blood agar, it produces a double zone of beta-hemolysis. $#(Choice C)#  S aureus is a gram-positive coccus that grows in clusters.  It is catalase positive, coagulase positive, and PYR negative.  S aureus produces large colonies and demonstrates beta-hemolysis.  Like S pyogenes, S aureus can also cause monomicrobial necrotizing fasciitis. $#(Choice D)#  S agalactiae (group B Streptococcus) is a coagulase- and catalase-negative, PYR negative, gram-positive coccus that grows in chains.  Colonies produce a narrow zone of beta-hemolysis that enhances when plated perpendicular to S aureus (positive CAMP test).  S agalactiae can cause skin and soft tissue infections, as well as newborn sepsis and meningitis. $#Educational objective# Necrotizing fasciitis is a severe infection of the subcutaneous tissue and deep fascia and is a surgical emergency.  The infection is often polymicrobial, but monomicrobial cases due to Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus) can also occur.  S pyogenes is a PYR-positive, beta-hemolytic, gram-positive coccus that grows in chains.  ",

  "explanation_2": "This patient recently traveled to South America and now has several manifestations of #dengue#, a Flavivirus infection transmitted by female Aedes mosquitoes.  Although primary (first) infections can be asymptomatic, adult patients may develop high fever, retroorbital pain, and severe myalgia/arthralgia, which gives dengue its common name #breakbone fever#.  Hemorrhagic symptoms (eg, epistaxis, petechiae/purpura) can also occur, and laboratory evaluation often shows leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated transaminases.  Most primary infections #resolve spontaneously# within 3-5 days and lead to lifelong protective immunity against the infecting viral serotype. $However, there are 4 dengue virus serotypes, and #secondary# infection with a #different viral serotype# is common and is usually associated with #more severe illness#.  Secondary infections are particularly likely to cause #dengue shock syndrome#, a life-threatening dysregulation marked by increased capillary permeability, circulatory collapse (eg, shock), and end-organ damage (eg, #stupor#). $Although the exact pathogenesis of dengue shock syndrome remains unclear, it is probably due to the formation of nonneutralizing, #cross-reactive antibodies# during primary infection that then trigger antibody-dependent #enhancement of secondary infection#.  There may also be accelerated (not blunted) T-lymphocyte activity against secondary infection due to display of cross-reacting viral antigens on major histocompatibility complexes of infected cells #(choice B).# $#(Choice A)#  Antigenic drift is a minor change in viral structure that makes neutralizing antibodies formed during previous infection less effective.  This can increase the risk of reinfection and lead to outbreaks.  Antigenic drift is frequently seen with the influenza virus, but is not prominent with the dengue virus. $#(Choice D)#  Dengue virus inoculation size is not strongly correlated with severity of illness compared to many other viral infections (eg, influenza, hepatitis B). $#(Choice E)#  Viral superinfection can occur when hepatitis D virus infects a patient with active hepatitis B virus infection.  Although superinfection can cause severe hepatitis (eg, elevated transaminases, systemic symptoms, high fever), the presence of the shock syndrome and hemorrhagic manifestations shortly after travel to South America makes dengue more likely.  Hepatitis D is uncommon in the western hemisphere unless patients are in a high-risk category (eg, injection drug user). $#Educational objective# There are 4 different serotypes of dengue virus.  Repeat infection occurs when a person is exposed to a serotype not previously encountered.  Secondary infections are often far more severe than primary infections and may be associated with a life-threatening shock syndrome.  "

  "explanation_2": "$This patient's pulmonary/gastrointestinal symptoms, eosinophilia, and larvae on pulmonary sample indicate #strongyloidiasis#, a helminth infection endemic to #Southeast Asia# (eg, Myanmar), #Africa#, and the Western Pacific.  Transmission typically occurs when humans walk barefoot on ground contaminated with human feces. $Filariform larvae in the soil #penetrate the skin#, travel through the bloodstream/lymphatics, and enter the alveoli.  They ascend the tracheobronchial tree and are swallowed.  The larvae mature into adult worms in the gastrointestinal tract, enter the mucosa of the duodenum and jejunum, and secrete noninfectious rhabditiform larvae into stool for excretion.  A few @rhabditiform larvae@ mature into filiform larvae in the gastrointestinal tract and reinfect the host through the intestinal mucosa or perianal skin (autoinoculation). $Many patients are asymptomatic because the host immune system keeps the organism in check; however, symptoms may emerge in the setting of #immunocompromise# due to medications (eg, #glucocorticoid therapy#) or comorbid illness (eg, cancer, HIV).  Common manifestations include the following: $• #Larva currens:#  Larvae migrate through cutaneous tissue near the site of penetration, leaving narrow, reddish-brown streaks. $• #Pulmonary symptoms:#  Larvae passing through the lungs can cause dyspnea, wheezing, and dry cough. $• #Gastrointestinal symptoms:#  Larvae in the gastrointestinal tract can cause diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal pain. $Most patients also have peripheral #eosinophilia#.  The diagnosis is typically made when rhabditiform larvae are identified in the stool or, less commonly, sputum. $#(Choice A)#  Mosquitos can transmit viral (eg, dengue) and parasitic (eg, malaria) infections.  However, these illnesses cause high fever and other systemic symptoms shortly after transmission.  Eosinophilia and a nematode (ie, roundworm) in the sputum are more suggestive of helminth infection. $#(Choice B)#  Borrelia burgdorferi, a spirochete, is transmitted by Ixodes scapularis tick bite.  It causes Lyme disease, which typically presents with a migrating, target-shaped rash that may progress to involve the nervous system or joints.  Gastrointestinal/pulmonary symptoms and eosinophilia indicate an alternate diagnosis. $#(Choice D)#  Ingestion of oocysts is a common mode of transmission for protozoan parasites (eg, Giardia, Cryptosporidium), which often cause diarrhea and crampy abdominal pain.  However, a nematode on sputum microscopy indicates a helminth (ie, parasitic worm) infection; helminths (eg, strongyloidiasis, ascariasis, schistosomiasis) produce eggs (containing multicellular embryos), not oocysts (thick-walled spores). $#(Choice E)#  Inhalation of spores can cause a variety of pulmonary fungal infections (eg, histoplasmosis, aspergillosis).  Although these pathogens can cause peripheral eosinophilia and pulmonary symptoms, helminths would not be seen in sputum samples. $#Educational objective# Strongyloides stercoralis is transmitted in tropical/subtropical climates when human skin comes into direct contact with filariform larvae.  The larvae penetrate the skin, enter the bloodstream, pass through the lungs, and are swallowed into the digestive system.  Common manifestations include linear skin rash and irritative digestive/respiratory symptoms.  ",

Infection is not possible in the United States due to absence of the specific #freshwater snails# that incubate the infectious larvae. $Once released into the environment, the larvae can penetrate #intact human skin# and subsequently travel to the #liver# where they mature into adults over a period of several weeks.  After maturation, the adult worms migrate to specific destinations: the mesenteric venules of the #intestine# (S japonicum and S mansoni) or the #urinary bladder# venous plexus (S haematobium).  The adult worms remain in these blood vessels for life (5-30 years), adhering to the vessel wall with suckers and releasing eggs into circulation.  Eggs released by S japonicum and S mansoni have a tendency to penetrate the bowel wall and be excreted in the feces.  They also frequently traverse the portal venous system and lodge in the liver.  S haematobium eggs tend to pierce the vesical and ureteral walls and be expelled in the urine.

  "explanation_2": "$The #50% infectious dose# (ID₅₀) corresponds to the minimum number of organisms required to cause disease in 50% of exposed individuals.  When controlling for the route of exposure and overall health of the host, the ID₅₀ is generally correlated inversely with degree of disease communicability. $The organism in Line 2 (Salmonella) has an ID₅₀ of approximately 107, whereas the organism in Line 1 has a much #lower ID₅₀# #of about 102#.  Of the given options, the organism with the lowest ID₅₀ is #Shigella flexneri#.  Depending on the species, as few as 10 Shigella organisms can cause disease. $The low ID₅₀ of Shigella is related to virulence factors expressed in various locations in the gastrointestinal tract: $• Stomach:  Shigella can #survive a low-pH environment#, the primary reason for its low ID₅₀.  On exposure to acidic conditions, Shigella species upregulate the transcription of #pH-resistant virulence genes#, making them relatively resistant to degradation in the stomach.  This characteristic is in contrast to the acid-sensitivity of Salmonella, which contributes to its higher ID₅₀. $• Proximal small intestine:  Bile salts are normally bactericidal, but exposure to them upregulates production of adhesin proteins and promotes formation of Shigella biofilms. $• Distal small intestine:  Shigella invades cells forming the epithelial barrier and can spread to other cells laterally (ie, cell-to-cell spread) without reentering the gut lumen. $Other organisms that can cause diarrhea with a small inoculum include Campylobacter jejuni (500 organisms), Entamoeba histolytica (1-10), and Giardia lamblia (1-10). $#(Choices A and D)#  Like Salmonella, Clostridium perfringens and Vibrio cholerae are acid sensitive and thrive in more alkaline conditions, requiring a relatively high ID₅₀ (104-108). $#(Choice B)#  Some strains of Escherichia coli that cause gastroenteritis (eg, Shiga toxin–producing E coli) have a low ID₅₀ due to their ability to survive an acidic environment, similar to Shigella.  However, enterotoxigenic E coli is less adaptive to extreme acidity and therefore has a higher ID₅₀. $#(Choice E)#  Yersinia pestis, which causes the plague (eg, fever, buboes), has an extremely low ID₅₀ (<10 organisms) when transmitted via the subcutaneous route (eg, fleas). In contrast, Yersinia enterocolitica (fecal-oral transmission, diarrheal illness) has a higher ID₅₀; although this bacterium produces urease, making it somewhat acid resistant, its growth is improved in more alkaline conditions. $#Educational objective# Shigella species require a low infectious dose to cause gastrointestinal disease.  The mechanism primarily involves their ability to survive in the acidic (low pH) gastric environment.  "

  "explanation_2": "This patient with dysuria and urinary leukocyte esterase and nitrites likely has a #urinary tract infection# (UTI), which is most commonly caused by fecal flora (eg, Escherichia coli).  Females are at increased risk because the urethra is shorter and closer to the anus.  Bacterial growth of a single pathogenic organism on urine culture is typically diagnostic.  However, #urine dipstick# is usually performed initially because it rapidly assesses for UTI pending culture results. $The #most specific# dipstick finding for bacterial UTI is #nitrites#.  Pathophysiology involves production of nitrate reductase by certain bacteria (eg, E coli, Klebsiella, Proteus); this bacterial enzyme reduces normal urinary nitrate (NO3−) to nitrite (NO2−).  The level of nitrites #correlates# with the #incubation time of bacteria# in the bladder. $In patients with UTI caused by nitrate reductase–producing bacteria, dipstick analysis performed on the #first voided urine# in the morning is usually #positive# due to prolonged overnight bacterial incubation (>4 hr), allowing nitrites to accumulate.  In contrast, specimens obtained #during the day# may show #false negative# results, as in this patient's initial sample, because of the shorter duration of urine in the bladder and urinary frequency. $#(Choice A)#  A first-morning void is typically more (not less) concentrated than a sample obtained during the day.  Detection of urinary nitrites is more likely in concentrated than in dilute urine; this is likely related to relatively decreased oral intake of fluids, and therefore urinary frequency as well, leading to a prolonged duration of bacteria in the bladder. $#(Choice B)#  Leukocyte esterase, another common dipstick finding in UTIs, is released by lysed neutrophils/macrophages and is a marker of white blood cell activity and inflammation.  However, nitrite production is not related to white blood cell activity. $#(Choice D)#  Antibiotic-resistant organisms can lead to persistent abnormalities on urine studies despite empiric antibiotic therapy.  However, resistance would not affect bacteria's ability to produce nitrate reductase, and therefore does not explain this patient's new finding of nitrites. $#(Choice E)#  Bacterial contaminants can alter culture results due to the prolonged incubation time of the test.  However, the short duration between urine collection and dipstick analysis is insufficient for nitrite production from contaminants.  Moreover, contaminants that can produce nitrites are typically from the stool, not the skin. $#Educational objective# Nitrites on dipstick are highly specific for urinary tract infections.  False negative results can occur when the incubation time of nitrate reductase–producing bacteria in the bladder is insufficient (eg, frequent urination) to allow for accumulation of bacterial metabolites.

Although these infections can occur in both immunocompetent and immunosuppressed hosts, most cases arise in patients with untreated AIDS who have #CD4 counts <50/mm3#. $MAC organisms are acquired by ingestion or inhalation.

Antibodies against M protein form shortly after acute infection and may cross-react with epitopes on myosin, leading to rheumatic carditis.  ",

HDV can only finish its replication cycle in the setting of #coinfection with hepatitis B virus# (HBV).  HBV encodes for several envelope proteins (HBsAg) that are used to generate the envelope of HDV.  Therefore, universal vaccination against HBV would completely eliminate HDV. $HDV infection can occur as an acute coinfection with hepatitis B or as a superinfection in a chronic HBV carrier.  Infection with HDV dramatically increases the already elevated risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma seen with HBV. $#(Choice A)#  Fulminant viral hepatitis is rare but can occur with any of the hepatitis viruses (A, B, C, D, or E).  Therefore, vaccination against HBV would not eliminate fulminant viral hepatitis. $#(Choice B)#  There is currently no vaccine against hepatitis C virus (HCV).

Typically, such transmission takes place during the passage of the fetus through the birth canal, but transplacental infection can also occur.  This is especially common in those women who developed acute hepatitis B infection in the third# #trimester. $The presence of HBeAg (a soluble protein that is a marker of viral replication and increased infectivity) in the mother significantly increases the risk of vertical transmission of the virus.  Were this woman HBeAg negative, her neonate's risk of infection would be 20%.  If she were HBeAg positive, however, her neonate's risk of infection would be 95%.  Moreover, should the infant become infected, his chance of progression to chronic hepatitis is 90%.  Because of this concern, the newborns of all mothers with active hepatitis B are passively immunized at birth with hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG), followed by active immunization with recombinant HBV vaccine. $#(Choice A)#  HBcAg is not detectable in serum as it is normally sequestrated within the HBsAg coat. $#(Choice B)#  HBsAg is the first virological marker detected in the serum after inoculation, preceding both the elevation of serum aminotransferases and the onset of clinical symptoms.

Risk is greatest in those with long-term domestic exposure to the #Triatomine bug#, which nests in thatched roofing and the cracks of adobe or unfinished brick.  Transmission occurs when the bug feeds on human blood during the night and defecates the underlying pathogen, #Trypanosoma cruzi#, into the bite wound. $Chagas disease is divided into 2 phases: $• The acute phase (8-12 weeks after transmission) is characterized by circulating @trypomastigotes@ that are detectable on blood microscopy.  Most patients are asymptomatic, but a minority develop nonspecific symptoms (eg, fever, malaise, anorexia) and inflammation/swelling at the site of inoculation (eg, eye swelling following conjunctival inoculation). $• The chronic phase begins when the immune system eliminates circulating parasitemia, leading to resolution of acute symptoms.  Patients subsequently develop a prolonged asymptomatic phase (\"indeterminate form\"), whereby serology is positive for T cruzi, but there are no symptoms, signs, detectable parasitemia, or indications of end-organ damage.  After 1-3 decades, a minority of those with asymptomatic chronic infection develop end-organ disease of the heart or gastrointestinal system. $#Chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy# is the most common complication of Chagas disease.  It is thought to be caused by chronic, low-grade, parasite-mediated myocarditis, which leads to the progressive destruction of cardiac fibers and subsequent cardiac fibrosis.  Common complications include biventricular heart failure, cardiac #arrhythmias# (particularly ventricular arrhythmias), and #ventricular aneurysm# with intracardiac thrombus (leads to thromboembolic disease/stroke). $#(Choice A)#  Treponema pallidum has an affinity for the aortic wall and can cause ascending aortic aneurysms (syphilitic aortitis) in patients with tertiary syphilis.

Diagnosis is made with imaging and serology, not blood microscopy. $#(Choice D)#  Lyme disease is a tick-borne illness caused by Borrelia burgdorferi.  Early localized disease is characterized by a migrating erythematous, bull's-eye rash (erythema migrans) and nonspecific symptoms.  Months or years later, patients can develop late manifestations, such as large joint arthritis or Lyme encephalopathy.  B burgdorferi is a spirochete and cannot be seen on standard blood microscopy. $#(Choice E)#  Schistosomiasis is transmitted to humans who swim or bathe in fresh water contaminated with cercariae from infected snails.  The fluke matures in the liver and spreads to the mesenteric vessels, where it releases eggs that can cause end-organ inflammation and fibrosis (eg, periportal liver fibrosis).  Diagnosis is made by identifying eggs in urine or stool, not on blood microscopy. $#Educational objective# Chagas disease is a protozoal illness that is endemic to Latin America.  Patients in rural areas are at greatest risk when their houses harbor the vector (Triatome bug) in adobe walls or thatched roofs.

The risk of HIV infection occurring in an infant born to an HIV-positive mother who received no prenatal #antiretroviral therapy# (ART) can be as high as 35%.  ART during pregnancy reduces the risk of perinatal transmission to 1%-2%.  All pregnant women with HIV should take ART, regardless of their CD4 cell count or viral load. $Triple combination therapy is recommended for HIV-positive pregnant women (as it is for all HIV-positive adults) and most commonly has a backbone of 2 nucleoside/nucleotide #reverse transcriptase inhibitors# along with a third drug (protease inhibitor, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, or integrase inhibitor).  Drugs that are associated with a teratogenic risk (eg, efavirenz in first 8 weeks) or for which there is insufficient evidence during pregnancy are to be avoided.  ART should be continued as long as women are breastfeeding.

Febrile seizures can be caused by any febrile illness, and HHV-6 is one of the most common causes.  However, most patients with HHV-6 infection do not develop seizures.  Primary symptoms include #high fever# for 3-5 days followed by an erythematous #maculopapular rash#.  The @rash@ usually #starts on the trunk# and spreads to the face and extremities.  The diagnosis is based on clinical presentation, and the infection is typically benign and self-limited. $#(Choice A)#  Coxsackievirus A16 is a common cause of @hand, foot, and mouth@ disease in children.  Patients typically have erythematous oropharyngeal ulcers and maculopapular or vesicular lesions on the palms and soles. $#(Choice B)#  Children with primary infection with herpes-simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) have painful @gingivostomatitis@, often accompanied by fever and irritability.  Neonatal HSV, most commonly caused by HSV-2, can present with fever and seizures in the newborn period. $#(Choices D and F)#  @Rubella@ and @measles@ are vaccine-preventable viral infections that typically present with a maculopapular rash on the face that then spreads to the trunk and extremities; both infections can be distinguished from roseola by the pattern of rash development.  In addition, patients with rubella often have Forchheimer spots on the soft palate, and measles is characterized by pathognomonic Koplik spots on buccal mucosa. $#(Choice E)#  Parvovirus B19 causes @erythema infectiosum@, or fifth disease, which can present as a flulike illness followed by a characteristic \"slapped cheek\" rash and truncal reticular rash.  Parvovirus B19 can be associated with aplastic crisis in those with pre-existing hematologic abnormalities (eg, sickle cell anemia). $#(Choice G)#  Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus) can cause acute, exudative pharyngitis that is associated with fever, headache, and abdominal pain in school-aged children.  It can also be accompanied by scarlet fever, a diffuse sandpaper-textured rash most prominent in skinfolds (eg, groin, axillae, antecubital fossa). $#Educational objective# Human herpesvirus 6 infection (roseola) classically presents with fever for 3-5 days followed by a truncal rash.

This indicates that three of the penicillin-binding proteins have been altered in such a way that inhibits the binding of ceftriaxone.  Structural changes in penicillin-binding proteins that prevent ceftriaxone from binding is one mechanism for ceftriaxone resistance. $#(Choice A)#  Beta-lactamases function to degrade penicillin and cephalosporins.  Production of a beta-lactamase would prevent ceftriaxone from being able to bind to the penicillin-binding proteins.  Because ceftriaxone is so much smaller than the penicillin-binding proteins, unbound ceftriaxone would likely accumulate at one of the electrodes.  This would lead to no bands being found within the electrophoresis area. $#(Choice C)#  A salvage metabolic pathway can restore metabolic function that would otherwise be inhibited by an antibiotic such as trimethoprim or sulfamethoxazole. $#(Choice D)#  Transmembranous efflux pumps confer resistance to antibiotics that require entry into the cell to function (e.g., tetracyclines and macrolides).  However, penicillins and cephalosporins function outside of the bacterial cell at the peptidoglycan cell wall. $#(Choice E)#  Upregulation of protein synthesis can occur to overcome the effect of an antibiotic that binds to and irreversibly inhibits the action of that protein.  However, if this were the mechanism for resistance, five bands would still be identified on the radioautography test. $#Educational objective# A change in the structure of penicillin-binding proteins that prevents cephalosporin binding is one mechanism of bacterial resistance to cephalosporins.

Instead, oropharyngeal cancer is frequently associated with #human papillomavirus# (HPV) exposure, particularly in #younger# patients.  HPV-positive HNSCC primarily affects the oropharynx, possibly due to the higher concentration of lymphatic tissue facilitating viral processing.  The most common causative subtypes are #HPV-16 and 18#, which are covered by the HPV vaccine. $HPV is a nonenveloped, double-stranded DNA virus that infects cutaneous and mucosal tissues.  Some strains (eg, HPV-1, HPV-2) cause skin warts.  Others (eg, HPV-6, HPV-11) cause anogenital papillomas or papillomas that affect the upper respiratory tract (ie, recurrent respiratory papillomatosis).  #High-risk strains# (eg, HPV-16, HPV-18) produce proteins #(E6, E7)# that prevent apoptosis, promote cellular proliferation, and cause genetic instability; they are also linked to cancer of the cervix, vulva, anus, and penis. $#(Choice A)#  Coxsackievirus is the leading cause of hand-foot-and-mouth disease, which is characterized by low-grade fever, oral macules/vesicles, and a macular/papular/vesicular rash on the hands, feet, and extremities.  This virus does not typically cause malignant transformation. $#(Choice B)#  Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can also cause HNSCC; however, it is most specifically implicated in the nasopharynx, rather than the oropharynx.  The classic triad of nasopharyngeal carcinoma is a neck mass, nasal obstruction, and a unilateral, persistent middle ear effusion due to @obstruction of the eustachian tube@. $#(Choice C)#  Herpes simplex virus causes latent infection in the sensory nerves.  It is associated with vesicular lesions of the orolabial mucosa, not tonsillar ulcers, and does not cause HNSCC. $#(Choice D)#  HIV increases the risk of many types of cancer due to immune dysregulation.  The risk of cancers related to underlying infections, such as human herpesvirus 8 (Kaposi sarcoma), HPV, EBV, and hepatitis B and C viruses (hepatocellular carcinoma), is particularly increased.

  "explanation_2": "This patient's chronic cough, weight loss, cervical lymphadenopathy, and @cavitary pulmonary lesion@ suggest #active pulmonary tuberculosis# (TB).  Exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis usually results in lifelong latent infection due to the formation of granulomas, which wall off the pathogen and limit spread.  However, the formation and maintenance of granulomas rely on coordination between @monocytes and T lymphocytes@.  #Host conditions# that weaken these aspects of immune function often significantly increase the risk of reactivation TB; these include the following: $• #Chronic kidney disease# is associated with impaired function of monocytes and the cell-mediated immune response due to uremia and hypoalbuminemia.  Risk of TB is increased 6- to 50-fold in this population and is greatest in those with end-stage disease. $• #Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus# is associated with immune impairment and alterations to cytokine signaling, which weaken the development and maintenance of granulomas.  Risk of TB is greatest in those with chronic hyperglycemia (eg, this patient with hemoglobin A1c of 8.5%). $Increased risk of reactivation TB is also seen in those with immunosuppression (eg, HIV, immunomodulatory/glucocorticoid medications), substance abuse, malnutrition, and advanced age. $#(Choice A)#  A tall body habitus is often seen in Marfan syndrome.  Although these individuals have an increased risk of spontaneous pneumothorax, manifestations would include acute shortness of breath and imaging evidence of @air between the lung and chest wall@. $#(Choice B)#  Patients who work with hot tubs and swimming pools can develop hypersensitivity pneumonitis due to inhalation of Mycobacterium avium, a nontuberculous mycobacterium.  Although most cases are marked by acute dyspnea, chronic symptoms can occur.  However, imaging would generally show patchy, @ground-glass pulmonary infiltrates@, not a cavitary lesion. $#(Choice C)#  Living with pets increases the risk of asthma due to increased exposure to allergens.  Asthma is typically marked by recurrent bronchoconstriction with acute periods of dyspnea, wheeze, and cough.  Chest x-ray may show @hyperinflation and bronchial thickening@ but not cavitary infiltration. $#(Choice D)#  Travel to areas endemic for TB can increase risk of exposure and subsequent infection.  Endemic regions include India, sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia.  Denmark has a low incidence of TB; it is unlikely that the patient acquired the infection during his visit to this country. $#Educational objective# Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection is controlled by coordination between macrophages and T lymphocytes.  Conditions that impair immune function increase the risk of active tuberculosis; this includes chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, HIV, substance abuse, malnutrition, and advanced age.  ",

These gram-negative, enteric pathogens reside only in the gastrointestinal tract of humans #(choice B).#  Transmission occurs via the #fecal-oral route#, primarily due to ingestion of #food or water contaminated# by human feces.  Therefore, most cases arise in the developing world where sanitation is poor.  Travelers who have not been vaccinated (with typhoid vaccine) are at risk and may return clinically ill. $Typhoidal Salmonella species invade enterocytes, travel from the apical to the basolateral end of the cell in vacuoles, and emerge in the intestinal submucosa.  Here, the organism is phagocytosed by macrophages but is able to evade destruction due to a specialized capsular antigen (Vi) that impairs the macrophage-mediated oxidative burst.  The pathogen subsequently replicates in an unchecked fashion within macrophages and spreads through the lymphatic and reticuloendothelial system, leading to widespread, systemic illness. $Manifestations typically develop over weeks in a step-wise fashion.  Patients usually develop a #progressive fever#, often with relative bradycardia (#pulse-temperature dissociation#), followed by abdominal pain, salmon-colored macules on the trunk (\"#rose spots#\"), and constipation or diarrhea.  Dissemination through the reticuloendothelial system often causes hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, and leukopenia.  Later, ulceration of Peyer patches (lymphoid aggregations in the small intestine submucosa) can result in gastrointestinal bleeding or intestinal perforation.  Antibiotic treatment is required to prevent complications and death. $#(Choice A)#  Malaria is transmitted by the bite of the female Anopheles mosquito and typically causes paroxysmal fever with nonspecific symptoms (eg, chills, fatigue, headache, myalgias).  However, the fever is almost always associated with tachycardia (not bradycardia), and peripheral blood smear will usually demonstrate the @parasite@ and/or signs of red blood cell lysis. $#(Choice D)#  Meningococcal meningitis is transmitted by aerosolized droplets from a carrier or infected patient and is associated with rapid-onset confusion, sepsis, hypotension, and a petechial/purpuric rash. $#(Choice E)#  Treponema pallidum, the spirochete that causes syphilis, is transmitted sexually.  Secondary syphilis is usually characterized by a widespread maculopapular rash that involves the palms and soles, generalized lymphadenopathy, and constitutional symptoms such as fever, headache, and myalgias.  This patient's pulse-temperature dissociation, limited rash, and lack of adenopathy make syphilis less likely than typhoid fever. $#Educational objective# Typhoid fever is caused by Salmonella Typhi or Paratyphi and presents with escalating fever, followed by abdominal pain, formation of rose spots on the chest/abdomen, and hemorrhagic enteritis with possible bowel perforation.

Initial management is best accomplished through combination therapy with isoniazid (INH), rifampin, pyrazinamide, and either an injectable aminoglycoside or a fluoroquinolone. $#Streptomycin# is one of the older drugs in the aminoglycoside family; therefore, bacterial resistance to this antibiotic is widespread, resulting in its current usage being limited mainly to the treatment of tuberculosis, plague, and tularemia.  Like other aminoglycosides, streptomycin can be administered only parenterally.  It works by interfering with the 16s rRNA of the bacterial #30S ribosomal subunit#, thereby preventing bacterial protein synthesis.  Mutations of the genes that encode ribosomal proteins are responsible for aminoglycoside resistance because they lead to modifications in the ribosomal binding sites for these drugs.  Other resistance mechanisms to aminoglycosides include aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (eg, transferases) and mutated porins. $#(Choice B)#  Structural alteration of enzymes involved in DNA winding-unwinding is the means by which many microorganisms become resistant to fluoroquinolone antibiotics.  Fluoroquinolones inhibit the bacterial enzymes DNA gyrase (topoisomerase II) and topoisomerase IV. $#(Choice C)#  Structural alteration of enzymes involved in RNA synthesis is the mechanism through which organisms become resistant to rifampin.  Rifampin inhibits the bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, thereby preventing the transcription of DNA into mRNA. $#(Choice D)#  Decreased activity of bacterial catalase-peroxidase is a mechanism of mycobacterial resistance to INH.  Mycobacterial catalase-peroxidase is required for the initial enzymatic conversion of INH to its active metabolite within the mycobacterial cells; without this enzyme, INH is unable to inhibit mycobacterial mycolic acid synthesis. $#(Choice E)#  Increased activity of enzymes involved in cell wall polysaccharide synthesis is the means by which mycobacteria develop resistance to ethambutol.  Ethambutol interferes specifically with mycobacterial peptidoglycan cell wall synthesis, possibly through inhibition of arabinosyl transferase.  This drug is ineffective against organisms other than mycobacteria. $#Educational objective# • The aminoglycoside streptomycin inhibits protein synthesis by inactivating the 30S (small) ribosomal subunit. $• Decreased activity of bacterial catalase-peroxidase is a mechanism of mycobacterial resistance to isoniazid. $• Structural alteration of enzymes involved in RNA synthesis (DNA-dependent RNA polymerase) is the mechanism through which organisms become resistant to rifampin.

IgA antibodies usually bind to pili and other membrane proteins involved in bacterial adherence to mucosa, thus inhibiting mucosal colonization by the microorganism. $Certain bacteria (eg, N gonorrhoeae, N meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae) produce #IgA proteases# that cleave IgA at its hinge region (yielding Fab and compromised Fc fragments), thus decreasing its effectiveness.  This facilitates #bacterial adherence to mucosa# (possibly due to easier bacterial access to mucosal surface or immune disguise by binding to released Fab fragments, among others). $#(Choice B)#  IgA is a weak activator of the classic complement pathway.  Impairment of complement-mediated cell lysis can be accomplished by @staphylococcal protein A@, which binds the Fc portion of IgG, preventing complement fixation. $#(Choice C)#  Although IgA Fc-mediated functions such as opsonization are compromised by IgA protease, secretory IgA is a poor opsonin.  Impairment of opsonization and phagocytosis is most frequently accomplished by encapsulated bacteria such as S pneumoniae, N meningitidis, and H influenzae. $#(Choice D)#  IgA does not play a role in the induction of memory lymphocytes necessary for mounting a secondary immune response (which requires the formation of memory B and T lymphocytes after initial antigen exposure). $#(Choice E)#  Promotion of intracellular survival is accomplished by inhibition of phagosome-lysosome fusion or resistance to lysosomal enzymes.  These properties are expressed by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M leprae, Legionella, and Ehrlichia. $#Educational objective# IgA protease is produced by Neisseria meningitidis, N gonorrhoeae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae.

These symptoms are followed by a @maculopapular exanthem@ that starts on the face and spreads down the trunk and extremities. $The parents' refusal of preventive medicine also supports a diagnosis of measles, as the child likely did not receive the combined measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. $#(Choice A)#  Hepatitis A spreads through the fecal-oral route and is generally an acute and self-limited disease.  Hepatitis B is transmitted via bodily fluids and causes acute and chronic disease.  These viruses cause elevated liver enzymes and hyperbilirubinemia (jaundice). $#(Choice C)#  @Mumps@ is a member of the Paramyxoviridae family and spreads by respiratory droplets or person-to-person contact.  Infection classically causes parotitis, orchitis, and aseptic meningitis. $#(Choice D)#  Pertussis is caused by the gram-negative bacteria Bordetella pertussis and spread by respiratory droplets.  It is highly contagious and presents with paroxysms of cough and an inspiratory \"whoop\" sound in children. $#(Choice E)#  @Epiglottitis@ is linked with Haemophilus influenzae type b, a gram-negative, encapsulated bacteria spread by respiratory droplets.  Patients often present with tripod positioning in an attempt to increase airflow due to life-threatening airway obstruction. $#(Choice F)#  A diffuse vesicular rash of different stages is typical of @chickenpox@, or varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection.  VZV is a double-stranded, enveloped, DNA virus that is part of the Herpesviridae family.  Transmission occurs via aerosolized droplets or direct contact. $#(Choice G)#  Rotavirus, a double-stranded RNA virus of the Reoviridae family, causes profuse watery diarrhea in infants, potentially leading to dehydration and death. $#Educational objective# Measles presents with fever, cough, rhinorrhea, and conjunctivitis followed by a maculopapular rash that starts on the face and spreads downwards.

  "explanation_2": "This child has #diphtheria#, a disease caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae and now rarely seen in most countries as a result of vaccination.  The A (active) subunit of the diphtheria AB #exotoxin# transfers a ribose residue from NAD to a histidine on #elongation factor-2# (EF-2).  The EF-2 protein is essential for peptide chain translocation on the ribosome in the process of translation.  #Ribosylation# inactivates EF-2, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis and causing cell death. $#(Choice A)#  Group A Streptococcus (GAS) pharyngitis can lead to rheumatic fever via antigenic mimicry.  GAS and cardiac myocytes have similar antigenic protein sequences.  Therefore, when the immune system mounts a response against GAS, it may also cause myocarditis and valve destruction over time.  GAS pharyngitis is not typically due to exotoxins and does not classically cause local neuropathies (eg, soft palate paralysis). $#(Choice B)#  Lecithinase (also known as phospholipase C, or Clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin) is the exotoxin released by C perfringens.  This enzyme degrades membrane phospholipids (including lecithin), leading to cell membrane destruction and cell death.  C perfringens causes gas gangrene. $#(Choice C)#  The shiga toxin of Shigella and the shigalike toxin of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) cause inactivation of the 60S ribosomal subunit.  By contrast, diphtheria toxin inactivates EF-2, not the ribosome itself.  Shigella and EHEC cause diarrheal illnesses. $#(Choice D)#  Pertussis toxin is an AB exotoxin released by Bordetella pertussis that catalyzes ribosylation of G protein αi subunits.  This results in increased cAMP production, which leads to increased insulin production, lymphocyte and neutrophil dysfunction, and increased sensitivity to histamine.  Classic pertussis has a catarrhal stage (mild upper respiratory symptoms), a paroxysmal stage (whooping cough), and a convalescent stage. $#Educational objective# Diphtheria toxin is an AB exotoxin that ribosylates and inactivates elongation factor-2.

  "explanation_2": "$#Human hookworm# infection is caused by Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale.  These pathogens are called hookworms because the head of the worm is often curved away from the body, giving the organism a \"hooked\" appearance.  Most cases occur in #tropical and subtropical# regions where sanitation is poor.  Transmission occurs when #egg-containing human feces# is deposited into shady, warm, moist soil, which allows the eggs to hatch into larvae.  Spread occurs when larvae come into direct #contact with human skin# (eg, when walking barefoot). $Dermal penetration often results in a transient, pruritic, maculopapular or serpiginous rash at the entry site.  The larvae then spread through the bloodstream to the lungs, where they rupture into the alveoli and are subsequently coughed up and swallowed.  In the small intestine, the larvae mature into adults, attach to the gastrointestinal mucosa, and feed on human blood by lacerating capillaries.  Because these organisms can live in the gastrointestinal tract for up to 14 years, total blood loss can be substantial.  Therefore, the biggest risk of hookworm infection is iron-deficiency anemia #(microcytic anemia)# due to chronic blood loss. $Although many patients with hookworm infection are asymptomatic for months or years, some individuals develop transient pulmonary symptoms (eg, cough) during pulmonary migration or gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) during gastrointestinal migration.  Diagnosis is generally made when smooth, thin-walled @hookworm eggs@ are identified by stool microscopy.  Peripheral #eosinophilia #is also an important diagnostic clue. $#(Choice A)#  Lymphatic filariasis is a mosquito-borne illness caused by roundworms (eg, Wuchereria bancrofti).  Most patients are infected in childhood and remain asymptomatic, but a minority develops chronic lymphedema, which may result in elephantiasis.  Eggs are not present in stool; diagnosis is made by serology or by identifying worms in the lymphatic system. $#(Choice B)#  Chagas disease is linked to dilated cardiomyopathy and is most common in Latin America.  It is caused by the protozoa Trypanosoma cruzi.  Transmission occurs during a triatomine bug bite.  Although transient skin and gastrointestinal symptoms can occur during acute infection, eggs are not seen in the stool; diagnosis is made mostly by serology or by blood microscopy. $#(Choice C)#  Toxocariasis is caused by infection with dog or cat roundworms.  Migrating larva cause a significant eosinophilic granulomatous response that can result in ocular (endophthalmitis) and organ damage.  Diagnosis is made by serology; the organism does not shed eggs in the gastrointestinal tract. $#(Choice E)#  Diphyllobothriasis is caused by infection with a fish tapeworm and is classically linked with megaloblastic anemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency.  Although the eggs can be seen on stool microscopy, they are distinguished by a lid-like opening (operculum).  In addition, a transient skin rash would not be a feature of this disease. $#Educational objective# Hookworms are transmitted when human skin comes into contact with soil contaminated with human feces.  The larvae penetrate the skin, travel to the lungs, are coughed up, and then subsequently swallowed.  Adult hookworms live in the small intestine and feed on human blood.  Therefore, chronic iron deficiency anemia (microcytic anemia) is the greatest complication.  ",

Neutropenic fever without an identifiable source (eg, normal chest x-ray, normal urine culture, normal examination) is believed to be caused by translocation of endogenous bacteria into the bloodstream from #mucositis#, which results from chemotherapy-induced disruption of the gastrointestinal epithelium.  Patients with severe neutropenia are at higher risk for #overwhelming bacterial infection# due to a blunted neutrophil-mediated inflammatory response. $This patient's #very rapid onset# (eg, 4 hours) of fever and signs of septic shock (eg, hypotension, tachycardia) is most consistent with a #gram-negative bacterial infection# (eg, Pseudomonas aeruginosa).

In addition, the presentation is usually subacute over days to weeks (vs 4 hours). $#(Choice E)#  Invasive fungal infections can occur in neutropenic patients.  However, they are typically slower growing (vs 4 hours) and are rarely the cause of an initial presentation of neutropenic fever.  Instead, they are more commonly found in patients with persistent (eg, 7 days) or recurrent neutropenic fever who are at high risk (eg, increased number of chemotherapy cycles). $#Educational objective# Patients with neutropenic fever (ie, temperature >38.3 C [>101 F] and absolute neutrophil count <500/mm3) are at risk for overwhelming bacterial infections.

It invades the skeletal muscle and causes severe muscle pain, swelling, and tenderness.  Periorbital edema and eosinophilia are often important diagnostic clues; infection is typically confirmed with serology (not culture). $#(Choice E)#  @Dengue fever@, also called breakbone fever, is a mosquito-borne viral infection associated with fever, severe myalgias, arthralgias, and maculopapular rash.  Hemorrhagic complications can occur.  The diagnosis is usually made clinically; Thayer-Martin media would not yield an organism (as it is a viral pathogen). $#Educational objective# Neisseria gonorrhoeae is spread sexually by genitourinary secretions and can be prevented by the consistent use of condoms.  Genitourinary infections are often asymptomatic, which increases the risk of spread through the bloodstream, leading to disseminated gonococcal infection.  Patients with disseminated disease typically present with the triad of polyarthralgia, tenosynovitis, and dermatitis or purulent arthritis.  ",

The agglutination test may be negative at the beginning of the infection and can be repeated later for confirmation.  Because the Monospot (horse erythrocyte agglutination) test was negative on 2 separate occasions in this patient with a mononucleosis-like syndrome (fever, fatigue, splenomegaly, atypical lymphocytosis), his symptoms are #unlikely# to be due to EBV; the lack of sore throat and lymphadenopathy is also atypical for classic EBV-associated IM #(choice C).# $In immunocompetent patients with a #heterophile antibody-negative mononucleosis-like syndrome#, the most likely diagnosis is #cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection#.  Pharyngitis and lymphadenopathy are seen less commonly than with EBV.  CMV can be acquired during the transfusion of leukocyte-laden blood products, as the virus infects leukocytes of granulocyte-macrophage lineage.  Irradiation helps reduce this risk.  Other causes of heterophile antibody-negative mononucleosis-like syndromes include human herpesvirus-6, HIV, and toxoplasmosis. $#(Choice A)#  Coxsackie A viruses cause aseptic meningitis and herpangina (fever, posterior pharyngeal gray vesicles/ulcers) in children. $#(Choice D)#  Acute hepatitis C (HCV) rarely causes symptoms.  Transfusion-acquired HCV can cause chronic hepatitis, but highly sensitive blood donor screening tests have led to low transmission rates.  Atypical lymphocytosis is less common with HCV than with EBV or CMV. $#(Choice E)#  JC virus causes progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a central nervous system viral infection seen in immunocompromised patients.  Clinical manifestations include hemiparesis, visual field defects (eg, hemianopsia), and cognitive impairment. $#(Choice F)#  Parvovirus B19 causes erythema infectiosum, a childhood illness characterized by red, flushed cheeks (\"slapped cheeks\" appearance).  The virus can also cause aplastic crises in patients with sickle cell anemia and hydrops fetalis in the fetus. $#Educational objective# The Monospot test is positive in most cases of Epstein-Barr virus-associated mononucleosis.

Binding of aminoglycoside causes the cell to misread mRNA and, as a result, it is unable to perform protein synthesis.  An important mechanism of #resistance# to aminoglycosides is the #methylation# of the aminoglycoside-binding portion of the ribosome, which inhibits the ability of aminoglycosides to interfere with protein translation.  Other common resistance mechanisms are the production of enzymes that inactivate the drug by altering its chemical structure or the production of an efflux pump that decreases the drug's intracellular concentration. $#(Choices B and D)#  Carbapenems and penicillins function similarly to other beta-lactam antibiotics by inhibiting a family of enzymes responsible for cell wall construction.  Resistance to both can occur through alteration of the antibiotic binding site on the enzyme; decreased permeability of the antibiotic into the cell wall; or production of beta-lactamases, which alter the antibiotic structure by cleaving protein bonds in the antibiotic and inactivating it. $#(Choice C)#  Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic used to treat methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections.  It binds to D-alanine-D-alanine, thereby preventing peptidoglycan cell wall synthesis.  Bacteria have been identified in which a D-alanine is replaced by a D-lactate, leading to vancomycin resistance. $#(Choice E)#  Resistance to the quinolones occurs by alteration of the genes encoding for DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, development of an efflux pump, or alteration of the membrane diffusion channels used by the antibiotic. $#Educational objective# Aminoglycosides work by interfering with the 30S ribosomal subunit and causing the cell to misread messenger RNA, thereby halting protein synthesis.

Reactivation can occur at any time but is most common in the setting of immunosuppression. $In patients with HIV, #CMV colitis# is the second most common reactivation syndrome after CMV retinitis.  Patients with CMV colitis have fever, anorexia, weight loss, and abdominal pain.  The pain may be vague initially but becomes more localized as the disease progresses.  Colonoscopy shows mucosal erythema, erosions, and ulcerations.  Histologic examination of biopsy specimens will reveal acute and chronic inflammatory changes, vasculitis, and large cells with large, ovoid nuclei containing #centralized intranuclear basophilic inclusions# (@owl's eye appearance@). $#(Choice A)#  Patients with advanced AIDS are at risk for disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex, which is often associated with diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss.

However, it primarily affects the small intestine, not the colon.  Oocysts can be identified in the stool using microscopy with modified acid-fast stain; biopsy will show basophilic parasites attached to the mucosal brush border. $#(Choice C)#  Candida albicans is a normal part of human flora that often causes oropharyngeal and esophageal infections in patients with advanced AIDS.  However, Candida and other yeasts (eg, Histoplasma capsulatum) are a rare cause of colitis. $#(Choice E)#  Clostridium difficile is an exotoxin-producing, anaerobic bacterium that can cause severe colitis, most commonly after antibiotic use.

These proteins are generated as a polyprotein (gp160) from the env gene.  Unlike the gag-pol polyprotein (which is cleaved by HIV protease) the env polyprotein is cleaved by a host protease, so production of glycosylated viral envelope proteins is not affected by HIV protease inhibitors. $#(Choices B and D)#  The pol gene encodes the major HIV enzymes: reverse transcriptase (RT), integrase, and protease.  RT converts the HIV RNA genome into complementary double-stranded DNA; it also destroys the HIV RNA genomic template during transcription (ribonuclease H activity).  RT is inhibited by nucleoside/nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.  Integrase inserts complementary viral DNA into the host chromosome.  Integrase strand transfer inhibitors block the function of this enzyme.  Both RT and integrase inhibitors block viral replication, but neither are associated with immature virions containing polyproteins. $#(Choice E)#  The HIV genome encodes for several regulatory proteins that are required for viral replication.  However, all virus-encoded proteins are translated by host ribosomes, and blockade of protein translation would not be associated with the formation of polyproteins. $#Educational objective# The HIV genome contains 3 major structural genes that are translated as polyproteins and subsequently cleaved by host protease (env gene products) or viral protease (gag-pol gene products) into the individual proteins that compose the HIV virus.

Transmission in low-prevalence countries (eg, United States) is usually due to injection drug use or unprotected sex. $HBV is an encapsulated virus with a partially double-stranded DNA genome.  It binds to and enters hepatocytes using a host cell bile salt transporter and then sheds its coat in the host cytoplasm.  The partially double-stranded genome is \"repaired\" and transcribed by host cell machinery, yielding a #+ sense single-stranded mRNA template#.  This serves as a #pre-genome# for future progeny; it is converted by #viral reverse transcriptase# into the partially double-stranded DNA genome of budding viral particles (which are subsequently released from the cell).

In contrast, HIV must integrate into the host genome in order to replicate.  Integrase inhibitors (eg, dolutegravir) target this step in HIV replication. $#(Choice D)#  HBV is released via exocytosis from host cells and is not considered a lytic virus.  Hepatocyte damage occurs primarily when cytotoxic T cells recognize HBV antigens on infected cells.  Patients who clear the virus have a robust, polyclonal, cytotoxic T-cell response.  Those that develop latent infection often have a much weaker and narrower cytotoxic T-cell response. $#Educational objective# Hepatitis B virus has a partially double-stranded DNA genome and contains a viral DNA polymerase with reverse transcriptase activity.

  "explanation_2": "$#Conjugation# is a form of horizontal gene transfer that involves direct #cell-to-cell contact# between two adjacent bacteria.  It allows for the propagation of genetic elements that confer beneficial traits such as #antibiotic resistance#, the ability to use new metabolites, or the ability to tolerate a difficult microenvironment.  The transferred genetic element is a #conjugative plasmid# (separate from the genome) or an integrated conjugative element (present in the genome). $Conjugation begins when proteins encoded by the conjugative element aggregate on the plasma membrane of the donor bacteria, forming a #pilus# (a #hair-like# appendage).  The pilus elongates until it attaches to an adjacent bacterium and then progressively shortens, which pulls the bacteria together.  The plasmid DNA in the donor cell is then nicked and relaxed, and a single DNA strand is transferred through the mating bridge from the donor to the recipient bacterium.  A complementary DNA strand is then generated in each bacterium, which completes the plasmid transfer. $Conjugation is a major mechanism for #Shigella antibiotic resistance#.  A single Shigella plasmid encodes resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, sulfonamides, streptomycin, and trimethoprim.  Other plasmids encode resistance to azithromycin and fluoroquinolones.  Risk of resistant strains is greatest in patients with #HIV# and/or men who have sex with men, but antibiotic susceptibility testing is required for all infections due to high rates of resistance across patient populations. $#(Choices B and C)#  The two other forms of horizontal gene transfer are transduction and transformation.  @Transduction@ involves the introduction of foreign DNA into a bacterial cell by a virus or viral vector.  @Transformation@ involves the uptake of free DNA from the environment through the cell membrane.  Neither involves direct contact between bacterial cells or the formation of pili. $#(Choice D)#  Transposition involves the movement of a DNA sequence from one location to another within the genome (frequently with duplication of the transposon), which often results in genetic mutations due to incorrect DNA repair and/or insertional mutagenesis. $#(Choice E)#  Vertical gene transfer is the transmission of genes from parent to offspring.  This occurs in bacteria when they divide by binary fission; it does not involve pili. $#Educational objective# Conjugation is a form of horizontal gene transfer that involves the formation of a pilus and the direct passing of genetic material from one bacterium to another.  It is a common source of antibiotic resistance and environmental adaptation.  The other forms of bacterial horizontal gene transfer are transduction (viral vector) and transformation (uptake of free DNA).  ",

  "explanation_2": "#Nasopharyngeal carcinoma# is an epithelial tumor that usually originates in the pharyngeal recess.  Local tumor growth often leads to epistaxis and headaches, and metastatic spread to cervical lymph nodes frequently causes firm, fixed neck swelling.  NPC is relatively uncommon in the United States but is endemic to #southern China#, where genetic and dietary factors (eg, consumption of salted fish) predispose to premalignant nasopharyngeal epithelial lesions.  Subsequent #malignant transformation# is then induced by #Epstein-Barr virus# (EBV). $EBV is a ubiquitous human herpes virus that causes infectious mononucleosis in a minority of patients (primary infection is usually asymptomatic).  Initial infection is followed by life-long #latent infection# in memory B cells.  While latent, the EBV genome exists as an episome in the nucleus of infected cells and expresses a restricted subset of EBV genes (#latency genes#) which do the following: $• Promote periodic viral reactivation from memory B-cells, leading to recurrent (asymptomatic) mucosal infections. $• Promote survival of infected memory B cells by encoding for proteins (eg, EBNA-1, LMP1) that prevent apoptosis.  In a minority of patients, these proteins are oncogenic and lead to #malignant transformation# of infected B cells (eg, Burkitt lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma) or premalignant epithelial cells (eg, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, salivary cancer). $Individuals who do not have premalignant epithelial lesions are at very low risk of EBV-associated epithelial cancers like NPC. $#(Choice A)#  Adenovirus causes acute upper respiratory infection with pharyngitis, coryza, otitis media, bronchitis, and/or pneumonia.  It is not associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. $#(Choice B)#  Coronavirus is one of the most common causes of upper respiratory tract infection (eg, common cold) but has no association with nasopharyngeal or other cancers. $#(Choices C and E)#  Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8) are also herpes viruses; as such, they cause acute infection followed by latent disease.  Although CMV can reactivate in immunocompromised individuals (eg, HIV, post-transplantation) and cause severe end-organ disease (eg, retinitis, gastroenteritis), it is not an oncogenic virus.  HHV-8 reactivation also primarily occurs in immunocompromised individuals and is associated with Kaposi sarcoma. $#(Choice F)#  The BK and JC viruses are members of Polyomaviridae and cause life-long latent infections in the kidney.  BK reactivation can cause nephropathy in renal transplant recipients, and JC virus causes progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (primarily in patients with advanced HIV). $#Educational objective# Nasopharyngeal cancer is endemic in southern China due to genetic and dietary factors that promote nasopharyngeal epithelial pre-malignant lesions.  In almost all cases, malignant transformation occurs due to infection of premalignant cells with Epstein-Barr virus and the subsequent expression of oncogenic viral proteins.  "

Nontoxigenic strains are minimally infectious; toxigenic strains are virulent and cause the clinical syndrome of #diphtheria#.  Conversion from nontoxigenic to toxigenic C diphtheriae occurs due to infection with a #lysogenic bacteriophage# called Corynephage beta.  This phage inserts the tox gene into the C diphtheriae genome, which results in the bacterial expression of the #diphtheria AB toxin#.  Diphtheria toxin irreversibly halts protein synthesis due to ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor-2 and causes severe local (eg, pseudomembranous pharyngitis) and systemic (eg, myocarditis, neuritis) effects. $#(Choice A)#  Conjugation is the direct transfer of plasmids from one bacterium to another through a pilus.  Genes for antibiotic resistance are often transmitted in this manner. $#(Choice B)#  Chromosomal mutations can theoretically lead to endotoxin production, but mutations more commonly lead to bacterial antibiotic resistance. $#(Choice C)#  The gram-positive, spore-forming rods Bacillus and Clostridium generate toxins under environmental influences.  The B anthracis spore, the causative agent in anthrax, survives in soil for extended periods in a state of dormancy.  Only upon warming to 37° C in the presence of appropriate concentrations of CO2 and protein do the spores germinate and begin to synthesize toxin.  The case is similar for C tetani spores, which germinate and produce toxin only in anaerobic environments, such as necrotic wounds. $#(Choice E)#  Transformation involves the direct uptake of genetic material from the environment with subsequent incorporation into the bacterial genome.  Streptococcus pneumoniae acquires the ability to produce capsules via transformation.  The capsule is the major virulence factor for S pneumoniae; strains without the capsule are not pathogenic. $#Educational objective# Lysogenic bacteriophages are responsible for converting nonpathogenic Corynebacterium into toxigenic Corynebacterium.

The biopsy shows fungal #hyphae# branching at #acute angles# with #septations#, findings characteristic of #Aspergillus fumigatus#.  This fungus is widely distributed in the environment and commonly grows on decaying vegetables.  It is monomorphic, existing only in mold form (ie, multicellular hyphae). $Aspergillus causes the following conditions: $• #Invasive aspergillosis# develops in #immunosuppressed patients#.  The prolonged neutropenia associated with leukemia and lymphoma treatment is a strong risk factor.  It most commonly affects the lung and can cause fever, pleuritic chest pain, and hemoptysis.  Aspergillus has a predilection for blood vessels and can spread hematogenously, causing infection and infarcts involving the skin, paranasal sinuses, kidneys, endocardium, and brain.  Diagnosis is made by light microscopy, which reveals V-shaped, narrow, septate hyphae invading the tissue.  Voriconazole is used to treat invasive aspergillosis. $• #Aspergillomas# are Aspergillus #fungus balls# that grow in old lung cavities (eg, produced by tuberculosis or bronchiectasis).  They are limited to the preexisting cavity; invasion of the surrounding lung tissue is rare in immunocompetent patients.  Aspergillomas are often surgically removed. $• #Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis# occurs in asthma and presents with wheezing and migratory pulmonary infiltrates.

On light microscopy, it appears as an oval, budding yeast with pseudohyphae (ie, not true hyphae but rather elongated yeast cells). $#(Choice E)#  @Cryptococcus neoformans@, an oval, budding yeast with a thick capsule, causes meningitis and lung infections in AIDS.  India ink stain of cerebrospinal fluid shows a wide, clear zone around the cell corresponding to the unstained capsule. $#(Choices G and H)#  Malassezia furfur and Microsporum canis can cause cutaneous fungal infections.

However, transmission to humans occasionally occurs when B anthracis #spores# are inhaled, ingested, or inoculated into the skin. $Inhalation of spores into the alveoli causes #pulmonary anthrax#.  Alveolar macrophages phagocytose the spores and bring them to mediastinal lymph nodes, where the spores germinate into vegetative rods and multiply.

Initial HSV infections are marked by viral replication at the site of exposure (eg, perioral or genital skin), which leads to vesicular @mucocutaneous@ lesions and flulike symptoms.  Manifestations last a week or two and then resolve spontaneously when viral replication ceases.  However, the virus also spreads to dermal nerve terminals and is transported in a retrograde fashion to the #sensory ganglia#, where it establishes a lifelong #latent infection# within the #neuronal cell bodies#. $During latent infection, no viral replication occurs, so the disease is asymptomatic.  However, infected cells continue to produce some HSV genes (eg, latency-associated transcript gene), and stress and other triggers can reactivate viral replication and lead to the re-emergence of symptoms (eg, vesicular lesions on the oral/genital mucous membranes, low-grade fever, malaise).  Recurrent symptoms last a week or two and then resolve; they are often less severe than the initial episode. $#(Choice A)#  Although strains of malaria with dormant liver phases (eg, Plasmodium ovale, Plasmodium vivax) can cause relapsing symptoms every 6-8 weeks, this patient was diagnosed with a viral (not parasitic) infection and had infrequent relapses over years.  Infection with hepatitis B or C is typically asymptomatic for years or decades; affected patients eventually develop progressive cirrhosis and related complications (eg, jaundice, ascites, encephalopathy). $#(Choice C)#  Epstein-Barr virus has a tropism for B-lymphocytes.

The disease is rare in the developed world due to widespread vaccination with diphtheria toxoid, but outbreaks often occur in regions where vaccination efforts are insufficient (eg, Southeast Asia).  Most cases are transmitted by aerosolized droplets from asymptomatic carriers or infected patients.  Although the pathogen has little capacity for invasion, it generates a #potent exotoxin# (diphtheria toxin) that irreversibly inhibits protein synthesis through ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor-2, leading to host cell death and necrosis.  Local effects of the toxin include pharyngitis and laryngotracheitis, often with an #extensive#, #coalescing exudate# (pseudomembrane).  Absorption of the toxin into the bloodstream results in potentially life-threatening #myocarditis# and neuritis. $Diphtheria can be prevented with the diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus (DPT) childhood vaccination, which generates #neutralizing IgG antibodies# against the binding component (B subunit) of the diphtheria exotoxin.

  "explanation_2": "Early #penicillin# treatment of #group A streptococcal pharyngitis# is important for the #prevention of acute rheumatic fever# (ARF), a major cause of cardiovascular death in many developing nations.  ARF primarily affects the heart and central nervous system because host antibodies produced in response to streptococcal antigens cross-react with host antigens in these organs.  Chronic cardiac inflammation can progress to rheumatic heart disease, specifically valvular disease.  The #mitral valve# is the most commonly affected and gradually thickens, fibroses, and calcifies, eventually requiring valvotomy or more invasive surgical intervention. $#Empiric therapy# for a condition must be considered in the context of the host characteristics, pre-test probability of the disease, benefits/risks of waiting for a definitive diagnosis, and cost of therapy versus its potential complications.  If all cases of acute streptococcal pharyngitis were treated empirically, the incidence of rheumatic heart disease and associated cardiac procedures would likely decrease. $#(Choice A)#  Antibiotic use can promote diarrhea by altering the gut microbial milieu.  This alteration can lead to overgrowth of Clostridium difficile, a gram-positive bacterium that can cause profuse, watery diarrhea and life-threatening fulminant colitis.  Therefore, increasing antibiotic use would likely result in increased diarrheal illness and potential complications. $#(Choice B)#  Serum sickness-like reactions are associated with certain infections (eg, hepatitis B) and antibiotics (eg, penicillin).  The development of circulating drug-specific immune complexes may cause fever, rash, and arthritis.  If penicillin was used more frequently, serum sickness-like reactions would potentially increase, not decrease. $#(Choice C)#  Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) is the most common cause of nephritic syndrome in children worldwide.  It is caused by deposition of immune complexes in glomeruli following pharyngitis or skin infections with group A Streptococcus.  Although early antibiotics are effective in preventing ARF, they have not been shown to reduce the risk of PSGN. $#(Choice E)#  Empiric use of potentially unnecessary antibiotics may cause an increase in antibiotic resistance, thereby increasing the need for broad-spectrum antibiotics.  For example, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) evolved from methicillin-sensitive S aureus via alteration of the protein binding site for beta-lactam antibiotics.  As a result, broad-spectrum antibiotics (eg, vancomycin, daptomycin) are required for MRSA infections. $#Educational objective# Acute rheumatic fever is a complication of untreated group A streptococcal pharyngitis.  Rheumatic heart disease is the most common cause of acquired valvular heart disease and cardiovascular death in developing countries.  The incidence of acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease has been reduced in industrialized nations with prompt treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis with penicillin.  "

  "explanation_2": "This patient most likely has #typhoid fever#, an #invasive# Salmonella infection.  #Salmonella# species are gram-negative, non–lactose-fermenting, motile enteric rods divided into nontyphoidal and typhoidal strains.  Both strains penetrate enterocytes, where they travel in vacuoles from the apical to the basolateral end of the cell and invade the lamina propria.  However, the pathogenesis then diverges, as follows: $• Nontyphoidal strains (eg, S Enteritidis) are phagocytosed by neutrophils and macrophages in the lamina propria and induce a massive inflammatory response with neutrophilic infiltration.  This cytokine-mediated response causes gastroenteritis (eg, watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever), which usually self-resolves, as in this patient's prior history. $• In contrast, #typhoidal strains# contain specialized virulence factors (eg, Vi capsular antigen) that #inhibit neutrophil recruitment and phagocytosis#, limiting the acute inflammatory response that helps contain nontyphoidal species.  It also inhibits macrophages from generating an oxidative burst to destroy the bacteria, allowing the pathogen to undergo extensive, #unchecked intraphagocytic replication# and dissemination through the lymphatic and reticuloendothelial system.  This results in typhoid fever, as seen in this patient. $Manifestations begin approximately a week after transmission of the typhoidal strain, which typically occurs via consumption of food or water contaminated by human feces in regions of poor sanitation.  Initial symptoms include an #escalating fever# that is often associated with relative bradycardia (#pulse-temperature dissociation#).  A week later, patients typically develop abdominal pain, diarrhea or constipation, hepatosplenomegaly, and transient salmon-colored macules (#rose spots#) on the trunk.  Blood culture is diagnostic. $#(Choice A)#  Contact between Entamoeba histolytica and the host cell results in insertion of an amebic channel-forming protein in the host cell membrane, causing cell death.  Symptoms include bloody diarrhea and/or extraintestinal manifestations (eg, liver abscess).  Rash is uncommon, and blood cultures would not show gram-negative rods. $#(Choice B)#  Campylobacter infection causes acute, self-limited diarrhea (<7 days) and may result in cross-reacting antibodies to ganglioside GM1, leading to Guillain-Barré syndrome.  Rose spots, hepatosplenomegaly, and pulse-temperature dissociation would not be expected. $#(Choice D)#  Rotavirus and Giardia damage intestinal villi, leading to intestinal malabsorption due to villous blunting and decreased levels of brush border enzymes (eg, maltase, lactase). $#Educational objective# Typhoidal strains of Salmonella contain a capsular antigen (Vi) and other virulence factors that inhibit neutrophil phagocytosis, neutrophil recruitment, and macrophage-mediated destruction.  Therefore, typhoidal Salmonella undergoes extensive replication in macrophages and is able to spread through the lymphatic and reticuloendothelial system, leading to widespread systemic disease (typhoid fever).

The most common species is Plasmodium falciparum, which is endemic to #sub-Saharan Africa#, New Guinea, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti.  The second most prevalent species is Plasmodium vivax, which is endemic to Central and South America and the western Pacific region.  The 2 other species (Plasmodium ovale, Plasmodium malariae) are responsible for only a small minority of cases. $Malaria is most often diagnosed by examination of a peripheral blood smear with Giemsa staining.  Because each of the 4 main species appears differently on blood smear, this test also helps identify the infecting species.  In P falciparum infection, red blood cells have #multiple small rings# representing developing #trophozoites# (arrows) and banana-shaped gametocytes (not shown). $For malaria acquired in @areas@ known to have chloroquine-sensitive organisms, chloroquine is the treatment of choice.  However, most African Plasmodium species are #chloroquine resistant# and require treatment with #atovaquone-proguanil# or #artemisinins#, which are well tolerated and have excellent cure rates.  Because P vivax and P ovale have dormant liver forms (hypnozoites), primaquine therapy should be added to the treatment regimen for these species. $#(Choice A)#  Amphotericin B is used to treat leishmaniasis, a parasitic disease transmitted by sandflies.

Giemsa stain of a thick smear of blood would show @microfilariae@. $#(Choice D)#  Nifurtimox is used to treat trypanosomiasis, a protozoal illness endemic to Africa that causes sleeping sickness.  CNS manifestations (eg, altered personality, stupor, excessive daytime somnolence) are prominent due to meningoencephalitis.  Giemsa stain would show @trypanosomes@. $#(Choice E)#  Because most species of Plasmodium are now resistant to pyrimethamine, it is not typically used in treatment of malaria.  Pyrimethamine can be used to treat toxoplasmosis, which most often causes symptomatic disease (eg, encephalitis) in patients with AIDS. $#Educational objective# Blood microscopy findings that show red blood cells filled with multiple small rings suggest Plasmodium infection (malaria).  Erythrocytic forms of this parasite are treated with antimalarials such as chloroquine (in nonresistant areas), atovaquone-proguanil, or artemisinins.

Th1 cells release #interferon-gamma#, which activates macrophages and allows them to form fully mature (acidified) phagolysosomes capable of efficiently killing the intracellular bacteria.  Th1 cells also release #interleukin-2#, which activates and expands the population of naïve T cells, Th1 cells, and memory T cells. $#(Choice C)#  Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common cause of pneumonia in patients who are hospitalized in the intensive care unit or those with structural lung disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  It is an extracellular pathogen primarily combated by neutrophils and the humoral immune response. $#Educational objective# Intracellular bacterial organisms such as Legionella pneumophila are primarily countered by the cell-mediated immune response.  Intracellular pathogens that replicate within phagosomes (eg, Legionella, Mycobacterium tuberculosis) trigger activation and differentiation of T-helper subtype 1 cells with subsequent macrophage activation via interferon-gamma.

  "explanation_2": "#Malaria# is transmitted when an infected female Anopheles mosquito injects Plasmodium sporozoites into a human during a bite.  The sporozoites travel through the bloodstream to the liver, where they infect hepatocytes and mature into schizonts.  Within days to a few weeks, liver schizonts rupture the hepatocytes, releasing thousands of merozoites into the bloodstream. $Merozoites from different species of malaria have different affinities for erythrocytes.  Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale primarily infect very young, large erythrocytes recently released from the bone marrow (ie, reticulocytes), whereas Plasmodium malariae primarily infects old erythrocytes that have been in the bloodstream for months.  In contrast, #Plasmodium falciparum# has the unique ability to infect #erythrocytes of all ages#. $Because P falciparum can target a much larger pool of erythrocytes, patients infected with this species typically have much #greater levels of parasitemia# than those infected with other species.  In addition, P falciparum has a unique ability to significantly increase cytoadherence molecules on the surface of infected erythrocytes, leading to increased risk for microvascular adhesion with subsequent tissue ischemia.  The combination of a high degree of parasitemia and a high risk for #microvascular adhesion# make P falciparum the most severe and deadly species of malaria. $#(Choice A)#  All Plasmodium species that cause malaria rely primarily on anaerobic metabolism because they are unable to perform oxidative phosphorylation in their mitochondria.  Parasite anaerobic glycolysis likely contributes to the hypoglycemia and acidosis (eg, lactic acidosis) typically seen in severe malaria. $#(Choice B)#  All Plasmodium species that cause malaria digest hemoglobin in vacuoles to supply the parasite with amino acids.  This generates hemozoin, a toxic metabolite identified by macrophages in the reticuloendothelial system, leading to erythrocyte pruning and, often, splenomegaly. $#(Choice D)#  Although most strains of P falciparum are resistant to chloroquine due to point mutations in the chloroquine resistance transporter protein, this does not account for the high degree of parasitemia seen with P falciparum infections. $#(Choice E)#  P vivax and P ovale develop a dormant form in the liver that can reactivate months or a few years later.  This is not a feature of P falciparum and does not contribute to the high degree of parasitemia seen with this species. $#Educational objective# Plasmodium falciparum can achieve much higher levels of parasitemia than other species of malaria due to its ability to infect erythrocytes of all ages.

Those who are colonized and do not receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis can transmit the bacteria to the fetus during passage through the vaginal canal, leading to neonatal sepsis (eg, irritability, lethargy, grunting, tachypnea, temperature instability, hypotension) within hours of birth. $GBS is a leading cause of #early neonatal sepsis# and can be identified by the following laboratory features: $• #Narrow zone of beta-hemolysis# (clear) when plated on blood agar. $• #Production of CAMP factor#, a phospholipase that enhances the activity of beta-hemolysins secreted by certain strains of Staphylococcus aureus.  Testing for CAMP factor #(CAMP test)# can confirm the presence of GBS; this test plates suspected GBS colonies perpendicular to an appropriate S aureus strain and evaluates for enhanced areas of hemolysis (arrow-shaped zones in the image above). $GBS is also catalase-negative (as are all streptococci), contains the Lancefield group B antigen in its cell wall, and hydrolyzes hippurate. $#(Choice A)#  Escherichia coli, a gram-negative rod, is a common cause of early neonatal sepsis.  Although E coli generates beta-hemolysins, it does not produce CAMP factor; therefore, enhancement of S aureus hemolysis does not occur. $#(Choice B)#  Enterococcus faecalis, a gram-positive cocci, is a common cause of sepsis in preterm neonates but is rare in those born at term.  In addition, it does not hemolyze red blood cells (gamma hemolytic) or generate camp factor. $#(Choice C)#  Staphylococcus epidermidis, a gram-positive coccus that grows in clusters, is a common skin commensal that does not cause hemolysis when plated on blood agar. $#(Choice E)#  Streptococcus pneumoniae, a lancet-shaped, gram-positive bacterium, is alpha-hemolytic (partial, green hemolysis) in aerobic conditions and beta-hemolytic in anaerobic conditions.  It does not generate CAMP factor. $#Educational objective# Streptococcus agalactiae (group B Streptococcus), one of the most common causes of early neonatal sepsis, is typically identified by the presence of a narrow zone of beta-hemolysis when plated on blood agar.

Treponemal tests evaluate for #antibodies that directly target T pallidum#; patient serum is mixed with killed T pallidum to evaluate for antibody adherence using immunofluorescence.  Patients with positive nontreponemal and treponemal tests are considered infected with syphilis. $#(Choice A)#  Lyme disease is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi.  Patients with early Lyme disease often develop flulike symptoms and a bull's-eye rash (not a diffuse maculopapular rash).  Serologic testing for IgM/IgG against Borrelia can aid in the diagnosis as the disease progresses. $#(Choice B)#  Rheumatoid factor is an antibody that targets the Fc portion of IgG.  Elevations are often seen in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases. $#(Choice C)#  Histoplasma capsulatum infection can be diagnosed by examining urine and serum for fungal antigens.  Histoplasma infections usually present with prominent pulmonary manifestations rather than diffuse rash and lymphadenopathy. $#(Choice D)#  Antimitochondrial antibodies are present in >95% of cases of primary biliary cholangitis, which usually causes fatigue, pruritus, hepatomegaly, and elevated alkaline phosphatase.  This patient's systemic maculopapular rash and diffuse lymphadenopathy make syphilis more likely. $#Educational objective# Syphilis is caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum.  Confirmation of the diagnosis requires 2 forms of serologic testing to prevent false-positive results.  Nontreponemal tests (eg, rapid plasma reagin, VDRL) evaluate for anticardiolipin antibodies (nonspecific); treponemal tests evaluate for antibodies targeted against T pallidum.  ",

Transmission occurs when an infected female Anopheles mosquito injects the parasite while blood feeding.  To prevent infection, travelers to @malaria-endemic regions@ should be counseled on mosquito-avoidance measures and given chemoprophylaxis. $#Mosquito avoidance# strategies include staying indoors at dawn/dusk (when mosquitos are most active), wearing insect repellant, limiting exposed skin, and sleeping within insecticide-treated nets.  #Chemoprophylaxis# targets the predominant species of the region and considers the presence of drug resistance.

  "explanation_2": "The serologic markers for hepatitis B infection appear on a predictable timeline with a long asymptomatic incubation period (lasting an average of 6-8 weeks) followed by acute disease lasting several weeks to months.  HBsAg first appears before the onset of symptoms, peaks when the patient is most ill, and then becomes undetectable in 3-6 months (unless the disease progresses to a chronic phase).  Shortly after HBsAg first appears, HBeAg and HBV DNA can be detected in the serum and are markers of active viral replication.  Anti-HBcAg IgM and elevated serum transaminases appear shortly before symptom onset.  Over the next few months, the anti-HBcAg IgM component is replaced with an IgG component.  Anti-HBeAg appears shortly after HBeAg vanishes and suggests subsiding viral activity (transition from high viral replication/infectivity to low viral replication/infectivity).  Anti-HBsAg IgG arises once the acute disease has resolved (unless the disease progresses to a chronic phase), and is typically not detectable until weeks or months after HBsAg has disappeared.  This antibody may persist indefinitely, conferring lifelong immunity. $Given this serologic marker graph, it appears that this patient has a persistence of HBsAg and HBeAg over a long period with low to moderate levels of anti-HBcAg IgG and no detectable Anti-HBsAg.  These findings are suggestive of an acute hepatitis B infection that has not resolved, but rather has progressed to a highly infectious chronic hepatitis B (note the persistence of HBeAg and lack of anti-HBeAg). $#(Choice A)#  Were this patient to have fully recovered from his bout of acute hepatitis B, all antigens should have dropped to undetectable levels and he should have high levels of anti-HBsAg IgG and anti-HBcAg IgG. $#(Choice B)#  An exacerbation of preexisting hepatitis B would be characterized by a decline followed by a spike in antigen levels. $#(Choice C)#  Acute hepatitis B that progressed to chronic hepatitis with low infectivity would be indicated by a graph similar to the one shown for this patient.  However, there would be low or undetectable levels of HBeAg (the marker for high infectivity) and likely detectable quantities of anti-HBeAg. $#(Choice E)#  Vaccination against HBV would be identified by a surge in anti-HBsAb with no anti-HBcAg, anti-HBeAg, or viral antigens detected. $#Educational objective# If HBeAg persists for several months and host anti-HBeAg remain at low or undetectable levels, suspect chronic hepatitis B infection with high infectivity.

Nonspecific neonatal findings of jaundice and hepatosplenomegaly are often present; #diffuse intracranial calcifications# are the classic finding on imaging. $Parasitic spread of Toxoplasma begins via infected cats (host), which excrete oocysts that contaminate soil and water.  Humans typically acquire the infection due to either of the following: $• Incidental ingestion of oocysts from #cat feces# (eg, handling kitty litter, consuming unwashed produce) $• Consumption of #undercooked meat# from farm animals that ingested oocysts and developed tissue infection $Ingestion of contaminated meat is the most common method of spread in pregnancy.  Therefore, although maternal infection is often asymptomatic, pregnant women are advised to #avoid# raw, cured, and undercooked meat to reduce the risk of infection and transplacental transmission to the fetus. $#(Choice A)#  Preconception maternal immunization with the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine can prevent congenital rubella infection.  Characteristic features of congenital rubella include hearing loss, cataracts (cloudy cornea), and cardiac defects (eg, patent ductus arteriosus), none of which are seen in this patient.  Moreover, retinal lesions and hydrocephalus are uncommon, and rubella is a virus, not a crescent-shaped, intracellular parasite. $#(Choice C)#  Pregnant women should avoid, not preferentially consume, unpasteurized milk products, primarily to prevent congenital Listeria monocytogenes infection, which can lead to multiorgan abscesses or fetal demise.  Although rare, Toxoplasma and other pathogens can also spread through raw milk. $#(Choice D)#  Malaria, a parasitic infection transmitted by mosquitoes, can cause intrauterine infection, but infants with congenital malaria typically present with fever and anemia, not hydrocephalus and chorioretinitis.  In addition, although Plasmodium falciparum is a crescent-shaped intracellular organism, placental biopsy would show intervillous accumulation of parasitized red blood cells without calcifications. $#(Choice E)#  Prophylactic penicillin is used during labor to prevent group B Streptococcus (GBS) transmission to the fetus during delivery.  Infection typically leads to early neonatal sepsis (eg, lethargy, hypoxia, temperature instability), findings not seen in this patient.  Moreover, in contrast to this patient's pathologic findings, GBS is a gram-positive coccus that forms chains. $#Educational objective# Pregnant women should avoid consumption of undercooked meat to prevent infection with Toxoplasma gondii, an intracellular, crescent-shaped parasite that can cross the placenta to the fetus.

  "explanation_2": "This patient's opportunistic infection (oropharyngeal/esophageal candidiasis), positive HIV immunoassay testing, and low CD4 count suggest a diagnosis of #AIDS#.  However, she has no detectable HIV-1 RNA in her bloodstream.  Although HIV-1 causes most cases of AIDS worldwide (and nearly all cases in the United States), AIDS can also be due to infection with #HIV-2#, which is endemic to #West Africa# (eg, Senegal). $Patients infected with HIV-2 have much #lower levels of viremia# than those infected with HIV-1.  Because viremia is directly correlated with transmission risk, rate of CD4 count decline, and progression to AIDS, individuals with HIV-2 are usually less infectious and have #longer asymptomatic periods# than patients with HIV-1.  The diagnosis of HIV-2 is often suspected when #HIV test results are incongruent#; most patients will have the following laboratory results: $• #Positive fourth-generation HIV testing# (HIV antigen/antibody test) – This test evaluates for the presence of p24 antigen and HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies but does not usually differentiate between HIV-1 and HIV-2. $• #Indeterminate or negative HIV-1 confirmatory testing# – HIV-1 Western blot evaluates for proteins in HIV-1 and is usually indeterminate in the setting of HIV-2 infection.  Plasma HIV-1 RNA testing will be negative. $Confirmation of HIV-2 infection can be made using an HIV-1/HIV-2 differentiation immunoassay.  Treatment with antiretroviral therapy is required to prevent HIV-2 disease progression.  However, nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and fusion inhibitors must be avoided because HIV-2 is intrinsically resistant to these HIV medications. $#(Choice A)#  False-positive HIV serology can be seen in the setting of cross-reacting antibodies due to pregnancy, rheumatic disease, and malignancy.  Although patients with cross-reacting antibodies have negative plasma HIV RNA, they would not have low CD4 counts or an AIDS-defining illness (eg, esophageal thrush). $#(Choice B)#  HIV attacks host cells by @binding@ to the host CD4 receptor and CCR5 (or CXCR4) chemokine coreceptor.  Homozygous deletion to CCR5 usually prevents HIV infection because the virus is not able to enter host cells; these individuals would not typically develop low CD4 count or signs of AIDS. $#(Choice C)#  X4 strains of HIV-1 use the chemokine receptor CXCR4 as a coreceptor during viral entry into host cells.  Patients who are infected with X4 strains have positive plasma HIV-1 RNA. $#(Choice E)#  The window period occurs during early HIV infection when serologic testing and antigen testing for HIV are not yet positive.  This patient had positive HIV antigen/antibody testing; therefore, she is not in the window period. $#Educational objective# Most cases of AIDS worldwide are caused by HIV-1.  However, AIDS can also be caused by infection with HIV-2, which is endemic to West Africa.  HIV-2 infection is associated with lower viral loads, less risk of transmission, and a slower progression to AIDS.  The diagnosis is often suspected when HIV tests are incongruent (positive screening serology but indeterminate Western blot and negative plasma HIV-1 RNA).  Confirmation can be made using HIV-1/HIV-2 immunodifferentiation assay.  ",

  "explanation_2": "#Bacillus anthracis# is a gram-positive, sporulating bacterium that primarily affects herbivores (eg, sheep, cows) that graze on contaminated pastures.  However, transmission to humans can occasionally occur due to inhalation, ingestion, or cutaneous inoculation of B anthracis spores.  Risk is greatest in those who handle contaminated hides, animal hair (eg, wool), or carcasses.  Cutaneous exposure usually results in a painless papule that rapidly ulcerates and subsequently turns into a black eschar. $B anthracis spores germinate at tissue temperatures into vegetative rods that have 2 main virulence factors: $• A #polypeptide capsule# composed of poly-γ-D-glutamic acid, which inhibits phagocytosis $• A #trimeric exotoxin# composed of protective antigen, edema factor, and lethal factor $Protective antigen binds to a host cell membrane receptor on macrophages and forms a channel that delivers lethal factor and edema factor into the cell.  Lethal factor is a zinc metalloproteinase that inhibits MAP kinase signal transduction, leading to cell death.  Edema factor is a #calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase# that increases cyclic AMP concentration, leading to accumulation of fluid within/between cells and suppression of neutrophil and macrophage function. $The mechanism of action of edema factor is very similar to that of the #adenylate cyclase toxin# produced by #Bordetella pertussis#.  Adenylate cyclase toxin is also a calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase that increases cAMP concentration, leading to edema and phagocyte dysfunction.  This results in localized immunosuppression that allows B pertussis to colonize the respiratory tract.  The other major B pertussis exotoxin is pertussis toxin, which increases cAMP concentration via ADP-ribosylation of a membrane G-protein. $#(Choices B and C)#  Both Clostridium botulinum and C difficile are sporulating bacteria whose vegetative forms generate exotoxins.  However, the exotoxins produced by these bacteria operate by different mechanisms than edema factor or lethal factor.  Botulinum toxin is an endopeptidase that blocks neuromuscular cholinergic transmission; toxins A and B (generated by C difficile) inactivate Rho family proteins, leading to a derangement of cytoskeletal structure and guanosine triphosphate signal transduction. $#(Choice D)#  Shigella dysenteriae invades colonic mucosal cells and produces Shiga toxin, an exotoxin that cleaves a peptide off the 60S ribosomal subunit and causes irreversible inhibition of protein synthesis. $#(Choice E)#  Streptococcus pyogenes strains that have been exposed to a specific lysogenic bacteriophage produce pyrogenic exotoxins, which cause scarlet fever and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome.  These exotoxins are proteases that degrade host cell proteins or nonspecifically activate T cells (superantigens). $#Educational objective# Bacillus anthracis edema factor is an adenylate cyclase that increases intracellular cyclic AMP, leading to neutrophil and macrophage dysfunction and tissue edema.  This mechanism of action is similar to that of adenylate cyclase toxin, produced by Bordetella pertussis.  "

  "explanation_2": "This patient with rapidly progressive systemic symptoms, generalized lymphadenopathy, and an enlarged, painful lymph node likely has #bubonic plague#, an infection caused by the gram-negative bacillus/coccobacillus #Yersinia pestis#.  This highly virulent pathogen is endemic to areas of North and South America, Asia, Africa, and Russia.  It is primarily transmitted by #rodent fleas#. $Manifestations begin with rapidly progressive fever, chills, weakness, and headache.  #Painful regional lymphadenopathy# develops concurrently or within a few days; lymph nodes #swell#, develop overlying erythema, and often drain #purulent fluid# (buboes).  When left untreated, plague progresses to sepsis with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); the disease is sometimes called \"black death\" due to tissue necrosis from DIC. $The most common first-line treatment for plague is an #aminoglycoside#.  This class of antibiotic #prevents bacterial protein synthesis# by binding with high affinity to the #30S ribosomal subunit#.  Aminoglycosides have particular potency against the Enterobacteriaceae family, Francisella tularensis, and Y pestis. $#(Choice A)#  Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole blocks bacterial dihydrofolate formation and reduction, which inhibits the generation of purine nucleic acids for DNA synthesis and repair.  Although trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole can be used for plague, it is not a first-line therapy due to overall low efficacy (mortality rate 20-30%). $#(Choice C)#  Penicillin agents inhibit the bacterial enzyme transpeptidase, which catalyzes the final cross-linking step in @peptidoglycan elongation@.  Although penicillin antibiotics are often administered with gentamicin to treat infection with gram-positive organisms (penicillin disrupts the cell wall so gentamicin can enter the cytoplasm), Y pestis is a gram-negative pathogen; therefore, penicillins are not helpful. $#(Choice D)#  Azole antibiotics inhibit the fungal enzyme 14 alpha-demethylase, which helps generate ergosterol.  Ergosterol is a crucial component of the cell membrane of yeasts.  Bacteria would be unaffected by inhibition of this fungal enzyme. $#(Choice E)#  Vancomycin binds to the D-alanyl–D-alanine terminus of peptidoglycan, which blocks transpeptidase from elongating the peptidoglycan chain.  Although vancomycin is sometimes used for streptococcal or staphylococcal adenitis, it has no efficacy against gram-negative pathogens. $#Educational objective# Yersinia pestis, the cause of bubonic plague, is transmitted primarily by rodent fleas.

  "explanation_2": "This patient's acute febrile illness with tender, erythematous inguinal lymphadenopathy likely indicates #bubonic plague#, a zoonotic infection endemic to North/South America, Africa, Asia, and Russia.  The causative pathogen is #Yersinia pestis#, a small gram-negative bacillus/coccobacillus that exhibits #bipolar staining# (resembling a safety pin) on Giemsa or Wright stain.  Although many small mammals harbor the bacteria, #rodents# (eg, rats) are the primary environmental reservoir.  Transmission most often occurs when a #flea# that fed on an infected rodent regurgitates the bacteria while biting a human.  Therefore, the most likely source of this patient's infection is close contact with rodent-infested areas (eg, changing #rodent traps#). $After cutaneous inoculation, Y pestis travels via lymphatic channels to regional lymph nodes and triggers a significant inflammatory reaction.  Manifestations typically begin with acute fever, chills, weakness, and headache; #buboes# (painful, swollen, erythematous lymph nodes) develop shortly thereafter.  Prompt treatment with an antibiotic (eg, aminoglycoside) is generally curative. $#(Choices A and F)#  Brucellosis most often develops following consumption of unpasteurized animal products (eg, sheep milk) or contact with infected animals (eg, cattle, pigs, sheep, goats).  Manifestations (eg, fever, night sweats, arthralgias) progress slowly and are often nonspecific, but painful regional lymphadenitis would be atypical; in addition, microscopic examination would reveal small, intracellular gram-negative rods. $#(Choice B)#  The handling of animal hides can transmit anthrax, which often causes systemic symptoms and regional lymphadenitis.  However, patients usually have a large necrotic skin ulcer with central eschar and surrounding erythema at the inoculation site.  In addition, Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent, is a gram-positive, spore-forming rod. $#(Choice C)#  Hunting and skinning small mammals (eg, rabbits, squirrels) is a common cause of tularemia, which often presents with painful regional lymphadenitis and fever.  However, patients usually develop a papular lesion at the inoculation site that ulcerates.  Although Francisella tularensis, the causative pathogen, is also a gram-negative coccobacillus, it is not associated with bipolar staining. $#(Choice D)#  Cleaning a chicken coop can transmit Histoplasma capsulatum, a dimorphic fungus that primarily resides in soil contaminated with bird or bat droppings.  Most cases present with pulmonary infiltrates, mediastinal/hilar lymphadenopathy, and systemic symptoms.  Regional lymphadenitis would be uncommon; in addition, the organism is a fungus, not a coccobacillus. $#Educational objective# Bubonic plague causes a febrile illness with regional inflammatory lymphadenopathy (buboes).

The diagnosis of #gastrointestinal tract infection# is made by inspecting the stool for eggs; treatment with antiparasitic drugs (eg, albendazole) is generally curative. $#(Choice A)#  Rheumatic fever is associated with the formation of cross-reacting antibodies to renal, neuronal, and cardiac antigens following group A Streptococcus pharyngitis.  Eggs would not be seen in stool. $#(Choice B)#  Hypersensitivity pneumonitis, an immune reaction to an inhaled agent, can occur following exposure to mold dust or spores.  Patients generally develop acute fever, nausea, cough, and dyspnea.  However, wheezing is uncommon, and eggs would not be shed in stool. $#(Choice C)#  Chagas disease, a parasitic infection caused by @Trypanosoma cruzi@, can cause myopericarditis during acute infection.  However, cardiac and gastrointestinal manifestations are much more likely to occur years or decades later.  In addition, T cruzi is not shed in stool; it can sometimes be visualized on blood smear. $#(Choice E)#  Type IV hypersensitivity reactions are mediated by T cells and are often seen as part of certain drug reactions (eg, Stevens-Johnson syndrome).  In contrast, Ascaris infections are associated with IgE-mediated (eosinophilic) hypersensitivity. $#Educational objective# Ascaris lumbricoides is transmitted via contaminated food or water.  Eggs hatch into larvae in the small intestine, penetrate the intestinal wall, and migrate across the lung into the alveoli.  Larvae are subsequently coughed up and swallowed into the gastrointestinal tract, where they mature to adult worms.  Most patients are asymptomatic, but some develop early pulmonary manifestations (Loeffler syndrome) or later gastrointestinal symptoms.  ",

Injury to these cells dramatically #increases the risk of infection# due to: $• #Mucositis:#  Damage to rapidly dividing epithelial cells of the digestive tract creates breaches in the mucosal barrier that allow #endogenous bacterial flora# (commensal organisms) to penetrate and enter the bloodstream.  Gram-negative enteric bacilli, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Gram-positive skin organisms, such as Staphylococcus epidermidis and S aureus, are most likely to invade. $• #Neutropenia:#  Damage to rapidly dividing granulopoietic cells reduces the circulating neutrophil count.  Because neutrophils serve as front-line defense against bacterial and fungal pathogens, commensal pathogens that penetrate the mucosal/cutaneous barrier cannot be contained and subsequently spread to the bloodstream and deeper tissues.  Neutropenic patients have weak inflammatory responses, and #fever# is often the #only sign of infection# (neutropenic fever). $To reduce the risk of serious infection, patients who receive systemic chemotherapy are often empirically treated with prophylactic antibiotics (eg, ciprofloxacin) to prevent commensal organisms from invading and with granulocyte-stimulating agents (eg, filgrastim) to increase neutrophil count. $#(Choice B)#  Hospital-acquired, drug-resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant S aureus, can cause neutropenic fever but do so much less often than endogenous commensal bacteria. $#(Choice C)#  Pathogens spread from infected contacts (eg, influenza) are more likely to cause severe infection in those with impaired immunity.  However, the greatest cause of neutropenic fever is endogenous bacterial flora. $#(Choice D)#  The reactivation of latent bacterial (eg, tuberculosis) and viral (eg, cytomegalovirus) pathogens is common in those with sustained impairments to cellular immunity (eg, AIDS, immunosuppression following transplantation, immunotherapy for rheumatologic conditions).  Neutropenia following chemotherapy is typically transient; the majority of infections in this setting are due to the invasion of commensal bacteria through damaged gastrointestinal epithelium.  Reactivation of latent viral or bacterial infections can occur but is far less common. $#(Choice E)#  Vector-borne and zoonotic organisms are not a primary cause of neutropenic fever in patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy.  These pathogens are common in travelers to developing nations. $#Educational objective# Chemotherapy-associated neutropenic fever is most often caused by endogenous commensal bacteria that have translocated across damaged mucosal sites.

Tenofovir is a common part of first-line HIV therapy.  It is an adenosine analogue that is a member of the #nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors# (NRTIs).  NRTIs prevent reverse transcriptase from converting the HIV RNA genome into complementary double-stranded DNA, which inhibits viral replication. $Tenofovir is primarily eliminated via the proximal tubule cells of the kidney.  High concentrations of tenofovir in these cells can interfere with mitochondrial DNA synthesis and result in cellular damage.

Patients may have proteinuria, edema, hypertension, and/or acute kidney injury.  However, they usually also have red/brown urine and biopsy evidence of diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis. $#(Choice E)#  Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is often used in patients with advanced AIDS to prevent Pneumocystis pneumonia and/or Toxoplasma gondii.  It can cause interstitial nephritis and acute kidney injury but does not usually cause focal damage to the proximal tubule. $#Educational objective# Tenofovir is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor that is a common component of HIV therapy.

S epidermidis is adept at causing foreign body infections because of its ability to form biofilms. $Once introduced into the body, foreign bodies quickly become coated with a layer of host proteins, including fibrinogen and fibronectin.  These proteins then serve as binding sites for S epidermidis.  After attachment occurs, the bacteria multiply and communicate with one another to induce synthesis of an extracellular polysaccharide matrix that encases the bacteria.  The resulting biofilm functions as a barrier to antibiotic penetration and interferes with host defenses, including opsonization, neutrophil migration, and even T lymphocyte activation.  Once mature, these biofilms can disperse individual pathogen \"seeds\" (planktonic cells) into the bloodstream and surrounding areas, further disseminating the infection.

BSI should be suspected when a patient with an intravascular catheter develops new-onset fever or bacteremia. $#(Choice A)#  Although S aureus is a leading cause of infective endocarditis in patients with artificial heart valves, bacteremia is much more commonly caused by intravascular devices. $#(Choice B)#  The increased use of broad-spectrum antibiotics is associated with the development of drug-resistant organisms, including methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA).  Although MRSA is a common cause of skin abscess and necrotizing pneumonia, the majority of S aureus bacteremia is caused by intravascular catheters. $#(Choice C)#  Injection drug use is a major risk factor for S aureus abscess, bacteremia, and infective endocarditis.  However, injection drug use causes far fewer BSIs than intravenous catheters. $#(Choice D)#  Immunosuppression increases the risk of BSI due to reduced immunosurveillance.  However, BSI is far more often due to the use of intravascular catheters. $#(Choice E)#  Indwelling urinary catheters increase the risk of urinary infection with subsequent hematogenous spread of the organism.  However, most cases are caused by gram-negative enteric organisms such as E coli. $#Educational objective# Nosocomial bloodstream infections are usually associated with intravascular catheters, which allow skin commensals such as Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci to enter the bloodstream.

  "explanation_2": "#Corynebacterium diphtheriae# are nonmotile, unencapsulated, gram-positive rods.  On microscopic examination, they are often found in clumps (classically said to resemble Chinese characters) or joined in V- or Y-shaped chains.  Their cytoplasm contains metachromatic #granules# that stain with #aniline# dyes (eg, methylene blue). $C diphtheriae produce classic 2-subunit #AB exotoxin#.  The B (binding) subunit binds specifically to the heparin-binding epidermal growth factor receptor on cardiac and neural cells, which explains the toxin's affinity for heart and brain tissue.  The B subunit induces endocytosis of the toxin, and the subsequently released A (active) subunit inhibits host cell protein synthesis by catalyzing the ADP-ribosylation of protein elongation factor 2 (EF-2).  EF-2 is necessary for tRNA to insert new amino acids into the growing protein chain during translation.  Therefore, the toxin causes cell death by inhibiting cell protein synthesis. $#(Choice A)#  Certain virulent enteric bacteria (eg, Campylobacter jejuni, Vibrio cholerae) release AB exotoxins that activate electrolyte transport.  These toxins have 5 B subunits responsible for cell binding and toxin endocytosis and 1 A subunit that stimulates a G protein to increase intracellular cAMP concentrations.  As a result, active efflux of sodium and chloride ions occurs, and the subsequent cell water loss into the gut lumen leads to watery diarrhea and dehydration. $#(Choice B)#  Botulinum toxin is a neurotoxin that blocks exocytosis of acetylcholine-containing presynaptic vesicles from peripheral nerve terminals, causing cranial and peripheral nerve palsies, muscle weakness, and respiratory paralysis.  Tetanus toxin inhibits the release of the inhibitory neurotransmitters gamma-aminobutyric acid and glycine.  Classic manifestations of tetanus include muscle spasms and autonomic hyperactivity. $#(Choice C)#  Clostridium perfringens releases a cytolytic toxin (alpha-toxin, or phospholipase C) that degrades cell membrane phospholipids, causing cell destruction. $#(Choice E)#  Superantigens (eg, staphylococcal and streptococcal toxic shock toxins) bind nonspecifically to T cell receptors and major histocompatibility complex class II molecules on antigen-presenting cells, leading to widespread T cell stimulation and inflammation.  However, they are classically implicated in toxic shock syndrome related to tampon use or nasal packing, not upper respiratory infections. $#Educational objective# Diphtheria exotoxin inhibits host cell protein synthesis by catalyzing the ADP-ribosylation of host cell elongation factor-2.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient with positive #Escherichia coli# blood cultures has altered mental status, hypotension, and tachycardia, findings consistent with #septic shock#. $Pathogenesis of sepsis and septic shock caused by gram-negative bacteria (eg, E coli) involves the release of #bacterial endotoxins# into the bloodstream, which induce a massive release of inflammatory cytokines.  The most potent endotoxin of gram-negative bacteria is #lipopolysaccharide# (LPS), a heat-stable component in the outer membrane that is released with destruction of the bacterial cell wall or during cell division. $The major virulence component of LPS is #lipid A#, which is located on the inner portion of the molecule and provides an anchor into the cell membrane.  It activates toll-like receptors on innate immune cells (eg, macrophages), triggering the release of endogenous pyrogens (eg, IL-1, IL-6, prostaglandins) and inflammatory mediators (eg, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon).  These cytokines disrupt endothelial cells and increase vascular permeability, resulting in profound hypotension and end-organ dysfunction/failure. $#(Choices A and C)#  Core polysaccharide and O antigen are also components of LPS.  However, core polysaccharide, which contains a short chain of sugars that differs among bacteria, is not involved in the virulence of LPS.  Similarly, O antigen is a variable polysaccharide on the outer surface and is a target for recognition by the host immune system but is not directly responsible for the manifestations of septic shock. $#(Choice D)#  Peptidoglycan is a component of the bacterial cell wall that provides structural integrity and protection from environmental forces (eg, osmotic stress).  Peptidoglycan does not play a role in the development of gram-negative septic shock. $#(Choice E)#  Many gram-negative bacteria (including E coli) have surface lipoproteins (SLPs), or proteins attached to a lipid anchor, projecting from the inner or outer membrane.  These SLPs help move nutrients into the cell and facilitate immune evasion but are not responsible for causing septic shock. $#Educational objective# Pathogenesis of Escherichia coli sepsis involves the release of lipopolysaccharide (ie, endotoxin) from bacterial cells.

L monocytogenes is a motile, #facultatively intracellular# organism with several unique adaptations that allow it to evade the host immune response, including the following: $• #Listeriolysin O#:  This major virulence factor generates #pores in phagosome# membranes, which allows phagocytosed L monocytogenes to #escape into the cytoplasm# of monocytes and avoid lysosomal destruction. $• #Actin#-#based transcellular spread#:  The organism hijacks the actin-based cellular motility mechanism of host cells, which allows it to spread to adjacent cells without reentering the extracellular space.  This significantly reduces exposure of L monocytogenes to antibodies and phagocytic cells. $Because of these adaptations, antibody- and phagocyte-mediated destruction of the pathogen is impaired; therefore, infections are controlled primarily by the cytotoxic T-cell response. $Most L monocytogenes infections occur in #pregnant women# in the third trimester.  Although antibiotics are curative, L monocytogenes quickly invades the placenta and may cause fetal death, premature birth, and neonatal infection. $#(Choice B)#  Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin) is the major component of the cell wall in gram-negative, not gram-positive, bacteria (some sources erroneously report that L monocytogenes contains lipopolysaccharide).  Endotoxin activates complement, coagulation, and fibrinolysis, which can lead to septic shock and disseminated intravascular coagulation. $#(Choice C)#  Clostridium botulinum, an anaerobic gram-positive rod, produces an exotoxin (botulinum toxin) that inhibits the synaptic transmission of motor neurons.  Patients typically develop descending, symmetric motor deficits; minimal sensory changes; and no fever. $#(Choice D)#  Pathogenic strains of Corynebacterium diphtheriae produce an exotoxin that inhibits elongation factor in host cells, which causes pseudomembranous pharyngitis and myocarditis.  Although C diphtheriae is a gram-positive rod, it does not cause febrile gastroenteritis. $#Educational objective# Listeria monocytogenes is a facultative intracellular, gram-positive rod that most often causes febrile gastroenteritis.  Pathogenesis is mediated largely by listeriolysin O, an enzyme that creates pores in phagosomes, which allows the bacteria to escape lysosomal destruction.

Exposure primarily occurs when humans inadvertently inhale the organism during #recreational water activities# such as swimming, diving, or using hot springs.  Most individuals do not become ill, but a minority develop fatal meningoencephalitis after N fowleri penetrates the olfactory mucosa, crosses the cribriform plate, and invades the olfactory bulb. $Patients with PAM usually develop acute confusion, high fever, photophobia, and meningeal symptoms (eg, neck stiffness, headache).

  "explanation_2": "$Microscopy of this patient's penis ulcer reveals a #multinucleated giant cell# with ground-glass intranuclear inclusions, raising strong suspicion for #herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection#.  Genital HSV is usually caused by HSV type 2, which is spread primarily via direct skin contact with herpetic sores or infected genital secretions during sexual activity.  Initial infection is often characterized by #painful genital ulcers#, fever, lymphadenopathy, and dysuria.  Symptoms typically resolve within a few weeks, but latent infection develops in the sacral dorsal root ganglia and can periodically reactivate, leading to recurrence. $HSV is generally diagnosed by cell culture or PCR, but #Tzanck smear# (as seen above) can reveal the cytopathic effects of the virus (eg, @multinucleated giant cells@, acantholytic cells, keratinocyte ballooning, nuclear molding).  Oral antiviral agents such as #acyclovir#, a competitive inhibitor of viral DNA polymerase, help speed symptom resolution. $#(Choice B)#  Azithromycin can be used to treat chancroid, which is characterized by the formation of a papule that evolves into a pustule and then an ulcer.  However, it is very rare in the United States and is caused by the gram-negative organism Haemophilus ducreyi; multinucleated giant cells would not be seen. $#(Choice C)#  Doxycycline can treat lymphogranuloma venereum, a genital infection caused by certain serotypes of Chlamydia trachomatis.  This disease is marked by the formation of a small genital ulcer, followed by significant lymph node inflammation and pain in the inguinal or femoral region.  C trachomatis appears as intravacuolar organisms in macrophages. $#(Choice D)#  Fluconazole can treat @Candida@ balanitis, which is typically marked by a painful, pruritic, erythematous rash.  Yeasts and pseudohyphae can often be seen on microscopy. $#(Choice E)#  Penicillin can be used to treat syphilis, a spirochetal infection caused by Treponema pallidum that begins with the formation of a chancre (painless ulcer with heaped-up borders and a clean base) at the site of inoculation.  Diagnosis is generally made with serologic testing because T pallidum cannot be cultured; multiple ulcers and multinucleated giant cells are not typically seen. $#(Choice F)#  Permethrin can be used to treat pubic lice, which are associated with significant pruritus of hairy genital areas.  Lice can generally be visualized on the hair shaft. $#Educational objective# Herpes simplex virus is a common, sexually transmitted infection marked by the formation of painful genital ulcers.

SA residues also inhibit binding of the opsonin C3b (limits opsonophagocytosis) and the generation of the anaphylatoxin C5a (limits immune cell recruitment). $#(Choice A)#  Antigenic variation involves rapid mutation of surface antigens, which limits the ability of immunoglobulin formed during previous infection to prevent future infections.  It is seen primarily with viruses (eg, influenza) and certain bacteria (eg, Neisseria meningitidis); however, GBS is virulent primarily due to SA on its capsule, not antigenic variation. $#(Choice B)#  Catalase-producing organisms (eg, Listeria, Staphylococcus) can break down hydrogen peroxide to oxygen and water, which limits oxidative damage.

Stool culture is diagnostic. $#(Choice A)#  Clostridioides difficile infection most commonly causes profuse, watery diarrhea.  This diagnosis is rare without risk factors, such as recent antibiotic use or hospitalization, neither of which is seen in this patient. $#(Choice B)#  Clostridium perfringens gastroenteritis, which typically occurs after ingestion of contaminated food (particularly meat) that was inadequately cooked or refrigerated, causes watery, not bloody, diarrhea. $#(Choice C)#  Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli infection is a common cause of watery diarrhea, particularly in resource-limited countries (travelers' diarrhea).  In contrast, this patient has bloody diarrhea and no travel history outside the United States. $#(Choice D)#  In contrast to nontyphoidal Salmonella gastroenteritis, which can cause bloody diarrhea, Salmonella serovar Typhi infection is most common in resource-limited countries.  It causes fever and bacteremia; abdominal pain with or without diarrhea is common but typically begins a week after initial symptoms.  This patient's acute-onset bloody diarrhea and lack of travel history make this diagnosis unlikely. $#Educational objective# Acute-onset bloody diarrhea is most commonly due to Escherichia coli O157:H7, Shigella, or Campylobacter infection.  Shigella infection also classically causes high fever and left-sided abdominal tenderness (due to rectosigmoid involvement) and often occurs in outbreaks (eg, day care center).  "

It is not known to be effective against HSV-2. $#(Choice D)#  Although condom use may prevent sexual transmission of HSV-2 (and therefore might have prevented this patient from acquiring his primary genital HSV-2 infection), it does not reduce the frequency of recurrence of genital herpes. $#(Choice E)#  A short (7-10 days) course of treatment with oral acyclovir during primary genital HSV infection usually reduces the duration of viral shedding, time for lesional healing, and local pain; however, it does not appear to alter recurrence rates. $#Educational objective# A new-onset genital vesicular rash with a positive Tzanck smear in a previously asymptomatic patient is suggestive of primary genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection due to HSV-2.  Recurrences of genital herpes can be reduced through daily treatment with oral valacyclovir, acyclovir, or famciclovir.  Condom use can help prevent a primary genital HSV infection but does not prevent reactivation of latent infection.  "

  "explanation_2": "#Norovirus# is the most common cause of #viral gastroenteritis#.  Symptoms include diarrhea, #vomiting#, fever, malaise, and headache.  The #diarrhea# is typically #watery without blood or mucus# due to lack of small bowel inflammation. $Norovirus (part of the Calicivirus family) possesses a linear, nonenveloped, single-stranded RNA genome.  It is resistant to inactivation by acid, bile, and pancreatic enzymes.  As a result, norovirus is easily transmitted via #fecal-oral spread# (eg, foodborne, person-to-person via contaminated bodily fluids) and results in #outbreaks# in crowded settings (eg, schools, hospitals, cruise ships, nursing homes).  The incubation period is 1-2 days; symptoms develop acutely and self-resolve within days.  The diagnosis is typically based solely on clinical presentation, but polymerase chain reaction testing may be performed to confirm an outbreak. $#(Choice A)#  Adenoviral gastroenteritis typically presents with fever and watery diarrhea.  Outbreaks can occur, but these are far less common than with norovirus.  Adenovirus more commonly causes pharyngoconjunctivitis and coryza (eg, runny nose, nasal congestion). $#(Choice B)#  Vomiting, high fever, and bloody diarrhea are typical of Campylobacter jejuni enteritis.  Transmission occurs via oral contact with contaminated food (eg, poultry) or drinks.  Outbreaks are not as common as those of viral etiology. $#(Choice C)#  Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile infection can result in asymptomatic carriers, pseudomembranous colitis, or fulminant colitis.  Patients have watery diarrhea with or without blood, abdominal pain, fever, and leukocytosis.  Prior antibiotic exposure (eg, fluoroquinolones, clindamycin) is the most significant risk factor. $#(Choice D)#  Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), the most common cause of traveler's diarrhea, is prevalent in developing countries.  Although the acute onset of nausea, vomiting, and watery nonbloody diarrhea is typical of ETEC infection, it would be unlikely in patients who have not traveled abroad recently. $#(Choice F)#  Gastroenteritis outbreaks can also occur with rotavirus infection, with a presentation similar to that of norovirus.  However, the prevalence of rotavirus in developed countries has decreased dramatically since the introduction of routine childhood vaccination.  Rotavirus is unlikely in vaccinated children (as in this case). $#(Choice G)#  Salmonella typhi infection can result in typhoid fever and presents with fever, followed by abdominal pain and diarrhea and/or constipation.  Severe complications (eg, hepatosplenomegaly, intestinal perforation, sepsis) occur in a minority of patients. $#Educational objective# Norovirus is the most common cause of viral gastroenteritis.

The presence of #oropharyngeal ulcers# and a diffuse #maculopapular rash# are important diagnostic clues. $Acute retroviral syndrome is associated with extremely #high levels of viral replication# (~5 million copies/mL) as the cell-mediated and humoral antibody response against the virus is not yet fully activated.  Therefore, laboratory results during this period usually show evidence of HIV in the plasma (positive viral load and p24 antigen) with a #negative serologic response# (negative HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody).  This is referred to as the \"#window period,#\" as patients are infected with HIV but HIV antibody screening tests may be negative (newer screening tests incorporate testing for HIV p24 antigen and are more sensitive in early infection). $The humoral response to HIV typically develops 6-8 weeks after initial infection.  At this time, anti-HIV antibodies in the serum neutralize circulating virus, which reduces viral load and leads to resolution of acute retroviral symptoms.  Most patients then enter a long asymptomatic period until diminished CD4 counts open the door to opportunistic infections. $#(Choice B)#  Antibodies against HIV surface glycoproteins (eg, gp120) help neutralize circulating virus and reduce viral load.  However, HIV surface glycoproteins display a high degree of antigenic variation, which prevents the formation of a completely effective antibody response. $#(Choices C and E)#  Patients with HIV develop immunosuppression primarily due to impairments in the cell-mediated immune response.  Although the humoral immune response is also impaired, patients are able to generate anti-HIV antibodies that partially neutralize the virus.  It is very rare that a patient with HIV will be too immunodeficient to seroconvert. $#(Choice D)#  Acute retroviral syndrome is marked by an extremely high rate of viral replication.  Although antibodies eventually form, the response is delayed because the humoral immune response takes several weeks to fully develop. $#Educational objective# Initial HIV infection is often associated with mononucleosis-like symptoms (eg, fever, lymphadenopathy, sore throat) 2-4 weeks after transmission.  Important diagnostic clues are oropharyngeal ulcers and a diffuse maculopapular rash.  As the humoral antibody response is not fully activated early in infection, laboratory results typically show HIV in the serum (positive viral load and p24 antigen) but negative HIV serology.  "

  "explanation_2": "This patient developed fever, headache, myalgia, and a maculopapular rash while camping in the Appalachian Mountains, raising strong suspicion for #Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever# (RMSF).  The causative pathogen is #Rickettsia rickettsii#, a weakly gram-negative, obligate intracellular bacterium.  Transmission occurs following a #tick bite# from specific tick vectors (eg, American dog tick) present in the eastern and south-central United States and mountainous regions west of the Mississippi River. $R rickettsii moves from the tick salivary glands to the human host after 6-12 hours of attachment.  The pathogen enters vascular endothelial cells via endocytosis and subsequently lyses the endosome using specific virulence factors.  It then replicates in the cytosol and nucleus of the host cell and spreads rapidly to adjacent cells via filopodia, leading to a lymphohistiocytic #vasculitis#. $Manifestations begin with fever, headache, myalgia, and malaise followed 3-5 days later by a characteristic macular #rash# that becomes petechial over time.  The rash typically begins on the ankles or wrists and spreads toward the center of the body (#centripetally#) as well as to the palms and soles.  #Thrombocytopenia #frequently occurs as platelets are consumed due to widespread vascular injury.  Antibiotic therapy is required to prevent progression and, potentially, death.  First-line therapy is #doxycycline#, which #inhibits protein synthesis# by binding the 30S bacterial ribosomal subunit. $#(Choice A)#  Fluoroquinolones prevent DNA gyrase and topoisomerase from unwinding bacterial double-stranded circular DNA.  Fluoroquinolones can be used to treat typhoid fever, a Salmonella infection that typically occurs in individuals who travel to developing nations.  Symptoms include a step-wise fever, salmon-colored rose spots on the trunk, and intestinal bleeding/perforation. $#(Choice B)#  Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole inhibits bacterial replication by blocking 2 successive steps in bacterial folate metabolism: Sulfamethoxazole competes with para-aminobenzoic acid in the synthesis of dihydrofolic acid, and trimethoprim inhibits dihydrofolate reductase. $#(Choice D)#  Azole medications inhibit fungal ergosterol synthesis, which disrupts fungal cell membranes.  Itraconazole can be used to treat pulmonary histoplasmosis, which usually causes subacute pneumonia with hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy. $#(Choice E)#  Penicillin medications inhibit peptidoglycan cross-linking, which disrupts bacterial (spirochetal) cell membranes.  Penicillin is the first-line therapy for syphilis, a spirochetal infection that can present with fever and a diffuse, symmetric maculopapular rash that involves the palms and soles (secondary syphilis).  However, patients typically have a mild (not high) fever and diffuse lymphadenopathy. $#(Choice F)#  Nucleotide and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors block @viral reverse transcription@.  Although acute retroviral syndrome (early HIV infection) can present with a diffuse maculopapular rash and fever, patients also often have diffuse lymphadenopathy, a sore throat, and painful oral ulcers.  In addition, RMSF is more likely in this case given this patient's recent camping trip. $#Educational objective# Rocky mountain spotted fever is a tick-borne illness due to Rickettsia rickettsii, a weakly gram-negative, obligate intracellular organism that has an affinity for vascular endothelial cells.  Patients usually have nonspecific symptoms (eg, fever, malaise, myalgia) followed by a macular-petechial rash that begins on the ankles and wrists and spreads to the center of the body as well as to the palms and soles.

Although it may be appropriate to perform testing for other sexually transmitted infections, gonorrhea would be an unlikely explanation for this patient's painful genital ulcer. $#(Choice E)#  Granuloma inguinale is characterized by painless, extensive ulcerative lesions, typically without lymphadenopathy. $#(Choice F)#  @Molluscum contagiosum@ is a contagious disease caused by infection with a DNA poxvirus.  Lesions are smooth, skin-colored, firm, somewhat pearly papules that measure about 2-6 mm and often have a central umbilication. $#(Choice G)#  Primary syphilis commonly presents as a characteristically painless single genital ulcer called a chancre.  The diagnosis is established by identification of the organisms on darkfield microscopy, serologic testing, or syphilis antibody testing.  Secondary syphilis is often characterized by systemic symptoms, lymphadenopathy, grey mucous patches, raised grey genital papules (condylomata lata), and a diffuse rash involving the palms and soles. $#(Choice H)# Penile squamous cell cancer can present as lumps or ulcers, sometimes with adenopathy.  However, the lesions are typically painless, and average age at presentation is 50. $#Educational objective# Chancroid, due to Haemophilus ducreyi, presents as deep, painful (you \"do cry\" with H ducreyi) ulcers with ragged borders that are associated with a grey exudate and inguinal lymphadenopathy.

Reductions in mycolic acid availability impair cell wall development, leading to a bactericidal effect.  However, INH is only active once it is processed by mycobacterial catalase-peroxidase.  Therefore, mycobacteria can limit the effect of INH by reducing intracellular levels of catalase-peroxidase.  Other common mechanisms of INH resistance are alteration in the target enzyme binding site and overexpression of the target enzyme. $#(Choice A)#  Ethambutol likely inhibits synthesis of the mycobacterial cell wall.  Resistance develops when the mycobacteria increase production of arabinosyl transferase (an enzyme in the pathway to arabinogalactan, a key constituent of the mycobacterial cell wall). $#(Choice C)#  Because pyrazinamide must be converted to an active form by the mycobacterial enzyme pyrazinamidase, drug resistance can occur when pyrazinamidase is altered or eliminated. $#(Choice D)#  Resistance to rifampin is primarily due to a mutation in the gene that codes for a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase necessary for transcription and RNA elongation. $#(Choice E)#  Streptomycin (used in some patients with tuberculosis) is an aminoglycoside that inhibits mycobacterial protein synthesis by disabling the bacterial ribosomal 30S subunit (which disrupts translation).  Resistance to this drug is primarily achieved by a modification of the 30S ribosomal protein. $#Educational objective# Mycobacterial resistance to isoniazid (INH) is primarily mediated by reductions in the catalase-peroxidase enzyme or through genetic modification of the INH binding site on the mycolic acid synthesis enzyme.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient with fever, pulmonary symptoms, and a lobar consolidation on chest x-ray has #pneumonia#.  The presence of gram-positive diplococci in the sputum indicates the underlying pathogen is #Streptococcus pneumoniae#, the leading cause of community-acquired pneumonia.  Over 90 strains of S pneumoniae have been identified; they are distinguished based on antigenic variations in the #capsular polysaccharide#, the major virulence factor of the bacteria.  Antibodies against the polysaccharide capsule are generated during infection and provide long-lasting immunity against that strain. $The pneumococcal vaccine contains polysaccharide antigens from the most common disease-causing serotypes leading to the generation of protective antibodies against these strains.  In the United States, 2 types of pneumococcal vaccinations are available:  $1. #Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine# contains capsular material from 23 serotypes.  Because polysaccharides cannot be displayed by the major histocompatibility complex of antigen-presenting cells (only peptides can), immunogenicity to this vaccine is T-cell independent and generates a mild antibody response with no memory cells.  Although polysaccharide vaccines are fairly effective for most adult patients, they are not useful for infants (age <2).  $2. #Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine# consists of capsular polysaccharides from 13 serotypes that have been covalently attached to recombinant, inactivated diphtheria toxin.  Protein conjugation allows the polysaccharide to be displayed by the major histocompatibility complex and induces a much stronger immunogenic response that involves T-cell–mediated B-lymphocyte activation.  This generates high- affinity IgG antibodies and memory B-cells and also creates mucosal IgA antibodies, which reduce colonization rates. $Pneumococcal vaccination significantly reduces the risk of invasive pneumococcal disease.  Routine vaccination is recommended for all children as part of their childhood immunization series.  Adults age >65 and those at high risk for invasive disease (eg, HIV, asplenia, other immunosuppressed states) should also be vaccinated. $#(Choice A)#  Histoplasma is a fungal infection that is primarily transmitted by inhalation of particles from soil contaminated with bird or bat droppings.  Diagnosis is usually made by urine or serum antigen testing, but yeasts can sometimes be identified on histology/culture using specialized stains. $#(Choice B)#  Close contacts of patients who have pertussis should be given antibiotic chemoprophylaxis.  Pertussis is a gram-negative encapsulated coccobacillus; infected adults usually develop a few weeks of malaise and rhinorrhea followed by several weeks of severe, paroxysmal cough. $#(Choice C)#  The influenza vaccine contains 3 or 4 strains of inactivated influenza virus.  Influenza usually causes abrupt-onset fever, headache, myalgia, and malaise and would not appear on Gram stain. $#(Choice D)#  Legionella is a common cause of atypical pneumonia and is usually transmitted by contaminated water systems.  However, Legionella is a gram-negative bacterium (not a gram-positive diplococcus) and is usually diagnosed with urine antigen testing. $#Educational objective# Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccination reduces the risk of invasive disease and is recommended for young patients and the elderly.  The pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine is an unconjugated vaccine that induces a T-cell–independent humoral immune response.  In contrast, the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine contains polysaccharide material attached to a protein antigen, which creates a robust T-cell–mediated humoral immune response.  "

  "explanation_2": "#Blastomyces dermatitidis#, a fungus endemic in the southeastern United States (states east of the Mississippi River), is present in soil and rotten organic matter.  Blastomyces is a dimorphic fungus, meaning it assumes different forms at different temperatures.  In the human body (37-40 C), it assumes the @yeast form@ (single cells).  The image shows a typical #large yeast# with a single, #broad-based bud#.  The mold form (branching hyphae) predominates in the environment, at average temperatures of 25-30 C. $Infection occurs by inhalation of aerosolized fungus from the environment.  In about half of #immunocompetent# individuals, blastomycosis may present as a lung infection or cause a flu-like illness (fever, chills, myalgia, headache, nonproductive cough) or pneumonia (fever, cough, pleuritic chest pain).  #Pulmonary# blastomycosis is diagnosed by finding the typical yeast forms.  In #immunocompromised# patients, blastomycosis can cause #disseminated# disease.  Patients experience systemic symptoms (fever, weight loss, night sweats), lung involvement (cough, dyspnea), skin lesions (papules, pustules, ulcers, verrucous lesions), and #bone# pain (caused by lytic lesions). $#(Choice A)# @ Aspergillus fumigatus@ can cause lung disease in immunocompromised patients.  It has only a mold form; in tissue samples it is seen as septate hyphae that branch at 45-degree angles. $#(Choice C)#  @Candida albicans@ is characterized by small oval yeast with narrow-based budding.  Candida pneumonia is a very rare disease. $#(Choice D)#  @Coccidioides immitis@ is also a dimorphic fungus.  It is seen as spherules (round encapsulated structures containing many endospores) in tissue samples. $#(Choice E)#  @Cryptococcus neoformans@ causes lung disease and meningitis in immunocompromised patients.  In contrast to blastomycosis, it forms round yeast with variable sizes and narrow-based buds.  Cryptococcus has a thick polysaccharide capsule that appears clear with India ink staining and stains red with mucicarmine. $#(Choice F)#  @Histoplasma capsulatum@ can cause lung disease.  Like Blastomyces, it is a dimorphic fungus.  Unlike Blastomyces, the yeast form of Histoplasma is smaller and is often found intracellularly within macrophages.  H capsulatum is endemic in parts of the central and eastern United States along the Ohio and Mississippi river valleys. $#(Choice G)#  Rhizopus species can cause lung disease in immunocompromised patients.  Rhizopus is the most common genus causing @mucormycosis@.  It has only a mold form, with broad ribbon-like hyphae with rare septations. $ #Educational objective# Blastomyces dermatitidis is a dimorphic fungus seen in tissue as round or oval yeasts with thick walls and broad-based budding.  It is endemic in the southeastern United States (states east of the Mississippi River).  The lungs are the primary site of involvement, and the skin and bone are the major sites of dissemination.  ",

  "explanation_2": "#Legionellosis# can be divided into Pontiac fever (an acute, flu-like, self-limited disease) and the more common Legionnaires' disease.  Legionnaires' disease should be suspected in patients with recent exposure to #contaminated water# (sporadic cases or common-source outbreaks in cruise ships, spas, hospitals, or air-conditioned hotels), radiographic evidence of pneumonia (typically patchy infiltrates that may progress to consolidation), #high fever# (>39 C [102.2 F]) sometimes associated with #relative bradycardia#,# neurologic# symptoms (eg, confusion, headache), and #gastrointestinal #(GI) symptoms (eg, diarrhea).  Risk groups include the elderly or immunocompromised, smokers, and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. $Because Legionella pneumophila is a faintly staining gram-negative bacillus that is facultatively intracellular, Gram stain typically shows many neutrophils but few or no organisms.  Legionella is often diagnosed by urinary antigen testing; it grows on selective medium (buffered charcoal yeast extract [BCYE]).  The most common laboratory abnormality is #hyponatremia#, frequently associated with Legionella but not other causes of pneumonia.  The hyponatremia may be related to inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion and/or renal tubulointerstitial disease impairing sodium reabsorption (possibly due to either direct effect of Legionella, cytokines, or natriuretic peptides).  Elevated transaminases are also common. $#(Choice A)#  This patient does not have asthma, making allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (pulmonary infiltrates/bronchiectasis with eosinophilia and elevated IgE and anti-Aspergillus antibody titers) unlikely.  Some helminthic infections are associated with pulmonary infiltrates and eosinophilia (Löffler).  However, high fever, neurologic symptoms, and concurrent GI and pulmonary symptoms are unusual. $#(Choices B and D)#  Streptococcus pneumoniae (gram-positive diplococci on Gram stain) is the most common overall cause of community-acquired pneumonia.  Lobar consolidation is classic.  Patients with influenza A typically experience the abrupt onset of fever, headache, myalgias, and malaise that gradually improve over 2-5 days, with a subset developing secondary bacterial pneumonia (exacerbation of fever and respiratory symptoms after initial improvement).  However, dry cough, GI and neurologic symptoms, and interstitial infiltrates in the setting of a recent cruise make Legionella more likely. $#(Choice E)#  Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection can result in cold agglutinin formation.  However, M pneumoniae predominantly affects young adults and is more likely to cause tracheobronchitis than pneumonia.  Clinical presentation is typically mild with bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray appearing more severe than expected based on clinical findings. $#Educational objective# Legionella pneumophila is a facultative intracellular gram-negative bacillus that can cause a systemic infection.  Symptoms frequently include high fever, cough, confusion, and diarrhea.  The most common laboratory abnormality seen with Legionella pneumonia is hyponatremia, and sputum Gram stain often shows many neutrophils but few or no organisms.  "

This patient may have contracted the disease during karate sessions with his students.  Chest x-ray is unremarkable in most cases as there is no pulmonary consolidation.

Paroxysmal phase - marked by #severe coughing spells# with the classic inspiratory whoop or #post-tussive emesis/syncope  $##3. #Convalescent phase - during which the cough improves $Pertussis is caused by the #gram-negative coccobacillus# Bordetella pertussis, which produces virulence factors that include adhesins and toxins.  Pertactin, which forms the basis of the acellular pertussis vaccine, promotes B pertussis adherence to the ciliated upper respiratory epithelium.  Tracheal cytotoxin subsequently promotes local tissue destruction, resulting in cough.  #Pertussis toxin# causes excessive #adenylate cyclase activity#, which prevents effective phagocytosis and allows the organism to persist in alveolar macrophages and ciliated epithelial cells, leading to a prolonged disease course.  #Lymphocytosis#, induced by pertussis toxin, is also common. $#(Choice A)#  This patient lacks the constitutional symptoms (eg, night sweats, weight loss, fever) and chest x-ray findings (eg, upper lobe infiltrates with cavitation) expected in pulmonary tuberculosis, which is caused by the acid-fast bacillus Mycobacterium tuberculosis. $#(Choice C)#  Streptococcus pneumoniae, a gram-positive diplococcus, is the most common cause of pneumonia and typically presents with lobar consolidation on chest x-ray.

Detection of the pathogen is typically made with #urine antigen testing#, but the organism can also be visualized with silver stain and grown on buffered charcoal yeast extract agar supplemented with L-cysteine and iron (ground-glass colonies).  L pneumophila has a strong affinity for the lung (hence the name pneumophila) and typically causes a #multifocal pneumonia# that is preceded by nonspecific symptoms (eg, high fever, myalgia, headache) and diarrhea. $L pneumophila is a frequent contaminant of natural bodies of water, municipal #water supplies#, and water-based# cooling systems# found in commercial and hospital settings.  #Aerosolization# and subsequent inhalation of contaminated water can lead to #outbreaks# of Legionella pneumonia.  Common nosocomial sources of infection include showers/baths, cooling towers, nasogastric tubes, ventilators, nebulizers, and other respiratory therapy equipment.  Cigarette smoking and chronic lung disease increase the risk for infection. $#(Choice A)#  Staphylococcus aureus colonizes the anterior nares and can spread from asymptomatic carriers to hospitalized patients or other individuals.  Although methicillin-resistant S aureus can cause severe, rapidly progressive pneumonia, the organism appears as gram-positive cocci in clusters. $#(Choice C)#  Listeria can be transmitted by contaminated ready-to-eat food.  It is associated with febrile diarrhea and is poorly visualized by Gram stain.  However, the diagnosis is usually made by visualizing the organism on light microscopy (tumbling motility) or identifying it on blood or cerebrospinal fluid culture.  It is not typically identified by sputum sample silver stain or urine antigen testing. $#(Choice D)#  Influenza colonizes the nasopharynx, and outbreaks are common in long-term care facilities and other cohabitated settings.  Although influenza often causes nonspecific symptoms (eg, myalgia, malaise, fever) and cough, the virus is typically diagnosed by antigen testing from a nasopharyngeal swab. $#(Choice E)#  Widespread use of long-term intravascular devices increases the risk of catheter-related bacteremia and sepsis with skin flora such as coagulase-negative staphylococci and S aureus.  Bacteremia is typically identified by Gram stain and culture of peripheral blood. $#Educational objective# Legionella pneumophila commonly contaminates natural bodies of water, municipal water supplies, and water-based cooling systems.  The organism is inhaled in aerosolized water and establishes infection via the pulmonary route.

  "explanation_2": "$This asymptomatic patient with previously eradicated tuberculosis now has a spherical mass occupying a preexisting lung cavity, findings consistent with an aspergilloma.  #Aspergillus fumigatus# is a mold that is ubiquitous in the environment and widely present in soil and organic matter.  Spores are constantly inhaled and typically cleared by the respiratory tract's innate defenses (eg, mucociliary escalator, macrophages).  However, #chronic colonization# can occur in patients with underlying abnormal lung structure, such as those with bullae (eg, emphysema) or #old cavities# (eg, prior tuberculosis, postsurgical status). $Over months to years, Aspergillus proliferates in the cavity, forming a conglomeration of hyphae and cellular debris known as an #aspergilloma#.  The @fungus ball@ (mycetoma) appears as a round intracavity mass surrounded by a crescent of air (surrounding empty space).  The aspergilloma @shifts with gravity@, helping distinguish it from other lung masses (eg, neoplasm) fixed to the parenchyma. $Aspergillomas typically grow uneventfully and do not elicit a significant host immunologic reaction.  Therefore, they usually remain asymptomatic for years and are only #detected incidentally# (as in this trauma patient).  Occasionally, aspergillomas can erode into adjacent blood vessels, producing #hemoptysis#. $#(Choice A)#  Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is a TH2–induced, IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to Aspergillus spores that become trapped in dysfunctional airways (eg, asthma, cystic fibrosis).  It presents with difficult-to-control asthma and @bronchiectasis@ (copious, thick sputum; thickened dilated airways with mucus impaction). $#(Choice C)#  Aspergillus is not contagious (ie, transmissible from person to person); it is acquired passively from inhalation of fungal spores in the environment.  Reactivation tuberculosis can cause new areas of cavitation or consolidation (not a cavity-filling mass) and is typically accompanied by profound constitutional symptoms (eg, weight loss, night sweats, fever). $#(Choice D)#  @Dystrophic calcification@ is a frequent sequela of granulomatous inflammation (eg, old/healed histoplasmosis or tuberculosis).  However, such granuloma-related calcification would have radiodensity equal to that of bone (eg, similar to adjacent vertebrae), would not affect a preexisting cavity, and typically also involves the hilar lymph nodes. $#(Choice E)#  Squamous cell lung cancer can cavitate (representing central tumor necrosis).  However, invasive malignancies violate anatomic planes, appearing irregular and spiculated, and are typically symptomatic (eg, chest pain, hemoptysis, weight loss).  A well-circumscribed, round mass forming within a preexisting, thin-walled cavity is more consistent with aspergilloma. $#Educational objective# Aspergillus fumigatus, a ubiquitous environmental mold, can chronically colonize old pulmonary cavities (eg, prior tuberculosis), forming a fungus ball (aspergilloma) that does not elicit a significant host immune response and is typically discovered incidentally.

C. immitis is endemic to the southwestern United States (i.e., southern and central California, Arizona, New Mexico, and western Texas), northern Mexico, and some regions of Central and South America.  Patients with coccidioidomycosis are likely to live in or have recently traveled to an endemic area. $C. immitis is transmitted by spore inhalation.  Spores are formed by fragmentation of hyphae.  Once inside the lungs, the spores turn into spherules that contain endospores.  The spherules subsequently rupture and release endospores that disseminate to other organs and tissues.  Each endospore is capable of forming a new spherule. $In immunocompetent hosts, C. immitis causes lung disease, which can be asymptomatic or cause flu-like symptoms (e.g., cough, fever, and myalgia) accompanied by erythema nodosum.

  "explanation_2": "The procedure described above is the acid-fast stain, which is used in the detection of a select few pathogenic organisms (eg, Mycobacterium and some Nocardia species).  Although it is less sensitive than culture, the acid-fast stained smear allows for immediate microscopic evaluation. $In the acid-fast stain for mycobacteria, the smear is first treated with an aniline dye (eg, carbolfuchsin).  The dye (red color) penetrates the bacterial cell wall, where it binds with mycolic acids.  The slide is then treated with hydrochloric acid and alcohol.  This acid alcohol dissolves the outer cell membranes of nontuberculous bacteria, but the presence of mycolic acids prevents decolorization of mycobacteria.  A counterstain (eg, methylene blue) is then applied and taken up by decolorized bacteria.  As a result, the carbolfuchsin acid-fast stain produces red mycobacteria (initial stain) and blue non-acid fast bacteria. $The cell membrane and cell wall of mycobacteria are most similar to those in Gram-positive organisms, causing mycobacteria to appear weakly positive on Gram stain.  However, the mycobacterial cell wall differs from that of the typical Gram-positive organism in that they are encapsulated with mycolic acid, a waxy, long-chain fatty acid that is covalently bound to the sugars within the cell wall.  Another organism that will also stain positive with the acid-fast technique is Nocardia.  Nocardia is a Gram-positive rod that contains mycolic acid in its cell wall.  Because Nocardia possesses less mycolic acid than do mycobacteria, Nocardia is more weakly acid fast. $#(Choice A)#  N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetylglucosamine are the saccharides that combine with an amino acid chain to form the peptidoglycan layer in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative cell walls. $#(Choice B)#  Teichoic acid is a molecule linked to the peptidoglycan cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria (but not Gram-negative bacteria).  Teichoic acid serves as an antigenic determinant for organism identification in the laboratory and an antigenic target for the human immune system. $#(Choice C)#  Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a component of the outer cell envelope of Gram-negative bacteria. $#(Choice E)#  Unique to fungi, ergosterol is the sterol component of fungal cell membranes.  This molecule is not found in human cell membranes, as human cells have cholesterol in their cell membranes instead. $#Educational objective# The acid-fast stain identifies organisms that have mycolic acid present in their cell walls, including Mycobacterium and some Nocardia species.  Acid-fast staining is carried out by applying an aniline dye (eg, carbolfuchsin) to a smear and then decolorizing with acid alcohol to reveal whether the organisms present are \"acid fast.\"  "

Rhinovirus (a cause of the common cold) is a nonenveloped single-stranded RNA virus.  Adenovirus is a nonenveloped double-stranded DNA virus.  Although these viruses can cause respiratory illness, this patient's clinical features (2 weeks of progressive symptoms, impaired pulmonary function, no upper respiratory infection symptoms) and histologic findings make post-transplant CMV pneumonitis a more likely diagnosis, particularly given the lack of CMV prophylaxis. $#(Choice C)#  Organs affected by Nocardia and Actinomyces show filamentous branching beaded gram-positive rods in Gram stain preparations.  Nocardia is aerobic and positive for modified acid-fast stain; Actinomyces is anaerobic and negative for modified acid-fast stain. $#(Choice F)#  Histopathologic and cytologic findings in Pneumocystis jirovecii@ pneumonia (PCP)@ include eosinophilic foamy alveolar material and cystic and trophic forms that can be stained with Giemsa or @silver stain@ (producing a cup-in-saucer appearance).

The cells are arranged in long, slender, @serpentine cords@ due to the presence of a hydrophobic surface glycolipid called #cord factor#. $Cord factor is composed of two mycolic acid molecules bound to the disaccharide trehalose (trehalose dimycolate).  In vivo, cord factor forms cylindrical micelles that surround the organism and #prevent macrophage-mediated destruction# within the phagolysosome.  It also forms a highly toxic crystalline monolayer on hydrophobic surfaces (oil-water/air-water interface [eg, edge of cavitation]) that helps drive the formation of #caseating granulomas# (a hallmark of M tuberculosis infection). $#(Choice A)#  Mycolic acid is the primary component of the cell wall of all Mycobacterium species and is the source of their acid-fastness (ability to retain dye in the presence of acid).  Although mycolic acid is a component of cord factor, it alone does not cause M tuberculosis to grow in a serpentine pattern.  Other less virulent mycobacteria (eg, M avium) are also acid-fast but have lower concentrations of cord factor and do not typically form serpentine chains. $#(Choice B)#  M tuberculosis antibiotic resistance is due largely to mutations in the genes responsible for the synthesis of mycolic acid (isoniazid) and mycobacterial RNA polymerase (rifampin).  Antibiotic resistance does not cause the bacteria to grow in a serpentine pattern. $#(Choice C)#  Pigment production is characteristic of some mycobacteria, especially nontuberculous organisms such as M marinum, but is not associated with cord formation. $#(Choice D)#  The slow growth rate of M tuberculosis contributes to the need for prolonged antibiotic regimens due to decreased antibiotic responsiveness.  However, it does not affect the ability of the organism to form serpentine cords. $#Educational objective# Mycobacterium tuberculosis grows in long, serpentine cords due to the presence of cord factor, a surface glycolipid, on the cell wall.  Cord factor is a primary virulence factor of M tuberculosis; it protects the bacteria from digestion by macrophages and also leads to the formation of caseating granulomas.  ",

  "explanation_2": "$#Cystic fibrosis# (CF) is associated with the accumulation of @thick, viscous secretions@ in multiple organ systems.  In the lungs, secretions clog the airways, leading to the colonization of the lower respiratory tract with pathogenic bacteria early in the course of disease.  Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae are most commonly isolated in children, but #Pseudomonas aeruginosa#, a ubiquitous gram-negative bacillus, is the leading cause of respiratory tract colonization and infection in adults with CF. $P aeruginosa has several adaptations that make it well suited to the pulmonic environment of patients with CF including the ability to directly bind mucous, which shields the organism from phagocytosis.  Persistent colonization/infection is then primarily mediated by the following: $• #Biofilm formation# – The bacteria clump together within an extracellular matrix of polysaccharides, proteins, and DNA, which prevents phagocytosis and antibiotic-mediated destruction $• Conversion to a #mucoid phenotype# that produces an #alginate polysaccharide#, which strengthens biofilm structure and aids in the inhibition of opsonization and phagocytosis $• Downregulation of virulence factors (eg, flagella, pili, lipopolysaccharide components) reduces antigenic targets, which promotes persistent colonization $Neutrophils respond to the chronic infection by releasing elastase, myeloperoxidase, and other digestive enzymes.  However, these compounds fail to eliminate P aeruginosa and ultimately cause progressive destruction of the airway wall (ie, bronchiectasis) and a steady decline in pulmonary function. $#(Choices A and D)#  Pathogenic strains of H influenzae are able to form biofilms but do not convert to mucoid phenotype.

It exists as a filamentous mold in the environment and is found primarily in soil contaminated with #bird or bat droppings#.  Therefore, infected patients often report a history of exploring caves (exposure to bats) or cleaning bird cages or coops. $H capsulatum is transmitted when fungal spores from contaminated soil are inhaled into the alveoli.  At body temperature, the spores germinate into yeasts and are subsequently phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages.

  "explanation_2": "Although #HIV# is classically associated with impairment to the cell-mediated immune response, the virus also dramatically hampers the production of opsonizing antibodies and the recruitment of phagocytes to areas of infection.  Therefore, patients with HIV are at much greater risk for #invasive bacterial infections#, particularly with encapsulated organisms such as #Streptococcus pneumoniae#. $S pneumoniae is the most common cause of #community-acquired pneumonia# in both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected individuals, and usually presents with acute-onset fever, productive cough, leukocytosis, and signs of #lobar consolidation# (eg, dullness to percussion, crackles).  S pneumoniae is also a frequent cause of sepsis and bacterial meningitis.  To reduce the risk of invasive pneumococcal disease, all patients with HIV should be immunized with the pneumococcal vaccination, which provides immunity to the most common strains. $#(Choice A)#  Although invasive Aspergillus is much more common in patients with HIV, it primarily affects those with extremely low CD4 counts (<50/mm3).  Fever, cough, shortness of breath, and nodular or cavitary pulmonary infiltrate often occurs. $#(Choice B)#  Influenza usually causes acute-onset fever, malaise, myalgias, and headache.  Manifestations of lobar consolidation would be atypical and would likely indicate an influenza complication (eg, secondary pneumonia).  Patients with HIV should receive yearly influenza vaccination. $#(Choice C)#  Legionella is a common cause of atypical pneumonia and is far more common in patients with HIV than the general population.  Although Legionella often causes lobar consolidation, most cases are marked by several days of gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, vomiting, diarrhea) prior to developing pulmonary symptoms. $#(Choice D)#  Patients with HIV are at much greater risk of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, which usually presents over several weeks (not days) with cough, low-grade fever, weight loss, and fatigue.  Active pulmonary tuberculosis is usually characterized by cavitary disease in the upper lobes of the lung; signs of lower lobe consolidation would be atypical. $#(Choice E)#  Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a leading cause of \"walking pneumonia,\" a form of atypical pneumonia.  \"Walking pneumonia\" usually presents with several weeks (not days) of nonproductive cough and malaise.  The infection usually affects multiple lobes of lung and causes a bilateral patchy infiltrate on chest x-ray. $#(Choice F)#  Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is common in patients with HIV, but occurs primarily in those with CD4 counts <200/mm3 (unlike this patient).  It usually presents with several weeks (not days) of slowly worsening dyspnea and fever.  In addition, PCP usually affects both lungs and appears as @bilateral reticulonodular@ pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray. $#Educational objective# The most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia in both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected individuals is Streptococcus pneumoniae.  Risk of invasive pneumococcal disease is significantly increased in patients with HIV regardless of CD4 count.  ",

C neoformans is present in soil and pigeon droppings; it is transmitted by the respiratory route but not acquired via person-to-person contact.  Inhaled yeast forms enter the lungs, and in immunocompetent persons, they are cleared by a macrophage response directed by T cells.  In individuals with an impaired cellular immune response, C neoformans can disseminate and cause #symptomatic# disease, most commonly #meningoencephalitis#. $Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis is typically seen in patients with HIV, sarcoidosis, or leukemia and in those on high-dose corticosteroid therapy.  Headache, nausea, vomiting, and confusion are common symptoms.  Diagnosis can be made by examining @cerebrospinal fluid@ (CSF), which shows round, budding, encapsulated yeasts.  With @India ink staining@, the thick polysaccharide capsules classically appear as peripheral clearings or halos.  Serologic testing (latex agglutination) is used to detect the C neoformans capsular antigen in CSF. $#(Choices A and D)#  Esophagitis in a patient with HIV is most commonly caused by Candida infection; it presents with odynophagia and is diagnosed by endoscopy with biopsy.  Oral thrush due to Candida, which manifests as white oral plaques, is associated with diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression (eg, HIV), and treatment with antibiotics and corticosteroids. $#(Choice B)#  Although C neoformans enters the body through the lungs, pulmonary symptoms are often not prominent.  Some patients may develop cough, dyspnea, or pleuritic chest pain, but pulmonary cryptococcosis is a less common manifestation than cryptococcal meningoencephalitis.  In contrast, Pneumocystis jirovecii is a frequent cause of pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals, but microscopy would show cup- or crescent-shaped organisms (not budding yeast with thick, mucicarmine-positive capsules). $#(Choice E)#  Mucormycosis, which classically affects the paranasal sinuses, occurs in immunocompromised patients and is strongly associated with diabetes mellitus and diabetic ketoacidosis.  Aspergillus fumigatus is another fungus that may cause sinusitis. $#(Choice F)#  Cutaneous cryptococcal disease (eg, papules, pustules) is rare.  Dimorphic fungi Blastomyces and Histoplasma may cause cutaneous lesions, but the yeast forms do not have mucicarmine-positive capsules. $#Educational objective# Meningoencephalitis is the most common symptomatic presentation of Cryptococcus neoformans infection and typically occurs in immunocompromised patients.

  "explanation_2": "#Mycoplasma pneumoniae# infection is common in adolescents and usually presents with tracheobronchitis or walking pneumonia.  The pathogen attaches to the respiratory epithelium using surface antigens (#I-antigen#) that are also present on the plasma membrane of erythrocytes.  Therefore, patients with M pneumoniae typically develop @cross-reactive IgM antibodies@ that can attach to red blood cells, activate the complement system, and cause erythrocyte lysis.  These cross-reacting antibodies are called #cold agglutinins# because they bind to erythrocytes most strongly at temperatures #below core body temperature#.  Testing for cold agglutinins can be done at the bedside by drawing blood into an edetate disodium–containing tube and placing it in a cup of ice.  Removing the tube after several seconds will reveal clumping/agglutination that resolves as the tube warms. $Cold agglutinins are often asymptomatic, but some patients develop mild intravascular #hemolytic anemia# that usually resolves after 6-8 weeks (when IgM antibody titers fall).  Patients who have infectious mononucleosis and certain hematologic malignancies also commonly develop cold agglutinins. $#Educational objective# Infection with Mycoplasma pneumoniae can result in the formation of cold agglutinins, which are IgM antibodies (primarily) that bind red blood cells and cause clumping/agglutinations at low body temperatures.  Other illnesses resulting in cold agglutinin formation include infectious mononucleosis and certain hematologic malignancies.  ",

The lac Z gene codes for β-galactosidase, which is responsible for the hydrolysis of lactose to glucose and galactose.  The lac Y gene codes for permease, which allows lactose to enter the bacterium.  The lac p region is the binding site for RNA polymerase during the initiation of transcription.  The Lac I repressor protein is the product of the lac I gene and is constitutively expressed.  Repressor proteins, when bound to the operator region, prevent binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter region, thus decreasing transcription of the lac Z, lac Y, and lac A genes.  Culture of E coli in lactose-containing media causes a conformational change in the repressor protein, preventing its attachment to the operator region and increasing transcription of the lac operon structural genes. $Culturing E coli in media containing glucose results in reduced expression of the lac operon, even when the media contains lactose as well.  This occurs because the lac operon is positively regulated by the binding of catabolite activator protein (CAP) to a site slightly upstream from the promoter region.  This only occurs when cAMP concentrations are high.  Since glucose decreases the activity of adenylyl cyclase (reducing intracellular cAMP), the lac operon is repressed in high-glucose conditions.  In summary, the lac operon is regulated by 2 distinct mechanisms:  $1. Negatively by binding of the repressor protein to the operator locus  $2. Positively by cAMP-CAP binding upstream from the promoter region $Mutations impairing the binding of the repressor protein to its binding site at the operator region will prevent repression of the genes of the lac operon in the absence of lactose.  This results in increased transcription of the genes of the lac operon in lactose-deficient media, although the presence of glucose will prevent maximal transcriptional activity. $#(Choices A and D)#  Mutations that impair the binding of cAMP-CAP to its regulatory site upstream from the promoter will decrease transcription of the lac operon, as cAMP-CAP is a positive regulator. $#(Choices C and E)#  Mutations impairing the binding of RNA polymerase to the promotor region will also reduce transcription of the lac operon. $#Educational objective# The lac operon is regulated by two distinct mechanisms: negatively by binding of the repressor protein to the operator locus and positively by cAMP-CAP binding upstream from the promoter region.  Constitutive expression of the structural genes of the lac operon occurs with mutations that impair the binding of the repressor protein (Lac I) to its regulatory sequence in the operator region.

  "explanation_2": "This patient's rheumatoid arthritis is being treated with adalimumab, a #tumor necrosis factor# (TNF)-#alpha inhibitor#.  TNF-alpha is a crucial cytokine of the cell-mediated immune response that aids in macrophage activation, phagolysosome function, and the formation and maintenance of @granulomas@.  Blockade of TNF-alpha #increases the risk of infection# with pathogens controlled by the cell-mediated immune response such as intracellular bacteria (eg, Mycobacterium tuberculosis), viruses, and granulomatous fungi. $This patient's pulmonary and reticuloendothelial (eg, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly) findings and positive urine fungal antigen test raise strong suspicion for infection with #Histoplasma capsulatum#, a dimorphic fungus endemic to the #Ohio# and Mississippi River Valleys.  H capsulatum is a mold that is inhaled from contaminated soil and converts to a yeast form in the lungs.  Phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages does not result in destruction of the organism due to microbial virulence factors that prevent phagolysosome acidification.  Therefore, for the first several weeks of infection, @H capsulatum@ is able to #proliferate within macrophages# in an unchecked fashion. $Eventually, the cell-mediated immune response controls the infection in most healthy patients.  However, those with impaired immunity (as in this case) are at high risk for life-threatening #disseminated disease#.  The lungs, reticuloendothelial system, and mouth (oral ulcers) are most commonly affected.  Urine Histoplasma antigen testing is often used to quickly confirm the diagnosis. $#(Choice B)#  Aspergillus fumigatus is a monomorphic mold that can cause invasive disease in those who are immunocompromised.  This organism is inhaled into the lungs and can invade the vascular endothelial lining, leading to dissemination through the bloodstream.  However, patients usually have fever, chest pain, and hemoptysis. $#(Choice C)#  Candida species are part of the endogenous human flora, but overgrowth can occur in those with immunocompromisation and lead to mucocutaneous (eg, thrush) or invasive (pneumonia, fungemia) disease.  Invasive Candida infections are generally diagnosed by blood culture or biopsy with histopathology, not urine antigen testing. $#(Choice D)#  Cryptococcus neoformans is a yeast with a thick, antiphagocytic, polysaccharide capsule that primarily causes infections in those who are immunocompromised (particularly patients with advanced AIDS).  Although pulmonary infection can occur, disseminated disease is usually marked by meningoencephalitis (eg, headache, confusion, altered mental state). $#(Choice E)#  Malassezia is a dimorphic fungus that is part of normal skin flora.  Conversion from yeast form to the pathogenic mycelial form results in tinea versicolor, which is associated with the characteristic spaghetti and meatballs appearance on microscopy (ie, both hyphae and yeasts seen). $#Educational objective#Tumor necrosis factor–alpha inhibitors are associated with impairments to the cell-mediated immune response and increase the risk of infection with intracellular bacteria and granulomatous fungi (eg, Histoplasma capsulatum).  Histoplasma replicates within the intracellular space of macrophages and can spread from the lungs to the lymph nodes and the reticuloendothelial system (liver, spleen, bone marrow).  ",

Four major Plasmodium species cause malaria (Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale, Plasmodium malariae), but most cases worldwide are due to P falciparum or P vivax.  In #Brazil#, the dominant strain is #P vivax# (~90%). $Although the overall life cycle of malaria is relatively preserved across species, P vivax and P ovale have a unique feature not seen in the other strains: They undergo a #dormant hepatic phase# (hypnozoite stage) that may cause #recurrent parasitemia# weeks or months after initial symptoms.  Manifestations of recurrence resemble those of initial disease; most patients develop high fever, #flu-like symptoms# (eg, myalgia, fatigue, headache, chills), and splenomegaly.  Laboratory evaluation typically shows #anemia#, mild thrombocytopenia, and indirect bilirubinemia.  The diagnosis is confirmed when @trophozoites@ (intraerythrocytic, ringed inclusions) are seen on peripheral blood smear using Giemsa stain. $Although P falciparum can be treated with an agent that targets only the intraerythrocytic phase of infection, P vivax and P ovale must be treated with a #combination of drugs# that targets the intraerythrocytic phase (eg, chloroquine) and the dormant hepatic phase (eg, primaquine) to ensure clearance.

Dengue causes hemorrhagic febrile syndrome, and chikungunya usually causes fever with severe joint pain.  Neither has ring-shaped intraerythrocytic forms. $#(Choice D)#  Histoplasmosis is a dimorphic fungus found in soil contaminated by avian droppings.

Intraerythrocytic ring-shaped forms are not seen. $#(Choice E)#  Toxin-induced oncogenic transformation could lead to hematologic malignancy or myelodysplasia, which could cause alterations to erythrocytes (eg, teardrop cells), anemia, and splenomegaly.  However, ring-shaped erythrocyte inclusions are not seen. $#Educational objective# Unlike Plasmodium falciparum, the eradication of Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale requires primaquine to target the dormant hepatic phase.

In contrast, P falciparum does not have a dormant hepatic phase; it matures in (and is released from) the liver over 8-30 days. $#(Choice E)#  Mefloquine has strong activity against intraerythrocytic Plasmodium trophozoites.  Furthermore, intraerythrocytic trophozoites typically lyse red blood cells every 24-48 hours, leading to cyclic symptoms (eg, fever, chills, malaise); it is unlikely that an intraerythrocytic infection would cause symptoms several weeks later. $#Educational objective# Mefloquine chemoprophylaxis for malaria must be continued for 4 weeks after return from a malaria-endemic region to ensure the elimination of hepatic schizonts (which mature in the liver over 8-30 days).

Manifestations include thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and renal insufficiency. $#(Choice A)#  Clostridioides difficile produces 2 exotoxins, one of which is a cytotoxin (toxin B) that disrupts the cytoskeleton by depolymerizing actin and causing cell death. $#(Choice C)#  Exotoxins produced by Corynebacterium diphtheriae (diphtheria toxin) inactivate elongation factor 2 via ribosylation, which leads to the inhibition of protein synthesis and cell death. $#(Choices D and E)#  Unlike STEC, enterotoxigenic E coli produces heat-labile toxin (LT) and heat-stable toxin (ST).  LT increases intracellular cyclic AMP in intestinal mucosal cells, which leads to the decreased absorption and increased secretion of sodium, chloride, and water; ST increases intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP), also contributing to diarrhea and electrolyte loss.  Watery, not bloody, diarrhea occurs. $#Educational objective# Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli O157:H7 elaborates Shiga toxin, which inactivates 60S ribosomal subunits in colonic mucosal cells, leading to the inhibition of protein synthesis and apoptosis; clinical manifestations include bloody diarrhea.  Hematogenous spread of Shiga toxin to renal endothelial cells can also lead to hemolytic uremic syndrome.  "

  "explanation_2": "Facial pain, headache, and nasal eschar in a patient with likely diabetic ketoacidosis (pH 7.1, positive ketones, and dry mucous membranes in a young patient with recent unintended weight loss) are highly suggestive of #mucormycosis#, caused by Mucor or Rhizopus, among others.  Most cases are #rhinocerebral#; the infection (acquired by spore inhalation) ascends from the nasal passage to the sinuses/orbits and then sometimes to the brain, leading to confusion, neurological deficits, and death.  The increased incidence of mucormycosis in patients with #diabetes mellitus# is due to the ketone reductase activity of Rhizopus, allowing it to thrive in ketoacidotic environments. $Histologic examination (eg, #mucosal biopsy#) is necessary for diagnosis.  The @fungi@ appear as ribbon-like #broad nonseptate hyphae# with #right-angle branching#.  Tissue invasion is seen along blood vessels; vascular thrombosis and tissue necrosis can occur.  A black #necrotic eschar# in the nasal cavity is characteristic.

On light microscopy, Aspergillus is seen as @septated narrow hyphae with sharp-angle branching@. $#(Choice A)#  Blood cultures are usually negative in mucormycosis despite the organism's angioinvasive nature.  In contrast, blood cultures can be useful in diagnosing candidemia, which has a variable clinical presentation ranging from low-grade fever to severe sepsis with multiorgan failure. $#(Choice B)#  Lumbar puncture helps to diagnose cryptococcal meningitis, a fungal infection that typically has an indolent presentation and usually affects patients with AIDS.  India ink staining of cerebrospinal fluid reveals the classic encapsulated yeast of Cryptococcus neoformans. $#(Choice D)#  Ophthalmoscopy is useful for the diagnosis of Candida endophthalmitis, which typically presents with impaired visual acuity. $#(Choices E and F)#  Serologic testing is important in the diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), where increased titers of IgE and antibodies to Aspergillus fumigatus are seen.  Skin hypersensitivity testing is also useful.  However, the typical presentation of ABPA is recurrent episodes of fever and bronchial obstruction in a patient with asthma. $#Educational objective# Facial pain, headache, and a black necrotic eschar in the nasal cavity of a patient with diabetic ketoacidosis are highly suggestive of mucormycosis.  Histologic examination of the affected tissue is necessary to confirm the diagnosis.  The fungi show broad nonseptate hyphae with right-angle branching.

Transmission occurs via contaminated, large-particle droplets.  Therefore, patients who are hospitalized with influenza generally require droplet precautions (mask and gown for health care providers), and close contacts should be advised to practice appropriate hand hygiene. $#Alcohol-based disinfectants#, which are composed of ethyl or isopropyl alcohol (at concentrations of 60%-90%) in water, are often used for hand hygiene.

Nonenveloped viruses such as adenovirus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, and poliovirus are less susceptible to some alcohol-based disinfectants (particularly isopropyl-based solutions) because they do not have a lipid bilayer envelope. $#(Choice B)#  Proteins (and spores) are sterilized by moist heat (eg, autoclave), which results in protein denaturation.  Although proteins are somewhat susceptible to alcohol-based disinfectants, high concentrations must be used and efficacy is variable.  Alcohol has the strongest effect on lipophilic membranes. $#(Choice C)#  RNA can be rendered inert by ionizing radiation, which dislodges electrons and results in the formation of reactive ions that break covalent bonds.  Alcohol has a minimal effect on RNA molecule integrity. $#(Choice D)#  Neuraminidase, 1 of the 2 influenza surface glycoproteins, can be blocked by neuraminidase inhibitors (eg, oseltamivir, zanamivir).  These are often used to treat acute influenza (prevent the virus from leaving infected cells). $#(Choice E)#  The M2 ion channel mediates fusion of the influenza envelope with the endosome membrane, which liberates the influenza nucleocapsid and enzymes into the cytoplasm of the host cells.  Blockade of the M2 ion channel with amantadine can prevent influenza infection.  However, because influenza virus has developed widespread resistance to M2 ion channel inhibitors, these drugs are not recommended for use in the United States. $#Educational objective# Alcohol-based disinfectants kill enveloped viruses (eg, influenza) by dissolving their outer lipid envelope.

Due to its ability to ferment lactose, E coli binds to dye in the EMB agar and produces colonies that have a distinct green metallic sheen; most strains of E coli also demonstrate beta-hemolysis on blood agar. $Varying strains of E coli have specific virulence factors that determine disease characteristics; in the case of urinary tract infections, #P fimbriae# (pyelonephritis-associated pili) are the primary #virulence factors# due to their ability to #adhere to uroepithelium#. $Normally, E coli is a commensal bacterium in the intestinal tract; however, it can spread from the perianal region to the periurethral regions (eg, via sexual intercourse or bladder catheterization).  P fimbriae allow uropathogenic E coli to ascend into the bladder, ureters, and kidneys, leading to cystitis and pyelonephritis. $#(Choice A)#  The K1 capsular antigen promotes bloodstream survival of E coli because its sialic acid composition is similar to human cells (ie, molecular mimicry), which helps prevent phagocytosis and facilitates invasive infections.  It is the major virulence factor for E coli strains causing neonatal meningitis (not UTIs). $#(Choice B)#  Enterotoxigenic E coli produces heat-stable (ST) and heat-labile (LT) enterotoxins in the gastrointestinal tract.

Patients traveling to resource-limited regions with poor sanitation are at greatest risk. $Following ingestion, ETEC colonizes and adheres to small intestine enterocytes (mediated by pili).  The typical manifestations of abdominal cramping, nausea/vomiting, and (occasionally) low-grade fever occur due to the elaboration of plasmid-encoded heat-labile (LT) and/or heat-stable (ST) enterotoxins: $• The #LT enterotoxin#, which #resembles cholera toxin# in structure and mode of action, increases cyclic AMP in gut mucosal cells by activating adenylate cyclase. $• The ST enterotoxin (which is not inactivated by heat likely due to its small molecular size) causes an increase in cyclic GMP by activating guanylate cyclase. $Both mechanisms result in increased chloride secretion and decreased sodium reabsorption by enterocytes, resulting in #watery diarrhea#. $#(Choice A)#  Endotoxin is a lipopolysaccharide found in the cell membrane of gram-negative bacteria.  When released into the bloodstream, endotoxin causes a severe inflammatory response (eg, fever, hypotension) mediated by TNF-alpha and IL-1 secreted from activated macrophages.  However, endotoxin is present at high concentrations in the normal gut microbiota and does not cause gastrointestinal illness. $#(Choice C)#  Enteroaggregative E coli is a less common cause of self-limited watery diarrhea in resource-limited regions; adhesion of the organisms to intestinal mucosa in a \"stacked-brick\" pattern is characteristic.  Biofilm formation can occur but is thought to primarily play a role in cases of persistent (not acute) disease. $#(Choice D)#  Intestinal invasion is characteristic of gastroenteritis caused by Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter jejuni, as well as the protozoan Entamoeba histolytica.  Due to mucosal cell necrosis, invasion frequently leads to bloody diarrhea (not seen here). $#(Choice E)#  Shiga toxin-producing E coli (STEC) and Shigella dysenteriae produce Shiga toxin that inactivates the 60S ribosomal subunit in human cells, thereby inhibiting cell protein production.  Bloody diarrhea due to mucosal cell death is typical. $#Educational objective# Traveler's diarrhea is most frequently due to enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, which produces plasmid-encoded, heat-labile (LT) and heat-stable (ST) enterotoxins.  LT resembles cholera toxin and activates adenylate cyclase, leading to increased intracellular cyclic AMP; ST activates guanylate cyclase, leading to increased intracellular cyclic GMP.

Influenza strains that are unable to infect humans (eg, avian/swine influenza) encode for hemagglutinin that cannot bind to human cells. $However, influenza is prone to #antigenic changes# in its surface glycoproteins due to: $• Poor proofreading of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which results in the introduction of genetic mutations during replication (antigenic drift). $• Reassortment of the segmented genome when 2 influenza viruses infect the same cell, which results in dramatic alterations to the genome (antigenic shift). $Antigenic changes to hemagglutinin can alter the #tissue tropism# of the virus and allow strains that previously only affected livestock (eg, avian, swine) to infect human cells. $#(Choice B)#  The influenza lipid bilayer envelope is generated from host cells during viral replication.  Because it is composed of host cell lipids, it is unlikely to be significantly altered by viral mutations. $#(Choices C, D, and E)#  Following @influenza attachment@ and endocytosis, the viral bilayer envelope fuses with the endosome membrane, which liberates the nucleocapsid protein (bound to the RNA genome), viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and viral mRNA endonuclease into the cytoplasm.  These travel to the nucleus to initiate viral replication.  Although mutations to these proteins could affect viral replication, they would be unlikely to alter tissue tropism because they are not on the surface of the virus and, therefore, do not mediate viral attachment. $#Educational objective# The tissue tropism of viruses is primarily mediated by viral surface glycoproteins that bind to specific host cell receptors.  Mutations to viral surface glycoproteins can alter tissue tropism and cause noninfective viruses to become infectious.  ",

In this scenario, avian and human influenza virus particles infect host pig cells; certain progeny avian virus particles obtain some of the surface components (eg, sialic acid receptors) of the human influenza virus, allowing the avian virus to infect human cells.  This exchange is an example of #phenotypic mixing#, which generally occurs when a host cell is coinfected with 2 viral strains and progeny virions contain #unchanged parental genome# from one strain and #nucleocapsid (or envelope) proteins# from the #other# strain.  However, because there is no change in the underlying viral genomes (no genetic exchange), subsequent progeny will #revert# to having only avian influenza type surface proteins and will again be noninfectious to human epithelium. $#(Choice A)#  Interference occurs when one virus inhibits replication and/or release of a second virus that is infecting the same cell.  Simple interference would not result in a new phenotype for progeny. $#(Choice C)#  Reassortment refers to changes in genomic composition that occur when host cells are coinfected with 2 segmented viruses that exchange whole genome segments.  When reassortment takes place in a cell coinfected by 2 viral strains, any genomic change in first generation progeny will also be present in subsequent progeny. $#(Choice D)#  Recombination may be defined as the exchange of genes between 2 chromosomes (double-stranded DNA molecules) by crossing over within homologous regions.  As is the case with reassortment, any genomic change in the first generation progeny will also be present in subsequent progeny. $#(Choice E)#  Transformation is generally defined as naked DNA uptake by a prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell.  In virology, this term may also describe incorporation of viral DNA into a host cell chromosome.  Transformation alters the genetic composition of the host cell but typically causes no genomic change in progeny virions. $#Educational objective# Phenotypic mixing refers to coinfection of a host cell by 2 viral strains, resulting in progeny virions that contain nucleocapsid proteins from one strain and the unchanged parental genome of the other strain.  Because there is no change in the underlying viral genomes (no genetic exchange), the next generation of virions revert to their original, unmixed phenotypes.  "

  "explanation_2": "$#Influenza viruses (orthomyxoviruses)# are respiratory pathogens that can affect several species, including #humans, birds, and swine#.  They possess the surface proteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), which are virulence factors required for infectivity.  These proteins are also targets of the immune system, and neutralizing antibodies against them can confer immunity to specific influenza strains.  As such, HA and NA are under constant selective pressure both to maintain species-specific virulence and evade immune recognition. $Orthomyxoviruses contain a #segmented# genome, and HA and NA are coded by separate RNA segments.  This allows for #genetic reassortment# when 2 distinct strains infect the same cell.  For instance, avian coinfection with a human influenza A virus (which can also infect birds, the reservoir species for all influenza A subtypes) and an animal influenza A virus can lead to the human-type HA and the animal-type NA being packaged together into the same virion.  This has the potential to create a #novel strain# of virus to which #humans are susceptible# but have #no immunologic resistance#.  This phenomenon is known as antigenic shift, and is responsible for the majority of pandemics and epidemics of influenza A. $#(Choice A)#  Antigenic drift refers to point mutations in HA and NA genes that slightly alter the product proteins, allowing them to evade immune recognition and possibly increasing infectivity of the virus.  However, a change in species-to-species transmission likely represents a major modification in protein structure that is better explained by RNA segment reassortment. $#(Choice B)#  In genetics, complementation occurs when 2 different strains of a mutant organism are able to produce wild-type offspring.  Typically, both parents have homozygous mutations in different genes within the same metabolic pathway.  When they are crossed, the offspring inherits 1 normal allele from each parent, allowing them to bypass both of the metabolic blockades and display the wild-type phenotype. $#(Choice C)#  Frameshift mutations result when a number of bases that are #not# a multiple of 3 are added to or deleted from the coding region of a gene.  This typically results in premature termination of translation and a truncated protein containing the wrong amino acids. $#(Choice E)#  @Phenotypic mixing@ occurs when 2 viruses infect the same cell and progeny viruses exhibit coat or envelope proteins not coded for by the genetic material packaged within them.  However, subsequent progeny express only the proteins encoded by their genome.  The above scenario is not an example of phenotypic mixing as human-to-human transmission was sustained. $#Educational objective# Influenza epidemics and pandemics are typically caused by reassortment of the RNA segments coding for hemagglutinin or neuraminidase proteins (major antigenic shifts).  This process can occur between human and animal strains of influenza A virus in avian or swine hosts.  ",

Patients with rabies usually have preceding history of animal bite; furthermore, rabies is a virus, not an amoeba, and it generally presents with several days of constitutional symptoms followed by fever, hydrophobia, and pharyngeal spasm. $#(Choice B)#  Most bacterial and fungal causes of meningitis enter the brain via the hematologic dissemination (eg, basilar artery).  Although meningeal signs, vomiting, and headache frequently occur, amoebas would not be seen in the cerebrospinal fluid. $#(Choices C and D)#  The oculomotor and optic nerve do not generally transmit infections into the brain; the herpes virus can travel via the trigeminal nerve (not labeled) into the brain, leading to temporal lobe encephalitis. $#Educational objective# Primary amebic encephalitis occurs when the free-living, motile protozoan Naegleria fowleri penetrates the olfactory mucosa and migrates in a retrograde fashion through the olfactory nerve to the brain.

Shingles is caused by #reactivation# of #varicella-zoster virus# (VZV), a double-stranded DNA virus of the herpesvirus family.  Primary VZV infection occurs most commonly in childhood.  Inoculation in the nasopharyngeal mucosa is followed by migration of the virus to the regional lymphatics.

Then, the virus migrates via sensory nerves to #cranial nerve and dorsal spinal ganglia#, where it lies dormant for decades. $Most patients who have had primary chickenpox do not develop recurrent diffuse disease.  Over time, however, waning cell-mediated immune function allows reactivation of the virus, which typically spreads down a single spinal nerve to cause a painful, erythematous, vesicular rash in a dermatomal distribution.  The primary risk factor for reactivation is increasing age; other factors can include malignancy, autoimmune disease, and immune-suppressing therapy. $The varicella vaccine is recommended for prevention of primary disease in children, women of childbearing age, adults with sustained risk of exposure, and household contacts of immunocompromised hosts.  Zoster vaccine is recommended for adults age ≥50 and reduces the risk of reactivation. $#(Choice A)#  Colonization of the skin by transient flora (eg, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida species, gram-negative bacilli) occasionally leads to clinical disease, especially following antibiotic exposure (eg, vaginal candidiasis).

  "explanation_2": "$This patient with painful muscle spasms and neck/jaw contraction likely has #tetanus#, which is caused by the spore-forming anaerobic bacterium Clostridium tetani.  C tetani spores are found in soil worldwide and are typically transmitted to humans during a #puncture injury# (eg, dirty needle use, splinter).  The low oxygen tension of a puncture wound allows spores to germinate into vegetative rod-shaped bacteria that proliferate locally and produce tetanospasmin (#tetanus toxin#). $Although the pathogen is noninvasive (it stays localized to the wound site), the toxin enters the presynaptic terminals of the lower motor neurons and travels by #retrograde axonal transport# to the CNS.  In the spinal cord, at the level of the anterior horn cells, the toxin #blocks# the release of neurotransmitters from #inhibitory interneurons#, leading to spasmodic muscle contraction. $Classic findings include jaw stiffness due to masseter muscle spasm (trismus/lockjaw) and sustained contraction of the facial muscles, producing a bizarre \"smiling\" appearance (risus sardonicus).  Spasmodic contraction of the back and neck can cause opisthotonos.  Intermittent muscle spasms are frequently triggered by sensory stimuli (eg, loud noises, light, touch).  Respiratory muscle involvement can lead to respiratory failure. $#(Choice A)#  Rabies virus is transmitted via the saliva of an infected animal during a bite wound.  The virus spreads by retrograde axonal transport through peripheral nerves and enters the spinal cord/CNS.  Patients with rabies usually develop painful pharyngeal spasms, hydrophobia, fever, and hyperactivity.  However, this patient has no history of an animal bite; he likely developed tetanus due to a puncture wound with a contaminated needle. $#(Choice B)#  Food-borne botulism is marked by the ingestion of preformed botulism toxin with subsequent spread through the systemic circulation.  The toxin blocks cholinergic presynaptic nerve terminals, which results in symmetric, descending weakness. $#(Choice C)#  Bacteria (eg, Staphylococcus aureus) from a wound can spread through the bloodstream to the brain leading to brain abscess.  Symptoms vary but the most common manifestation is unilateral headache. $#(Choice D)#  Diphtheria is associated with the formation of a pseudomembranous pharyngeal exudate and the elaboration of diphtheria toxin into the systemic circulation.  The toxin causes cardiac (myocarditis) and neurologic toxicity. $#(Choice E)#  Herpes simplex virus type 1 causes orolabial lesions and is the most frequent cause of sporadic encephalitis, which occurs when the virus spreads via the trigeminal nerve or olfactory tract to the temporal lobe.  Patients usually present with confusion, fever, focal neurologic deficits, and seizures. $#Educational objective# Tetanus is caused by infection with toxigenic strains of the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium tetani.  Transmission typically occurs when spores are inoculated into the skin via a puncture wound.  The bacteria germinate, replicate locally, and elaborate tetanospasmin (tetanus toxoid).  The toxin spreads in a retrograde fashion through the lower motor neurons to the spinal cord, where it blocks inhibitory interneurons and causes spasmodic muscle contraction (eg, trismus, risus sardonicus).

  "explanation_2": "#Cryptococcus neoformans# is a low-virulence yeast with a thick polysaccharide capsule.  The organism resides in soil contaminated by bird (eg, pigeon) droppings, and human exposure primarily occurs due to #inhalation# into the #lungs#.  Alveolar macrophages ingest the yeast, travel to draining lymph nodes, and activate CD4 T-lymphocytes that subsequently promote granuloma formation and enhanced destruction of the pathogen within phagolysosomes.  Although a minority of patients clear the organism, most individuals develop #life-long latent infection#, similar to tuberculosis; those who are severely immunocompromised (eg, #AIDS# with CD4 count <100/mm3) are at high risk for reactivation. $#Cryptococcal meningitis# primarily occurs when C neoformans reactivates from a latent pulmonary focus, spreads through the circulation, and penetrates the endothelial cells of the cerebral capillaries.  Replication within the CNS leads to slowly worsening headache, fever, and confusion.  Visualization of the organism (ie, round/oval yeast with a thick capsule) on cerebrospinal fluid samples using @India ink stain@ confirms the diagnosis.  Polysaccharide antigen (cryptococcal antigen) testing can also be helpful. $#(Choice A)#  Ingestion of C neoformans in contaminated food can lead to infection.  However, this route is much less common than inhalation into the lungs. $#(Choice C)#  Acute bacterial meningitis is caused primarily by pathogens (eg, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae) that colonize the nasopharynx.  Manifestations of acute bacterial meningitis usually include the rapid onset fever, neck stiffness, and altered mental state.  Cerebrospinal fluid Gram stain will be positive. $#(Choice D)#  Patients who have untreated AIDS often develop multiple opportunistic infections; the white patches on this patient's oral mucosa likely indicate oropharyngeal candidiasis.  Superficial Candida infections rarely cause invasive disease.  In addition, Candida does not have a thick polysaccharide capsule and is not seen on India ink stain. $#(Choice E)#  Skin bacteria (eg, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes) can cause systemic infection following skin breakdown.  Systemic infection from skin fungus (eg, Candida) following skin breakdown is uncommon.  This patient's encapsulated yeast on India ink stain indicates Cryptococcus, making inhalation the most likely route of infection. $#Educational objective# Cryptococcus neoformans is a yeast with a thick polysaccharide capsule that is found primarily in soil contaminated by bird droppings.  Inhalation of the pathogen into the lungs leads to asymptomatic primary infection usually followed by life-long latent infection.

  "explanation_2": "#Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) encephalitis# is the most common cause of fatal sporadic encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain parenchyma.  HSV-1 encephalitis results from #primary oropharyngeal infection# that travels via the olfactory tract or from the #reactivation of latent virus# in the trigeminal ganglion with subsequent spread into the cerebral vault.  CT, @MRI@ (red arrow), and post-mortem macroscopic brain examination reveal #edema and hemorrhagic necrosis of the temporal lobe#.  Unilateral involvement is most common, but bilateral necrosis can also occur.  Definitive diagnosis is made by polymerase chain reaction testing of cerebrospinal fluid. $Symptoms of acute encephalitis include acute onset of #headache, fever, mental status changes# (eg, lethargy, disorientation), cranial nerve deficits (eg, Bell's palsy), and #seizures#.  Temporal lobe damage can result in receptive #aphasia# and #personality changes# (eg, hypersexuality, aggression). $#(Choice A)#  Enterovirus, particularly group B coxsackievirus, is the most common cause of viral meningitis in children.  Less commonly, enterovirus causes encephalitis and acute flaccid paralysis, but temporal lobe involvement is not typical. $#(Choice C)#  Naegleria fowleri is a free-living, protozoan parasite that causes rapid meningoencephalitis with a high mortality rate.  N fowleri is found in fresh water, and transmission occurs through nasal inhalation during recreational activities (eg, swimming, diving).  After spread through the cribriform plate to the olfactory cortex, infection leads to symptoms of encephalitis, as described above, in addition to smell and taste abnormalities.  Inflammation can be seen in the frontal and temporal lobes, brainstem, and meninges. $#(Choices D and E)#  Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae are the 2 most common causes of bacterial meningitis.  Unlike encephalitis, @meningitis@ does not affect the brain parenchyma; rather, infection of the connective tissue layers of the brain leads to classic symptoms of fever, nuchal rigidity, and altered mental status. $#(Choice F)#  Immunocompromised hosts (eg, patients with HIV) are predisposed to opportunistic pathogens (eg, Toxoplasma gondii, cytomegalovirus [CMV]) that can cause encephalitis.  Toxoplasma encephalitis is classically associated with @ring-enhancing lesions@ (white arrows) in the parietal or frontal lobes after ingestion of oocysts from soil or cat litter.  CMV encephalitis can lead to parenchymal micro-nodules and ventricular enlargement. $#Educational objective# Herpes simplex virus type 1 encephalitis is a potentially fatal complication from primary infection or reactivation of latent disease.  Nervous system invasion leads to necrosis of the temporal lobe, which can result in aphasia and personality changes in addition to classic features of encephalitis (eg, headache, fever, altered mental status, seizure).

  "explanation_2": "$This patient with gastrointestinal discomfort has manifestations of both #nicotinic# blockade (eg, dysphagia, ptosis) and #muscarinic blockade# (eg, dry mouth) that developed after he ate home-canned food.  This is strongly suggestive of food poisoning with Clostridium botulinum toxin, a preformed neurotoxin.  Botulism characteristically presents as a symmetric descending paralysis that first manifests with cranial nerve abnormalities (#diplopia, dysphagia, dysphonia [3Ds]#).  Nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain may also occur in foodborne botulism, which classically occurs 12-36 hours after consumption of contaminated foods that are fermented, preserved, or #canned improperly# at home. $#Botulinum toxin# causes disease by inhibiting nicotinic and muscarinic motor neurons.  It enters the nerve terminals through endocytosis, where it prevents binding and fusion of acetylcholine-containing synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane through the destruction of SNARE proteins.  This effectively @blocks ACh release@ into the synapse.  Botulinum toxin is highly potent; a very small quantity can be lethal without ventilatory support.  The toxin is #heat labile#, so disease can be prevented by thoroughly heating food prior to consumption. $#(Choices A, B, and C)#  The synthesis of acetylcholine in the neuron requires uptake of choline into the cell; then choline acetyltransferase synthesizes ACh from acetate and choline.  ACh is subsequently transported into secretory vesicles in preparation for secretion.  These steps are not impacted by botulinum toxin. $#(Choice E)#  Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as organophosphates, which are commonly used as insecticides, prevent ACh breakdown.  Manifestations of @organophosphate poisoning@ reflect depolarizing blockade (eg, muscle weakness, fasciculations, paralysis), CNS effects (eg, lethargy, seizures), and muscarinic overstimulation (eg, miosis, bradycardia, increased lacrimation and salivation). $#(Choice F)#  @Anticholinergic poisoning@ due to competitive antagonists of muscarinic ACh receptors (eg, atropine, scopolamine) is relatively common and can manifest as cutaneous vasodilation, anhidrosis, hyperthermia, mydriasis, and delirium.  However, these agents have no effect on the nicotinic ACh receptors controlling voluntary muscles.  Poisoning due to nicotinic receptor antagonists (eg, pancuronium, tubocurarine) is uncommon because these agents have poor oral absorption. $#Educational objective# Botulinum toxin blocks the presynaptic exocytosis of ACh vesicles, causing impaired muscarinic and nicotinic neurotransmission.  It characteristically presents as a symmetric descending paralysis that manifests with cranial nerve abnormalities, often following consumption of home-canned foods.  ",

  "explanation_2": "This patient's progressive agitation, disorientation, and pharyngospasm raises strong suspicion for #rabies#, a fatal infection caused by a neurotrophic virus from the #Rhabdoviridae# family.  Exposure usually occurs when patients come into contact with #contaminated saliva# from an infected animal (eg, dog, bat), which likely occurred during this patient's camping trip in New Mexico.  The virus contains a bullet-shaped envelope with knob-like glycoproteins that allow it to attach to the #nicotinic acetylcholine receptor# at the neuromuscular junction.  The virus replicates locally within the muscle tissue of the bite wound for several days or weeks and then travels in a retrograde fashion through peripheral nerve axons to the dorsal root ganglia.  From there, it rapidly ascends the spinal cord and infects the diencephalon, hippocampus, and brain stem. $Patients initially develop a nonspecific flu-like prodrome (fever, malaise, myalgias); paresthesias radiating proximally from a known wound site can be an important clue.  When the virus enters the CNS, the infection typically evolves into rabies encephalitis, which is characterized by painful #pharyngeal spasms# leading to avoidance of water (#hydrophobia#), mental status changes, muscular rigidity, and autonomic dysfunction (pupil dilation, #hypersalivation#).  Once symptoms of rabies encephalitis appear, postexposure prophylaxis is no longer effective and nearly all patients die. $#(Choice A)#  Epstein-Barr virus binds to CD21 on inactive B-lymphocytes and results in infectious mononucleosis, which is usually characterized by sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, malaise, and atypical lymphocytosis.  Because this virus is a member of the Herpesviridae family, initial infection is followed by a long-standing (usually asymptomatic) latent infection. $#(Choice C)#  Rhinovirus binds intracellular adhesion molecule-1, which is found on nasopharyngeal and adenoid epithelial cells.  It is associated with the common cold, not agitation, pharyngeal spasm, and hallucinations. $#(Choice D)#  The influenza virus has hemagglutinin glycoproteins that allow it to attach to sialic acids on the surface of the respiratory epithelium.  Influenza is usually characterized by fever, myalgias, cough, headache, and respiratory symptoms; agitation and pharyngeal spasm are not typical features. $#(Choice E)#  Cytomegalovirus binds to vascular endothelial integrins, leading to replication within endothelial cells.  Initial cytomegalovirus infections are often asymptomatic, but patients can develop a mononucleosis-type syndrome (eg, lethargy, fever, atypical lymphocytosis).  Psychosis and disorientation would be atypical. $#Educational objective# Rabies virus has a bullet-shaped envelope with knob-like glycoproteins that bind to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.  Once transmission occurs (usually due to a bite wound from an infected animal), the virus replicates locally in muscle tissue for several days or weeks before spreading in a retrograde fashion through the peripheral nerve axons to the central nervous system.

This prevents both nicotinic and muscarinic activation, leading to skeletal muscle weakness and reduced glandular secretions, respectively.  Foodborne botulism is a result of toxin ingestion and is characterized by cranial nerve deficits and descending symmetric paralysis.  #Spore formation#, which occurs in the #subterminal location# (in between the middle and end of the cell), allows the bacteria to survive adverse conditions (eg, heat, high-oxygen environment). $Focal dystonia is a localized, uncontrollable muscle contraction that can lead to pain and physical deformity.  #Torticollis# is a common manifestation of dystonia and is due to involvement of the #sternocleidomastoid# muscle.  Injection of botulinum toxin type B into the dystonic muscle results in muscular relaxation and #relief of symptoms#.  Botulinum toxin can also be used to treat the muscle spasms of multiple sclerosis and Parkinson disease, to relax the lower esophageal sphincter in achalasia, and to reduce the appearance of facial wrinkles.  The localized anticholinergic effect also makes it useful in the treatment of hyperhidrosis.  Effects are temporary (approximately 3 months) due to the regeneration of the nerve terminal with time. $#(Choice A)#  Hypervariable pili are characteristic of Neisseria meningitidis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae; antigenic heterogeneity aids in immune evasion and allows for repeat infections. $#(Choice B)#  The antiphagocytic capsule is a primary virulence factor for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Neisseria meningitidis. $#(Choice C)#  Some obligate intracellular organisms (eg, Chlamydia, mycobacteria) reproduce by forming small, metabolically inactive elementary bodies that are phagocytized by host cells.

Endotoxin is released with destruction of the bacterial cell wall (eg, antibiotics) or during cell division, in contrast to exotoxins which are often secreted (some exotoxins are release by bacterial lysis).

Bacterial meningitis is most commonly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis.  These pathogens colonize the host's mucous membranes, spread into the bloodstream (likely facilitated by this patient's preceeding viral infection), and penetrate the blood-brain barrier.  A lack of humoral components (eg, complement system, immunoglobulins) within the central nervous system allows bacteria to rapidly proliferate within the cerebrospinal fluid.  The resultant inflammatory response causes the classic #triad# of symptoms: #high fever# (>38 C [100.4 F]), #stiff neck#, and #altered level of consciousness#.  A generalized severe headache is also usually present. $Patients with suspected bacterial meningitis require urgent blood cultures, empiric antibiotics, and #lumbar puncture# with cerebrospinal fluid analysis to confirm the diagnosis, identify the underlying pathogen, and determine antibiotic sensitivity. $#(Choice A)#  100% oxygen can be used to abort cluster headaches, which are seen primarily in men and are usually characterized by severe orbital or periorbital pain, restless agitation, and autonomic symptoms (eg, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, ptosis, miosis).  Fever and nuchal rigidity would be atypical. $#(Choices C, E, and F)#  Metoclopramide and sumatriptan can be used to abort acute migraines; topiramate is an effective treatment for the prevention of chronic migraine headaches.  Migraines are usually characterized by a unilateral throbbing headache with or without associated symptoms such as nausea, aura, or photophobia.  Fever, nuchal rigidity, and lethargy would be atypical. $#(Choice D)#  Brain imaging may be performed prior to lumbar puncture to evaluate for signs of elevated intracranial pressure (increases the risk of cerebral herniation).  However, this patient had a negative head CT and further evaluation with MRI is not needed. $#Educational objective# The classic triad of fever, stiff neck, and altered mentation should raise suspicion for acute bacterial meningitis.

Neisseria meningitidis is a gram-negative diplococcus transmitted via aerosolized respiratory droplets.  Close living conditions (eg, college #dormitories#, prisons, military barracks) promote its spread. $N meningitidis has several virulence factors, including a polysaccharide capsule (impairs phagocytosis of the bacteria), lipo-oligosaccharide (induces cytokine production, leading to circulatory collapse), pili (permit bacterial attachment to the respiratory mucosa), and IgA protease (cleaves secretory IgA that would otherwise inactivate the pili).  Antibodies against the #polysaccharide capsule# confer immunity to N meningitidis. $The meningococcal #vaccines# available in the United States are as follows: $• Quadrivalent conjugate vaccine:  #Capsular polysaccharide antigens# (serogroups A, C, Y, and W) are fused to a diphtheroid toxin carrier, which allows the polysaccharides to be displayed on the major histocompatibility complex of antigen-presenting cells.  This results in stimulation of T-cells and provides a stronger, more lasting immunologic response. $• Serogroup B vaccine:  Capsular polysaccharides from serogroup B are very similar to human neural cell adhesion molecules.  This molecular mimicry prevented a polysaccharide vaccine due to difficulty in generating an immune response without increasing the risk of autoimmunity.  A vaccine against this serogroup is now available that uses #recombinant proteins# instead of capsular polysaccharides. $In the United States, the quadrivalent vaccine is part of routine immunizations; the serogroup B vaccine is recommended for specific high-risk populations (eg, those with asplenia or complement deficiency). $#(Choice B)#  The influenza vaccination typically contains three or four strains of inactivated virus.  Although influenza is often associated with rapid-onset malaise, headache, myalgia, and fever, the presence of nuchal rigidity and purpuric skin rash make meningococcemia more likely. $#(Choice C)#  The diphtheria toxoid is used in conjugate vaccines because it allows the polysaccharide antigen to be displayed on the major histocompatibility complex of antigen presenting cells.  The toxoid is not the primary antigenic component of conjugate vaccines. $#(Choice D)#  The measles-mumps-rubella vaccination contains live attenuated versions of these viruses.  @Measles@ is associated with the 3 C's (coryza, conjunctivitis, cough) and a maculopapular rash, mumps is associated with salivary gland swelling, and @rubella@ is associated with a diffuse maculopapular rash.  A purpuric rash and nuchal rigidity would be atypical. $#(Choice E)#  Virus-like particles are multiprotein structures that elicit a strong B- and T-cell response but contain no viral genetic material, so they are not infectious.  Virus-like particles are used in the hepatitis B and human papillomavirus vaccines. $#Educational objective# Antibodies against the polysaccharide capsule of Neisseria meningitidis provide immunity against this pathogen.  Quadrivalent meningococcal vaccines contain capsular polysaccharides from major serotypes (A, C, Y, and W) of N meningitidis.  Serotype B vaccinations use recombinant proteins.  ",

It is most often a primary disorder; however, in a patient from Central or South America, #secondary #achalasia due to #Chagas disease# should be suspected. $Chagas disease is caused by chronic infection with Trypanosoma cruzi, a slender C- or U-shaped flagellated parasite with darkly staining nucleus and kinetoplast.  Parasitosis-related inflammation and immune-mediated cross-reactivity between the parasite and the enteric ganglia lead to destruction of the submucosal (Meissner) and myenteric (Auerbach) plexus.  Denervation results in uncoordinated smooth muscle activity, increased esophageal tone, and incomplete lower esophageal relaxation.  Mechanical dilation (due to obstructed liquids and solids) proximal to the functional obstruction manifests as #megaesophagus#. $Patients classically experience dysphagia progressing from solids to liquids, odynophagia (due to food impaction), difficulty belching, regurgitation, and malnutrition.

In addition, patients are at higher risk for esophageal cancer. $#(Choices A and C)#  Immunocompromised patients (eg, advanced HIV) can develop infectious esophagitis.  Candida albicans causes exudative esophagitis, usually with concurrent oral thrush.  Cytomegalovirus causes ulcerative esophagitis in the distal esophagus.  Dysphagia and odynophagia are common with these disorders, but esophageal dilation and motility abnormalities are unexpected, and occurrence in immunocompetent patients is rare. $#(Choice B)#  Clostridium botulinum causes botulism, a paralytic disease resulting from neurotoxins that inhibit the release of acetylcholine from presynaptic nerve terminals.  Patients develop cranial nerve dysfunction and descending muscular weakness. $#(Choice D)#  Helicobacter pylori causes gastritis and peptic ulcer.  Typical manifestations include epigastric pain and nausea; however, H pylori does not usually cause esophageal disorders and is unlikely to cause esophageal dilation or absent peristalsis. $#(Choice E)#  Schistosoma mansoni is a parasite found in sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, South America, and the Caribbean that causes intestinal or hepatic schistosomiasis; this results in gastrointestinal illness (diarrhea, abdominal pain) or portal hypertension and cirrhosis, respectively. $#Educational objective# Chagas disease is caused by a chronic infection by Trypanosoma cruzi and causes secondary achalasia due to destruction of the submucosal (Meissner) and myenteric (Auerbach) plexus.

  "explanation_2": "Esophageal varices and splenomegaly are signs of #portal hypertension#, which usually indicates underlying hepatic fibrosis.  Although chronic viral hepatitis and alcohol abuse are the leading causes of hepatic fibrosis in the United States, this patient's immigration/travel history and eosinophilia raise suspicion for #hepatosplenic schistosomiasis#, a parasitic blood fluke infection seen primarily in rural parts of #sub-Saharan Africa# and East Asia. $Exposure to Schistosoma occurs when humans swim in freshwater contaminated by infected snails (the intermediate host).  Cercariae penetrate human skin and migrate to the liver, where they mature to adult worms.  Adult worms then spread through the #portal circulation# to the mesenteric venules or venous plexus of the bladder.  Here, they release eggs into host tissue that are excreted in the feces or urine. $Although many patients with schistosomiasis are asymptomatic, chronic exposure to Schistosoma eggs can activate hepatic stellate cells, leading to collagen deposition in periportal spaces and progressive #periportal fibrosis#.  Occlusion of periportal veins eventually blocks venous outflow from abdominal organs, leading to #congestive splenomegaly# and #gastroesophageal varices#.  Patients frequently have anemia from intestinal/variceal bleeding, thrombocytopenia from splenic trapping of platelets, and #eosinophilia# in response to adult worms. $#(Choice A)#  Cysticercosis is caused by ingestion of Taenia solium eggs from contaminated pork.  Although initial infections are usually asymptomatic, patients may develop seizures years or decades later due to calcified granulomas at the site of previous brain infection.  Muscle and subcutaneous tissue can also be involved, but the liver and hepatic venous system is generally not affected. $#(Choice B)#  Hookworm infection is a common cause of chronic, iron-deficiency anemia and eosinophilia, but this organism does not invade the liver or portal venous system; therefore, gastric varices and hepatosplenomegaly would be atypical. $#(Choice C)#  Malaria is common in patients who return to endemic areas (eg, sub-Saharan Africa) after being away (due to waning partial immunity).  Although hepatosplenomegaly and anemia are common, most patients are acutely ill (eg, fever, chills, malaise), and portal hypertension and eosinophilia are generally not present. $#(Choice E)#  Toxoplasmosis is most common in patients with AIDS.  It usually presents with meningoencephalitis (eg, confusion, headache, vomiting).  Upper gastrointestinal bleeding from esophageal varices and eosinophilia would be atypical. $#Educational objective# Schistosomiasis, a parasitic blood fluke infection, is common in rural portions of sub-Saharan Africa.  Initial infection is often asymptomatic, but some patients develop chronic hepatosplenic (eg, portal hypertension, hepatosplenomegaly, esophageal varices) or urinary (eg, bladder cancer) complications years or decades later.  The presence of eosinophilia is an important diagnostic clue.  "

C difficile is an anaerobic, spore-forming, toxigenic, gram-positive rod that causes infectious colitis.  The most significant risk factor for the development of CDI is antibiotic use.  Antibiotics (particularly clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, and cephalosporins) alter the normal bowel flora, thereby predisposing to C difficile overgrowth.  Other risk factors include hospitalization, older age, and proton pump inhibitor use. $C difficile produces 2 toxins:  Toxin A (enterotoxin) and Toxin B (cytotoxin).

  "explanation_2": "This patient's gastric nodules composed of small clonal B cells are indicative of an extranodal marginal zone lymphoma involving mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (#MALT lymphoma#).  This form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma arises from post–germinal center memory B cells, which typically express the markers found on all B cells (eg, CD19, CD20), as well as mature B-cell markers (eg, CD22). $Most MALT lymphomas are thought to arise due to #chronic immune stimulation# from bacterial, viral, or autoimmune conditions.  The most common trigger for gastric MALT lymphoma is #Helicobacter pylori infection#, which leads to local recruitment and proliferation of antigen-specific T and B lymphocytes.  Over time, chronic immune stimulation results in the emergence of a #monoclonal B-cell# line that proliferates excessively in the presence of H pylori antigens.  This cell line eventually accumulates genetic abnormalities that allow it to proliferate in an #antigen-independent fashion#, resulting in spread away from the local site of infection. $Because most cases of gastric MALT lymphoma are tightly linked to H pylori infection, antimicrobial treatment can often result in complete remission of early-stage disease due to elimination of the bacterial antigens driving tumor proliferation. $#(Choices B and E)#  Certain human papillomavirus (HPV) serotypes cause epithelial cancers of the head, neck, cervix, and anus.  Oncogenesis is mediated via production of the viral protein E6, which degrades host P53 protein, a promoter of cell repair after DNA damage and negative regulator of the cell cycle.  HPV also integrates into the host genome, resulting in DNA damage that contributes to oncogenesis. $#(Choice C)#  Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a lymphotropic, oncogenic virus associated with certain B- and T-cell lymphomas.  In latent EBV infection, episomal EBV DNA generates low levels of viral proteins that allow it to evade the host immune response.  The viral proteins also activate proliferation-promoting and antiapoptotic host genes, leading to oncogenesis in a minority of cases. $#(Choice D)#  Within B cells, somatic hypermutation at the variable region of the immunoglobulin gene allows the generation of diverse antibodies.  Hypermutation allows for B-cell production of high-affinity immunoglobulins against the immunizing antigen; they are not a cause of oncogenesis in MALT lymphomas (which arise from post-germinal center memory B cells). $#Educational objective# Helicobacter pylori is associated with gastric MALT lymphoma due to chronic stimulation of the immune response; the continuous cell division predisposes to accumulation of mutations that result in aberrant B-cell proliferation.  Treatment of H pylori can induce remission in the majority of cases of early-stage gastric MALT lymphomas.  "

Transmission occurs from prolonged skin-to-skin contact with an infected individual but may occasionally occur due to contact with contaminated fomites (eg, bedsheets, clothing).  Mites #burrow under the epidermis# and evoke a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to mite feces and eggs, which leads to an intensely #pruritic rash#.  The mites can often be seen on microscopy. $Classic scabies is associated with a mild mite burden (10-15 mites).  Patients usually have several small erythematous @papules@ on the sides/webs of the fingers, wrists, elbows, axillae, waist, and genitalia.  #Excoriations# and #burrows# (thin, serpiginous red tracks) may be seen.  In contrast, patients with impaired cell-mediated immunity (eg, #HIV#) are unable to contain the infection and usually develop @crusted scabies@, which is associated with thousands or #millions of mites#.  These patients often have mild pruritus (because the inflammatory response is muted) and several erythematous patches with scaling and crusting. $Treatment is required to prevent discomfort, transmission, and potential complications (eg, secondary bacterial infection).  First-line therapy includes #topical permethrin#, which blocks mite neurotransmission by impairing voltage-gated sodium channels.

Head lice require multiple blood meals a day and die within 2 days if separated from a host.  They do not carry arthropod-borne infection, but the bite can induce a pruritic allergic reaction. $Female lice attach their nits to the hair shaft about 0.5 cm from the skin surface; nits further from the surface often represent old egg casings that have hatched and generally do not require treatment.  First-line treatment includes #topical pediculicides# (eg, permethrin, ivermectin).

The louse is adapted for attaching to thick hair shafts, and the nits are usually found on pubic and other thick hair (eg, eyelashes); however, scalp hair is not typically affected. $#(Choice E)#  Sarcoptes scabiei causes scabies, which presents with pruritic papules and burrows on the interdigital and flexural skin of the extremities.  The female mite lays eggs in burrows and does not form nits. $#(Choice F)#  Trichophyton tonsurans is a dermatophyte that causes tinea capitis, which presents as a scaly, erythematous patch of hair loss.  There are often small, black dots that represent broken hair shafts. $#Educational objective# Pediculus humanus capitis (ie, head lice) infestation is common in school children and adults who come into close contact with infested individuals.

  "explanation_2": "This patient has a vesicular rash consistent with #herpes zoster# (shingles), which is caused by @reactivation@ of latent varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection.  Following the primary infection (#chickenpox#), VZV remains dormant in the #dorsal root ganglia# until emerging decades later.  Decreased cell-mediated immunity (eg, older age, immunosuppressive medications, HIV infection) increases the risk of reactivation. $Reactivation of VZV causes hemorrhagic inflammation of the dorsal root ganglion and peripheral nerve.  The resulting hypersensitive nerve function presents with #neuropathic pain# in the affected region (herpetic neuralgia), typically described as stabbing, tingling, or burning.  Herpetic neuralgia can begin even before the appearance of skin lesions and may persist for up to several months.  A minority of patients experience #long-term residual pain#, termed #postherpetic neuralgia#; the risk is greater in older patients (age >70) and those with more severe shingles. $#(Choice A)#  Primary VZV infection is characterized by a diffuse vesicular rash (chickenpox), but reactivation is dermatomal.  Generalized reactivation or spread to other body areas can occur in immune-compromised patients but is extremely rare in healthy individuals. $#(Choice B)#  Reactive arthritis presents with an asymmetric peripheral oligoarthritis, often with extraarticular symptoms (eg, uveitis, conjunctivitis, urethritis).  It typically follows bacterial gastrointestinal (eg, Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter) or genitourinary (eg, Chlamydia) infection. $#(Choice D)#  IgA nephropathy produces recurrent glomerulonephritis and typically presents with episodic hematuria.  Common triggers include upper respiratory illness, but shingles does not typically exacerbate the condition. $#(Choice E)#  Toxic or metabolic nerve injury (eg, diabetic peripheral neuropathy) is typically proportionate to the length of the sensory nerve fibers.  Symptoms appear first in the longest nerves, such as those to the feet and hands, causing a \"glove and stocking\" distribution.  However, because reactivation of VZV occurs only in specific sensory ganglia, symptoms have a dermatomal distribution. $#Educational objective# A unilateral vesicular rash localized on a single dermatome in an older patient is most likely herpes zoster.  Postherpetic neuralgia is the most common neurologic complication of varicella zoster virus infection.  ",

  "explanation_2": "This patient, who developed a serpiginous, pruritic rash shortly after walking barefoot on a beach, likely has #hookworm infection#.  Hookworms spread when #egg-containing feces# are deposited into shady, warm, moist sand or soil.  Eggs hatch into larvae and are transmitted when they come into #direct contact with human skin# (eg, when walking barefoot). $Dermal penetration is usually marked by a #pruritic maculopapular lesion# (\"ground itch\") at the site of larval entry (eg, foot, toe webs).  Spread of larvae through the adjacent dermal tissue can lead to the formation of migrating, reddish-brown, #serpiginous tracks#.  Deeper spread may occur, depending on the species of infecting hookworm, as follows: $• @Human hookworms@ (eg, Necator americanus, A duodenale) penetrate the basement membrane and spread from the dermis to the bloodstream.  They rupture into the alveoli and are coughed up and swallowed into the small intestine.  There, larvae mature into adult hookworms that feed on blood from the duodenal mucosa (often causing iron deficiency anemia) and shed up to 10,000 eggs/day, thereby spreading the infection to others. $• Cat and dog hookworms (eg, Ancylostoma braziliense, A caninum) cause a dermal eruption in humans but are unable to penetrate the cutaneous basement membrane and spread to deeper tissues.  Therefore, larvae do not mature into adult hookworms or spread from human-to-human (humans are incidental hosts). $#(Choice A)#  A brown recluse spider bite usually appears as a red plaque or papule with central pallor; it may develop a dark central eschar that ulcerates due to necrosis.  Pain is often severe. $#(Choice C)#  Mycobacterium marinum lesions usually form a few weeks after exposure to contaminated fresh/salt water (eg, swimming pool, fish tank).  Lesions begin as solitary papules or nodules that eventually ulcerate and scar.  Serpiginous tracts would be uncommon. $#(Choice D)#  Sporothrix schenckii, a dimorphic fungus, is usually transmitted when contaminated organic material (eg, moss, soil) is inoculated into the skin or subcutaneous tissue.  A papule forms at the inoculation site and usually ulcerates; additional lesions form along the proximal route of lymphatic drainage. $#(Choice E)#  Staphylococcus aureus is the most common cause of purulent cellulitis.  Lesions tend to develop over days and are characterized by painful areas of fluctuance with surrounding erythema. $#(Choice F)#  Vibrio vulnificus is a free-living bacterium that grows in brackish water and marine environments.

Macrophage signaling to kill M leprae is limited, leading to mycobacterial dissemination.  Manifestations include diffuse skin thickening, plaque-like hypopigmentation (often with hair loss), leonine facies, paresis, regional anesthesia, testicular destruction, and blindness. $M leprae grows best at temperatures below core body temperature, partially explaining why leprosy manifests in the skin, superficial nerves (eg, Schwann cells in this patient), eyes, and testes.  Intermediate features between TT and LL are often seen. $#(Choice A)#  Borrelia burgdorferi causes Lyme disease.  Symptoms include a characteristic skin rash (erythema chronicum migrans) with fever and malaise.  Systemic disease can progress to cause arthritis, facial paresis, or cardiac involvement (eg, conduction abnormalities).  Prolonged untreated disease can lead to central nervous system involvement. $#(Choice B)#  Campylobacter fetus, a gram-negative rod, causes mild enteritis in immunocompetent patients and mild systemic bacteremic illness in immunocompromised patients. $#(Choice C)#  Corynebacterium diphtheriae is a gram-positive rod that causes diphtheria, a primarily toxin-mediated lower respiratory tract infection that is sometimes complicated by polyneuritis and myocarditis. $#(Choice E)#  Treponema pallidum causes syphilis.

The trichomonads infect the squamous epithelium of the vagina, resulting in vulvovaginal inflammation and subsequent vulvar pruritus, dyspareunia, #vulvovaginal erythema#, and discharge. $#Wet mount saline microscopy# of @trichomoniasis@ typically shows characteristic #motile, flagellated protozoans#.  Nucleic acid amplification testing can also be performed and is the gold standard.  Treatment of the patient and the patient's sexual partners is with metronidazole. $#(Choice A)#  Cervical cytology (ie, Pap test) is a screening test for cervical cancer.  Most patients with high-grade cervical lesions or cervical cancer are asymptomatic; patients with symptoms typically present with postcoital bleeding or a mucopurulent cervical discharge with an associated cervical lesion. $#(Choice B)#  @Neisseria gonorrhoeae@is a common sexually transmitted infection that may present with mucopurulent (not frothy) vaginal discharge originating from an inflamed cervix.  A Gram stain may show gram-negative diplococci in polymorphonuclear leukocytes.  Gram staining is not performed for T vaginalis because the process often changes the organism's shape, making it difficult to identify. $#(Choice C and E)#  pH and whiff tests can be used to diagnose bacterial vaginosis, which typically presents with thin, off-white, malodorous discharge with no associated vaginitis.  In bacterial vaginosis, the addition of potassium hydroxide (KOH) to the vaginal discharge releases amines, causing a characteristic odor (eg, positive whiff test).  Vaginal pH is elevated in both bacterial vaginosis and trichomonas infection; therefore, pH testing is not specific for diagnosis. $#(Choice D)#  Urine culture is used to diagnose urinary tract infections, which can present with dysuria; however, patients do not have associated vaginal discharge. $#Educational objective# Trichomonas vaginalis is a sexually transmitted motile protozoan which can be seen on wet mount microscopy of vaginal discharge.

  "explanation_2": "This patient with an erythematous tympanic membrane and purulent otorrhea has #acute otitis media# (AOM) complicated by tympanic membrane perforation, which can be obscured due to drainage.  Acute @middle ear infections@ occur most commonly in young children (age 6 months to 2 years) and are often due to #Streptococcus pneumoniae#. $A #viral upper respiratory infection# (URI) typically precedes the development of AOM because it causes inflammatory edema of the respiratory mucosa that can lead to #obstruction of the eustachian tube#.  The eustachian tube normally opens to equalize middle ear pressure and drain secretions.  Therefore, obstruction leads to the #accumulation of secretions#, providing a rich medium for bacterial growth.  #Bacterial colonizers# of the upper respiratory tract (eg, S pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis) then proliferate in the middle ear secretions.  This overgrowth of bacteria and consequent immune response result in AOM. $Suppurative fluid accumulation increases middle ear pressure and causes the tympanic membrane to become inflamed and bulge outward.  If the eustachian tube remains obstructed, this increased pressure can @rupture the tympanic membrane@. $#(Choice A)#  Although Klebsiella pneumoniae can be a colonizer of the mouth and throat, it is unlikely to cause AOM in otherwise healthy children.  Instead, it more often causes respiratory diseases in older, immunosuppressed patients (eg, pneumonia in patients with alcohol overuse). $#(Choice B)#  Moraxella catarrhalis is also an upper respiratory colonizer that can cause AOM.  However, infection with it is less common than with S pneumoniae. $#(Choice C)#  Proteus mirabilis classically causes genitourinary infections; its ability to split urea alkalinizes the urine, increasing the formation of kidney stones. $#(Choice D)#  Pseudomonas aeruginosa is more commonly implicated in @otitis externa@ than AOM. $#(Choice E)#  Staphylococcus aureus is typically found as a colonizer of the skin rather than the respiratory tract.  Therefore, it is more often implicated in skin and soft tissue infections, including otitis externa. $#Educational objective# Acute otitis media usually occurs after a viral upper respiratory infection causes obstruction of the eustachian tube.  This obstruction leads to the accumulation of secretions, which encourages bacterial growth.  The most common bacterial causes are respiratory colonizers, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis.  ",

  "explanation_2": "For an RNA molecule #purified# from a virus (ie, without viral capsid or envelope) to be infectious (ie, able to induce viral protein synthesis and genome replication in the host cell) on its own, it must act as mRNA capable of using the host's intracellular machinery for translation.  In other words, the purified RNA molecule must be #single-stranded# (SS) and #positive (+) sense#, or SS(+).  The question describes a naked (ie, nonenveloped) virus with SS(+) RNA.  Of the viruses listed, only rhinovirus (a picornavirus) has these features.  Generally, only RNA molecules purified from SS(+) viruses are infectious; purified SS negative (–) sense RNA molecules and double-stranded (ds) RNA molecules are not as they require additional enzymes. $#(Choice A)#  HIV is a retrovirus that contains SS(+) RNA.  However, viral infectivity requires the action of reverse transcriptase for integration into the host genome; purified RNA by itself cannot cause infection.  In addition, HIV is enveloped, unlike the particles isolated from this patient. $#(Choices B and C)#  Influenza A is an orthomyxovirus that contains SS(–) RNA; similarly, respiratory syncytial virus is a paramyxovirus that contains SS(–) RNA.  For these viruses to replicate in a host cell, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase must also gain entry into the host cell. $#(Choice E)#  Rotavirus is a reovirus containing dsRNA.  Its purified RNA is therefore incapable of inducing viral protein synthesis in a host cell on its own (ie, it is non-infectious).  For this virus to replicate in a host cell, a specific viral RNA polymerase present in the intact virion must also gain entry into the host cell. $#Educational objective# For a purified RNA molecule to induce viral protein synthesis in a host cell, it must be able to act directly as mRNA using the host's intracellular machinery for translation.  Therefore, in general, purified single-stranded positive-sense RNA can be infectious; single-stranded negative sense or double-stranded RNA is not.  "

  "explanation_2": "This patient has rapidly progressive pain, swelling, and gas/necrosis at the site of a penetrating foot injury, raising strong suspicion for #Clostridium perfringens# infection.  C perfringens is an obligate anaerobic, spore-forming, #gram-positive rod# found in soil.  Most cases develop following the introduction of spores into tissue during #penetrating injury# (eg, knife wound, puncture wound); significant vascular damage is generally required to create the #anaerobic environment# necessary for vegetative bacterial proliferation. $C perfringens classically causes #gas gangrene# (eg, necrosis, gas in tissue) #within hours# of infection.  This is primarily mediated by the generation of #alpha toxin# (lecithinase), a potent phospholipase C mimetic that #splits host phospholipids#.  This compound hydrolyzes lecithin-containing lipoprotein complexes in cell membranes, which causes cell lysis, tissue necrosis, and edema.  It also mediates intravascular aggregations of platelets, neutrophils, and fibrin, which results in vascular occlusion and further promotes the anaerobic environment required for bacterial proliferation.  Although C perfringens produces a vast array of other cytotoxins, alpha toxin is thought to mediate its most devastating effects. $C perfringens uses #carbohydrates# for energy; its rapid metabolism of muscle tissue carbohydrates produces significant amounts of #gas#, which can be seen on plain radiographs or CT scans #(choice B).# $#(Choice A)#  Actin depolymerization is mediated by Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile cytotoxin B, which primarily causes infectious diarrhea. $#(Choice C)#  Inactivation of elongation factor 2 through ribosylation is the mechanism of action for diphtheria toxin.  Cutaneous diphtheria is generally marked by nonhealing ulcers; it does not typically cause rapid-onset necrosis and gas formation. $#(Choice E)#  Plasminogen activators such as streptokinase, urokinase, and tissue plasminogen activator convert plasminogen to plasmin.  Of these 3 enzymes, only streptokinase, an exotoxin released by Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus), is a bacterial product.  Streptococcal skin infection is usually marked by spreading, nonpurulent cellulitis, not gas gangrene. $#(Choice F)#  Inhibition of presynaptic acetylcholine release is the mechanism of action of botulinum toxin, which primarily causes cranial neuropathy and descending paralysis. $#(Choice G)#  Certain Staphylococcus aureus–produced toxins act as superantigens by hyperstimulating T cells and causing massive cytokine production.  Examples include enterotoxin, which causes food poisoning, and toxic shock syndrome toxin.  S aureus can cause purulent cellulitis, but rapid-onset gas gangrene is atypical. $#Educational objective# Lecithinase (alpha toxin) is the main toxin produced by Clostridium perfringens.  It degrades lecithin, a component of cellular phospholipid membranes, which leads to membrane destruction, cell death, and widespread necrosis and hemolysis.  "

Although a handful of fairly uncommon pathogens (eg, Mycobacterium marinum, Nocardia, Leishmania) can cause nodular lymphangitis, the most likely pathogen in this case is #Sporothrix schenckii#. $S schenckii is a dimorphic fungus that exists as #cigar-shaped yeasts# at body temperature and reproduces by #narrow-based budding#.  It exists as a mold in the environment and tends to grow in #decaying plant matter and soil#, particularly on sphagnum moss, hay, and decaying wood.  Transmission typically occurs when the organism is introduced into cutaneous or subcutaneous tissue while a person is farming, landscaping, or gardening. $Manifestations of infection progress slowly over days or weeks and usually begin with a #painless papule# at the site of inoculation that eventually ulcerates; notably, the lesion does #not drain pus# or odorous material.  Similar lesions arise over several days more proximally along the lymphatic channel.  Systemic symptoms (eg, fever) do not generally occur.  Most cases can be diagnosed clinically, but culture of a sample from a lesion can definitively identify the organism. $#(Choice A)#  Bat guano can carry Histoplasma capsulatum, which typically causes a mild, subacute pulmonary infection.  Nodular lesions can develop as part of disseminated infection, but lesions are usually bilateral and do not exhibit proximal spread.  In addition, disseminated infections are almost always seen in severely immunocompromised patients (eg, AIDS). $#(Choice C)#  Mycobacterium marinum is an uncommon pathogen that causes infection following inoculation of a wound with contaminated freshwater or seawater.  Most cases are marked by a solitary papule that ulcerates, but nodular lymphangitis can occasionally occur.  However, acid-fast bacilli, not yeasts, would be seen on culture. $#(Choice D)#  Prolonged antibiotic use can disrupt mucocutaneous flora, leading to Candida infection.  Although Candida is a yeast that buds, it generally causes intertriginous infection marked by erythematous plaques and erosions.  Nodular lymphangitis would be uncommon. $#(Choice E)#  Feline flea bite can transmit Bartonella henselae, the cause of catscratch disease.  Patients often develop a papule at the inoculation site, but the major symptom is extremely tender regional lymphadenitis.  Gram-negative rods, not yeasts, would be seen on culture. $#Educational objective# Sporothrix schenckii is a dimorphic fungus that exists as yeasts at body temperature.

  "explanation_2": "Patients with #sickle cell anemia# have mutations in the beta-globulin gene that cause hemoglobin to reversibly polymerize when deoxygenated, which leads to the formation of @sickled-shaped erythrocytes@ that clog small capillaries and cause end-organ ischemia.  The spleen is particularly vulnerable; repeated microinfarction of splenic vascular beds usually results in #functional asplenia# within the first 18-36 months of life. $Because the spleen produces opsonizing antibodies that are important for clearing #encapsulated bacteria #from the blood, asplenia is associated with significant risk of fulminant bacterial infections.  #Streptococcus pneumoniae# is the leading pathogen, but Neisseria meningitidis and Haemophilus influenzae are also frequently isolated.  Therefore, patients with sickle cell anemia who present with signs/symptoms of infection (eg, fever, chills, leukocytosis) require urgent empiric antibiotic therapy that covers these pathogens.  Vaccination (pneumococcal and Haemophilus influenzae type b) is recommended to reduce risk of future infection. $#(Choices A, B, C, E, and F)#  Patients with sickle cell anemia are at increased risk for overwhelming bacterial infections with a variety of pathogens.  However, S pneumoniae infections are particularly common, accounting for 40%-60% of total bacterial infections in this population.  Although Pseudomonas aeruginosa is encapsulated, it is not a common pathogen in patients with sickle cell disease (it occurs more often in those with cystic fibrosis, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes mellitus).  Patients with sickle cell anemia are also particularly prone to salmonella osteomyelitis. $#Educational objective# Patients with sickle cell disease become functionally asplenic within the first few years of life due to repeated microinfarction of splenic vascular beds.  This dramatically increases the risk for fulminant infections with encapsulated bacterial organisms, particularly Streptococcus pneumoniae.  Patients with sickle cell disease are also at increased risk for other bacterial infections, most notably salmonella osteomyelitis.  ",

  "explanation_2": "$#Mycoplasma pneumoniae# is a common cause of tracheobronchitis and walking pneumonia.  It attacks the respiratory epithelium by binding to an oligosaccharide (#I-antigen#) that is also present on the surface of erythrocytes.  This leads to the formation of #cross-reacting IgM antibodies# that attach to red blood cells, activate the complement system, and cause erythrocyte lysis. $The cross-reacting antibodies are called #cold agglutinins# because they bind to erythrocytes in areas where the blood temperature is below core body temperature (eg, distal extremities, nose).  Most patients with cold agglutinins are asymptomatic, but some develop manifestations of intravascular #hemolytic anemia# such as elevated reticulocyte count and lactate dehydrogenase level.  IgM titers usually begin to fall approximately 4 weeks after initial infection leading to a resolution of the hemolytic anemia (within 8 weeks). $Other extrapulmonary manifestations of M pneumoniae include Stevens-Johnson syndrome, joint pain, encephalitis, cardiac rhythm disturbances, and bullous myringitis. $#(Choice A)#  M pneumoniae is an atypical bacterium; it has a plasma membrane composed of cholesterol (unlike most bacteria) and no cell wall.  The lack of a cell wall makes this pathogen resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. $#(Choice B)#  Malaria and babesiosis are associated with intraerythrocytic organisms that can cause cell lysis and anemia.  However, these pathogens usually cause high fever and more severe clinical syndromes.  In addition, azithromycin monotherapy is not an effective cure for these infections. $#(Choice D)#  Iron deficiency anemia, which is most commonly due to blood loss, can often be improved by replenishing body iron stores (eg, oral iron supplementation).  Chronic infection or inflammatory conditions can be associated with anemia of chronic disease, which is due to impaired utilization of iron (not absolute iron deficiency). $#(Choice E)#  Enzyme deficiencies that cause anemia include glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and pyruvate kinase deficiency.  Infection and medications that cause oxidative stress (eg, sulfonamides, antimalarial agents) can cause hemolysis in patients with G6PD; however, G6PD is an X-linked disorder (it is seen in men). $#Educational objective# Mycoplasma pneumoniae binds an oligosaccharide on the respiratory epithelium that is also present on erythrocytes, leading to the generation of cross-reacting IgM antibodies (cold agglutinins).  Patients with M pneumoniae infections often develop mild, transient hemolytic anemia that resolves as IgM antibody titers decline (6-8 weeks after infection begins).  "

However, infection can also be asymptomatic, which likely occurred in this case. $Prevention of CRS is achieved by preventing maternal illness.  Maternal rubella infection is rare in the United States because of universal childhood vaccination with the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.  However, lack of immunization programs in certain areas (eg, Southeast Asia, Africa) is associated with higher rates of CRS. $In contrast to killed vaccines that induce only humoral immunity, the rubella vaccine is a #live attenuated vaccine# and therefore induces both humoral and cell-mediated immunity #(choice A).#  Vaccination should be administered #prior to conception# because live attenuated vaccines carry the potential risk of viral transmission to the fetus if given during pregnancy. $#(Choice C)#  Maternal perinatal antibiotic treatment is indicated for chorioamnionitis and group B Streptococcus colonization, which are risk factors for neonatal sepsis.

  "explanation_2": "This patient has #herpes zoster ophthalmicus#, a condition caused by reactivation of latent #varicella-zoster virus# (VZV) in the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve (@CN V1@). $Following primary VZV infection (ie, chickenpox), the virus is transported retrograde along sensory nerves to cranial nerve and dorsal spinal ganglia, where it lies dormant for years.  @Reactivation@ of the virus most commonly occurs in #elderly #or immunosuppressed patients and typically causes sensory disturbances (eg, burning or shooting pains) and eruption of a #painful rash# (eg, scattered vesicles) in the #associated dermatome# (eg, unilateral forehead, side of the nose, periorbital area).  A prodrome of systemic symptoms (eg, headache, malaise, fever) can also occur. $Because CN V1 also conveys sensory innervation of the cornea (sensory limb of the corneal/blink reflex), involvement can cause #acute keratitis# (ie, corneal inflammation) and #corneal ulceration# (eg, linear, branching ulcerations on fluorescein stain).  Involvement of the side or tip of the nose (ie, Hutchinson sign) correlates highly with ocular involvement because the nasociliary branch of CN V1 innervates both the eye and the side/tip of the nose. $#(Choice A)#  Viral conjunctivitis is most commonly caused by adenovirus.  It typically presents with monocular conjunctival erythema and eye discomfort; scattered skin vesicles and corneal ulcerations would not be seen. $#(Choice B)#  Hematogenous dissemination of Candida albicans can cause fungal endophthalmitis.  The fungus typically seeds the highly vascular choroid then spreads to the retina and fluid chambers, manifesting as floaters and progressively decreasing vision.  Eye pain is rare until late in the disease process, and corneal ulceration does not typically occur. $#(Choices C and D)#  Herpes simplex virus is a common cause of keratitis and can occur in healthy adults, although immunodeficiency increases the risk.  Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common cause of bacterial keratitis, especially in contact lens users.  Both can cause corneal ulceration, leading to eye pain, redness, and decreased vision.  However, neither causes a vesicular, dermatomal rash. $#Educational objective# Herpes zoster ophthalmicus is caused by reactivation of varicella-zoster virus in the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V1).  It is characterized by a painful, dermatomal rash and ocular involvement (eg, acute keratitis, corneal ulceration).  It most commonly occurs in elderly and immunosuppressed patients.  ",

In this case, the patient's lack of systemic symptoms, absence of penile discharge, and positive urine dipstick analysis are consistent with UTI. $The most common cause of UTI is fecal florae, including gram-negative rods (eg, #Escherichia coli [most common]#) and gram-positive cocci (eg, Enterococcus faecalis).  Female patients are at highest risk because their urethra is short and close to the anus, but male patients with a history of insertive anal intercourse are also at increased risk. $Urinalysis findings often provide diagnostic insight in identifying the causal bacterium: $• #Leukocyte esterase:#  Leukocyte esterase is an enzyme released by lysed white blood cells and is a marker of inflammation.  Although nonspecific, its presence is supportive of UTI. $• #Nitrite:#  Nitrites are a metabolic by-product of #bacteria producing nitrate reductase#, an enzyme that reduces normal urinary nitrate (NO3−) to nitrite (NO2−).  These bacteria include Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis.  Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus do not produce nitrate reductase, making their presence inconsistent with this patient's positive urinary nitrites #(choices B and F)#. $• #pH:#  Alkaline urine (pH >8) in the setting of UTI is suggestive of a bacterium that produces urease (eg, Proteus mirabilis); urease hydrolyzes urea to ammonia (NH3), which is then protonated to ammonium (NH4+), alkalizing the urine.  This helps differentiate P mirabilis from other nitrate reductase–producing bacteria.  In this case, the patient has a #relatively acidic# (ie, pH = 5) urine, a finding that makes infection with P mirabilis unlikely #(choice E).# $This patient's dipstick analysis with positive leukocyte esterase, nitrites, and a mildly acidic pH is most consistent with an Escherichia coli UTI. $#(Choice A)#  UTI with Candida albicans is generally seen only in elderly, hospitalized, and immunocompromised patients.  In addition, dipstick analysis would be positive for leukocyte esterase but negative for nitrites. $#(Choice D)#  Genital herpes simplex virus infection typically presents with clusters of vesicles (not seen in this patient) that may cause dysuria.  Leukocyte esterase may be present in the urine, but nitrites would not. $#Educational objective# The most common cause of urinary tract infection is Escherichia coli, a nitrate reductase–producing bacterium.

He subsequently experienced overwhelming #asplenic sepsis#, a condition that carries a 50% mortality risk. $The #spleen# is a part of the systemic lymphoid system and receives roughly 6% of the cardiac output.  Many of the splenic capillaries are open-ended and sinusoidal, permitting whole blood to flow into the red pulp cords.  These cords form a reticular meshwork that acts as a fine sieve with spaces as small as 1 micron in diameter.  Large numbers of macrophages line the red pulp cords and sinusoids and ingest any particulate matter that becomes trapped.  The splenic red pulp is important for:  $1. Destroying aged and #abnormal erythrocytes# (eg, spherocytes) and serving as an emergency store of blood cells and platelets that can be delivered into the circulation when needed.  $2. Clearance of #circulating bacteria# that become lodged in the cords.

Patients experience recurrent suppurative infections (eg, abscesses). $#(Choice E)#  Interferons α and β are released from virally-infected cells and cause macrophage and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activation, leading to destruction of infected cells.  Defects in type I interferon release lead to increased susceptibility to viral infections. $#Educational objective# The spleen acts as both a blood filter capable of removing circulating pathogens and as a major site of opsonizing antibody synthesis.
