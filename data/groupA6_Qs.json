Eukaryotic pre-mRNA undergoes significant posttranscriptional processing before leaving the nucleus, including 5'-capping, poly A tail addition, and intron splicing. $Once mRNA is finalized, it leaves the nucleus bound to specific packaging proteins.  Upon entering the cytoplasm, these mRNA complexes often associate with ribosomes to undergo translation.  However, certain mRNA sequences instead associate with proteins that are found in P bodies.  P bodies are distinct foci found within eukaryotic cells that are involved in mRNA regulation and turnover.  They play a fundamental role in translation repression and mRNA decay, and contain numerous proteins including RNA exonucleases, mRNA decapping enzymes, and constituents involved in mRNA quality control and microRNA-induced mRNA silencing.  P bodies also seem to function as a form of mRNA storage, as certain mRNAs are incorporated into P bodies only to be later released and utilized for protein translation. $#(Choices A and B)#  The 5' end of all mRNA is capped with a 7-methylguanosine residue by a unique 5' to 5' linkage, which occurs in two stages.  The first step is the addition of guanine triphosphate to the 5' end of mRNA in a reaction catalyzed by guanylyltransferase.  Methylation of the guanosine cap is then catalyzed by guanine-7-methyltransferase.  Capping of the precursor RNA occurs in the nucleus as the RNA is being transcribed.  This methylated cap protects mRNA from degradation by cellular exonucleases, and allows it to exit the nucleus. $#(Choice C)#  mRNA is polyadenylated at the 3' end by the polyadenylate polymerase complex, which recognizes a specific sequence (AAUAAA), cleaves the pre-mRNA molecule a few residues downstream from this sequence, and then adds a stretch of 20 - 250 adenine residues called the poly A tail.  The addition of the poly A tail occurs before the mRNA exits the nucleus.  In the cytosol, the poly A tail is gradually shortened, eventually leading to mRNA degradation. $#(Choices D and E)#  Since pre-mRNA contains both introns and exons, and only exons code for proteins, introns must be excised before translation through a process known as splicing.  Splicing of pre-mRNA occurs within the nucleus and is facilitated by the interaction of pre-mRNA with small ribonucleoprotein particles called snRNPs (or \"snurps\" for short). $#Educational objective# When mRNA is first transcribed from DNA, it is in an unprocessed form called pre-mRNA or heterogeneous nuclear mRNA (hnRNA).  Several processing steps are required before finalized mRNA molecules can leave the nucleus, including 5'-capping, poly A tail addition, and intron splicing.  Cytoplasmic P bodies play an important role in mRNA translation regulation and mRNA degradation.  "

  "explanation_2": "$In the experiment described above, the poly-A tail on mature mRNA is most likely to bind the latex beads because the adenine residues in this tail would form complementary base pairs with the repeated deoxythymine residues fixed to the beads. $#Mature mRNA# refers to mRNA that has been processed and is ready for nuclear export and translation into protein.  mRNA processing (#post-transcriptional modification#) involves the following steps:  $1. 5' capping: A 7-methyl-guanosine cap is added to the 5' end of the mRNA.  $2. Polyadenylation: A #poly-A tail# (chain of adenine residues) is added to most eukaryotic mRNA molecules by poly-A polymerase.  Poly-A tails are not transcribed from the DNA template.  Instead, a #consensus sequence (AAUAAA)# located near the #3'# end of the RNA molecule directs the addition of the poly-A tail.  This tail protects the mRNA from degradation within the cytoplasm after it exits the nucleus.  $3. Splicing: The initial mRNA transcript (pre-mRNA) contains sequences from coding and noncoding regions of DNA, known as exons and introns, respectively.  Spliceosomes (complexes of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins [snRNPs] and other proteins) remove introns containing GU at the 5' splice site and AG at the 3' splice site #(choice E).# $#(Choice A)#  Aminoacyl-tRNA is tRNA charged with its amino acid.  The cloverleaf structure of tRNA consists of a 3' CCA tail (amino acid binding site); a T loop abundant in ribothymidine, pseudouridine, and cytidine residues; a D loop rich in dihydrouridine residues; and an anticodon loop. $#(Choice C)#  DNA promoter regions help initiate transcription by binding transcription factors and RNA polymerase II.  Promoter regions contain consensus sequences that are typically AT-rich (eg, TATA and CAAT boxes) or GC-rich (eg, GC box). $#(Choice D)#  Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is a component of the ribosome that catalyzes peptide bond formation during translation. $#(Choice F)#  Telomeres are located at the ends of chromosomes and contain TTAGGG repeats, which are added by the enzyme telomerase (RNA-dependent DNA polymerase).  Critical shortening in telomere length is thought to signal programmed cell death. $#Educational objective# The poly-A tail is not transcribed from DNA; instead, it is added as a post-transcriptional modification downstream of the consensus sequence (AAUAAA) located near the 3' end of the mRNA molecule.  This tail protects mRNA from degradation within the cytoplasm after it exits the nucleus.  "

  "explanation_2": "@DNA replication@ is coordinated by the actions of multiple enzymes and proteins.  It requires a high degree of fidelity to ensure preservation of the genetic code in daughter cells and to prevent accumulation of mutations. $Prokaryotes have 3 types of #DNA polymerase# (I, II, III), all of which perform the following functions: $• #DNA synthesis# (#5′ → 3′ polymerase# activity):  DNA chain synthesis and elongation first require the presence of an RNA primer (created by an RNA polymerase, or primase).  DNA polymerases then add individual nucleotides to the 3′ end of the growing daughter strand. $• #Proofreading# (#3′ → 5′ exonuclease# activity):  As the DNA daughter strand is synthesized, DNA polymerases check that each added nucleotide is appropriately matched to its complementary base.  Incorrect base pairs are removed (via hydrolysis of their phosphodiester bonds), and the correct complementary bases are added. $In this experiment, the researcher most likely observed #removal of mismatched base pairs# during DNA replication to conclude that DNA polymerase III has 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity. $#(Choice A)#  During DNA replication in prokaryotes, the circular DNA strands are unwound, creating tension.  DNA gyrase (type II topoisomerase) temporarily cleaves both strands of the DNA double helix and introduces negative supercoils to relieve this tension. $#(Choice B)#  Ultraviolet (UV) light can damage DNA by covalently bonding adjacent pyrimidine (typically thymine) bases to form dimers.  These thymine dimers are usually removed via nucleotide excision repair by the enzyme UV-specific endonuclease. $#(Choice D)#  A unique function of DNA polymerase I is its 5′ to 3′ exonuclease activity, which is used to remove the RNA primer synthesized by RNA primase.  DNA polymerase III does not have 5′ to 3′ exonuclease activity. $#(Choice E)#  Helicase promotes unwinding and dissociation of parent DNA strands at the replication fork. $#Educational objective# All prokaryotic DNA polymerases (I, II, and III) remove mismatched nucleotides via their 3′ to 5′ exonuclease (proofreading) activity.  Only DNA polymerase I has 5′ to 3′ exonuclease activity, which is used to remove the RNA primer synthesized by RNA primase.  ",

They protect chromosomes from being recognized as damaged DNA, help to regulate gene expression, and participate in controlling cell replication and entry into senescence.  As DNA polymerase cannot fully replicate the 3' end of the lagging chromosomal strands, cell division and aging lead to progressive DNA loss and telomere shortening at chromosomal ends.  Once cells reach their maximum limit for proliferation (~50-70 divisions), the shortened telomeres trigger permanent growth arrest.  Cell checkpoint genes (eg, TP53) become activated, and the critically short and dysfunctional telomeres lead to programmed cell death (apoptosis). $#Telomerase# is an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase that consists of 2 molecules, human telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and telomerase RNA (TR or TERC).  Telomerase synthesizes #telomeric DNA sequences# that can replace the lost #chromosomal ends# of the telomeres.  As a result, the telomere can divide without reaching a limit.  Normal human cells have absent telomerase activity except in cells that need to divide regularly (eg, germ cells, certain adult stem cells).  However, >90% of cancer cells contain increased telomerase activity, allowing for continued proliferation without apoptosis. $#(Choice A)#  Matrix metalloproteinases are proteases that degrade extracellular matrix proteins.

This process converts the inactive X chromosome into condensed heterochromatin at the periphery of the nucleus (#Barr body#).  Heterochromatin consists of heavily methylated DNA bases (eg, cytosine converted to methylcytosine) and deacetylated histones, which cause it to have a #low level of transcriptional activity#. $#X-inactivation# (ie, lyonization) is maintained across cell division (ie, all of a cell's descendants have the same X chromosome inactivated), resulting in clusters of cells throughout the body that express either the maternal or paternal X chromosome.

These findings suggest #genetic anticipation#, in which an inherited condition #presents earlier# and with #more severe# disease in #successive generations#. $The most likely diagnosis in this case is #myotonic dystrophy# (DM), an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion: $• #Classic# (adult) DM:  Muscle weakness affecting the #distal extremities and face# (eg, absent facial expression, long and narrow face) is classic, as seen in this patient's mother.  #Myotonia# (impaired muscle relaxation) also occurs and is often described by patients as cramping or stiffness. $With #increasing repeat expansion# length, DM can cause worsening symptoms in successive generations, as seen in this infant. $• #Congenital# DM:  Neonates have respiratory distress and poor feeding due to #profound muscle weakness# and hypotonia.  Prenatal findings of DM may include polyhydramnios secondary to impaired swallowing from weakened pharyngeal muscles.  Decreased fetal movement can also result in flexion contractures (ie, arthrogryposis) and clubfoot. $#(Choice B)#  Genetic heterogeneity describes different genetic mutations causing the same disease (eg, tuberous sclerosis).  This mechanism is inconsistent with this patient's symptoms because affected members of the same family would have the same mutation.  Moreover, this mother and child have markedly different disease manifestations. $#(Choice C)#  @Germline mosaicism@ occurs when an unaffected parent has gametes with a mutated allele that is passed to offspring; it is typically suspected when multiple siblings have an autosomal dominant disorder with phenotypically normal parents. $#(Choice D)#  Prader-Willi syndrome often occurs due to @maternal imprinting@, in which a loss-of-function mutation in the paternal allele is inherited while the maternally inherited allele is silenced.  Infants can have profound disease (eg, hypotonia, feeding difficulties), but the mother would not be affected. $#(Choice E)#  Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) refers to a variation at a single base pair within a DNA sequence.  SNPs occur frequently throughout the genome and contribute to genetic variation within the population.  If located near or within a gene, they may be markers of certain genetic diseases but would not cause the increasingly severe manifestations seen in this family's successive generations. $#Educational objective# Anticipation describes an inherited condition that presents earlier and with more severe disease in successive generations.  In myotonic dystrophy, increasing length of the pathogenic trinucleotide repeat expansion accounts for severe hypotonia in a neonate (congenital) and mild symptoms (eg, myotonia, facial weakness) in a parent (classic [adult]).

One end of the molecule serves as the amino acid binding site; the opposite end contains a specific nucleic acid sequence known as the #anticodon# that is #complementary# to one or more #mRNA codons# (due to base wobbling).

HD is caused by an expansion of cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) trinucleotide repeats.  Most patients develop symptoms in their 40s or 50s, but an earlier age of onset and more severe symptoms are associated with a larger number of #trinucleotide repeats#. $During spermatogenesis, CAG repeats in the abnormal HTT gene (chromosome 4p) can rapidly increase (much more than during oogenesis).  Therefore, patients who receive an abnormal gene from their fathers tend to develop the disease earlier in life.  The tendency for clinical symptoms to worsen and/or occur earlier in subsequent generations is called #anticipation#.  Anticipation is common in disorders associated with trinucleotide repeats, as in Fragile X syndrome, myotonic dystrophy, and Friedreich ataxia. $#(Choice B)#  Genomic imprinting is a selective inactivation of the genes of either maternal or paternal origin.  It results in Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes, which involve deletions of the same region on chromosome (15q) but have very different clinical manifestations due to the differential expression of parental genes.  When the chromosome with the deleted region comes from the father, the lack of expression of maternally imprinted genes results in Prader-Willi syndrome.  Likewise, deletions affecting the maternal chromosome result in Angelman syndrome due to absent expression of paternally imprinted genes. $#(Choice C)#  HD is transmitted in an autosomal dominant pattern with complete penetrance, which means that a child who inherits the abnormal gene will inevitably develop Huntington disease. $#(Choice D)#  Microdeletion is the loss of genetic material too small to be visible via light microscopy.  For example, microdeletion of 22q11 is responsible for DiGeorge syndrome. $#(Choice E)#  The presence of 2 populations of cells with different genotypes in one patient resulting in the mixed expression of disease is called mosaicism.  Examples of mosaicism include milder forms of Turner (genotype 46XX/45X0), Klinefelter (46XY/47XXY), and Down syndromes. $#(Choice F)#  Sometimes, one gene mutation leads to multiple, seemingly unrelated phenotypic abnormalities, a genetic phenomenon termed pleiotropy. $#Educational objective# An increased number of trinucleotide repeats on the HTT gene is associated with Huntington disease.  The larger the number of repeats, the earlier the onset of the disease.  Trinucleotide expansion occurs more frequently during paternal transmission, causing a genetic phenomenon called anticipation.  "

  "explanation_2": "$Transfer RNA (tRNA) is a form of non-coding RNA composed of 74-93 nucleotides.  Specific tRNAs transfer certain amino acid residues to the growing polypeptide during translation.  tRNA functions by recognizing the 3 base codon on the mRNA being translated through its anticodon region, which contains complementary bases.  The secondary structure of tRNA resembles a cloverleaf and contains the following regions: $• The #acceptor stem# is created through the base pairing of the 5'-terminal nucleotides with the 3'-terminal nucleotides.  The CCA tail hangs off the 3' end, with the amino acid bound to the 3' terminal hydroxyl group.  tRNA is \"loaded\" with the appropriate amino acid by aminoacyl tRNA synthetase.  The acceptor stem helps mediate correct tRNA recognition by the proper aminoacyl tRNA synthetase. $•  A #3' CCA tail# is added to the 3' end of tRNA as a posttranscriptional modification in eukaryotes and most prokaryotes.  Several enzymes utilize this tail to help recognize tRNA molecules. $• The #D loop# contains numerous dihydrouridine residues, which are modified bases often present in tRNA.  The D loop (along with the acceptor stem and anticodon loop) facilitates correct tRNA recognition by the proper aminoacyl tRNA synthetase. $• The #anticodon loop# contains sequences that are complementary to the mRNA codon.  During translation, the ribosome complex selects the proper tRNA based solely on its anticodon sequence. $• The #T loop# contains the TΨC sequence that is necessary for binding of tRNA to ribosomes.  The TΨC sequence refers to the presence of ribothymidine, pseudouridine, and cytidine residues. $#(Choices A and F)#  AUG and UAG are mRNA start and stop codons that initiate and terminate translation, respectively. $#(Choices C and D)#  After transcription, eukaryotic pre-mRNA undergoes posttranscriptional modification, which includes the addition of a poly-A tail at the 3' end and methylguanosine cap at the 5' end, and the removal of introns. $#(Choice E)#  A TATA box is an upstream promoter region associated with some genes in eukaryotic organisms.  TATA binding protein binds to this promoter during transcription, unwinding the DNA and initiating separation of the strands. $#Educational objective# Transfer RNA (tRNA)  is a small, noncoding form of RNA that contains chemically modified bases (eg, dihydrouridine, ribothymidine, pseudouridine).  tRNA has a CCA sequence at its 3'-end that is used as a recognition sequence by proteins.

DNA bending allows activator proteins to interact with general transcription factors and RNA polymerase II at the promoter, increasing the #rate of transcription (choice D).#  Enhancers can be located #upstream or downstream# from the gene being transcribed and may be near the gene or thousands of base pairs away #(choice B).#  They have also been identified both #within introns# of the gene being transcribed as well as on separate chromosomes.  Silencers are similar to enhancers, but they decrease transcription rates by binding repressor proteins. $#Educational objective# Enhancers and silencers may be located upstream, downstream, or within a transcribed gene; these gene sequences function to increase and decrease the rate of transcription, respectively.  In contrast, promoter regions are typically located 25 or 75 bases upstream from their associated genes and function to initiate transcription.  ",

  "explanation_2": "$The experiment described above is known as the Northern Blot technique, a procedure used to detect specific mRNA sequences in a sample to assess for gene expression.  In this experiment, the Northern Blot identifies three different mRNA transcripts containing exon 4, with varying patterns of expression in the different tissues.  This is consistent with alternative splicing, a process whereby the exons of the pre-mRNA produced by transcription of a gene are reconnected in multiple ways during post-transcriptional processing.  The resulting finalized mRNAs are then translated into different protein isoforms.  Thus, a single gene can code for multiple proteins when the same gene is spliced differently in different tissues. $Alternative splicing is a normal phenomenon in eukaryotes that greatly increases the biodiversity of proteins that can be encoded by the genome.  It is thought that at least 70% of the 30,000 genes in the human genome undergo alternative splicing, and that on average, a given gene produces 4 alternatively spliced variants.  Thus, the human genome is able to encode a total of 80,000 to 100,000 proteins which differ in their sequence and function. $Abnormal variations in splicing are implicated in many diseases (e.g., beta-thalassemia, cancer).  Alternative splicing also plays a prominent role in the lifecycle of many retroviruses.  For instance, HIV produces a single primary RNA transcript that is alternatively spliced to produce over 40 different mRNAs. $#(Choice B)#  DNA (gene) rearrangement occurs during the development and maturation of B cells and T cells.  VDJ (#V#ariable, #D#iverse, and #J#oining) gene recombination is a random process that takes place in the primary lymphoid tissue (the bone marrow for B cells, and Thymus for T cells). $#(Choice C)#  A mutation is a change in the DNA sequence of a gene.  While somatic mutations do sporadically occur throughout the body, they do so only in a minority of cells.  The vast majority of DNA throughout the body’s tissues consists of identical gene coding sequences. $#(Choice D & E)#  Transcription factors influence RNA polymerase’s affinity for specific genes by binding to DNA promoter sequences or enhancer regions, which can either stimulate or inhibit gene transcription.  Transcription factors and enhancer regions affect the expression of pre-mRNA, but they do not influence post-transcriptional processing. $#Educational objective# Alternative splicing is a process where the exons of a gene are reconnected in multiple ways during post-transcriptional processing.  This creates different mRNA sequences and subsequently, different protein isoforms.

Telomerase is composed of 2 main subunits, the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) subunit and the telomerase RNA component (TERC).

Although this is partially mediated by inactivating genetic mutations in tumor suppressor genes (eg, p53), much of oncogenesis is mediated by the altered expression of unmutated genes, as follows: $• #Histone modification:#  Chromatin is organized into @nucleosomes@, which consist of a segment of DNA wrapped around 8 histone proteins.  Modification of histones via acetylation, phosphorylation, or methylation can alter the availability of DNA for transcription, leading to increased or decreased gene expression.  Histone modification allows tumors to increase prosurvival gene expression and reduce cell cycle arrest/apoptosis gene expression. $• #Transcription factor expression:#  Transcription factors are activated by cell-surface ligand binding or by phosphorylation.  Activated transcription factors travel to the nucleus and bind to the promoter/enhancer region of a specific gene, which alters RNA polymerase binding and subsequent gene expression.  Tumors overexpress surface receptors (eg, HER2) that generate pro-survival transcription factors and underexpress surface receptors that generate cell cycle arrest/apoptotic signals. $• #CpG modifications:#  Promoter regions typically contain a section of 200-2000 base pairs that primarily contain a cytosine followed a guanosine.  #Methylation# of the CpG region #silences# the adjacent gene; neoplasms often methylate CpG promoter regions adjacent to genes that slow growth. $As part of oncogenesis, many #glioblastomas methylate# the CpG region adjacent to the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase #(MGMT) gene#, which generates a protein that #repairs damaged DNA# (eg, converts O6-methylguanine [a naturally occurring alkylation product] back to guanine).

  "explanation_2": "$The numerous fleshy, dome-shaped, and pedunculated lesions are cutaneous neurofibromas, a hallmark of #neurofibromatosis type 1# (NF1).  This condition is caused by mutations in the NF1 gene, which is located on chromosome 17 and has an #autosomal dominant# pattern of inheritance #(choices C, E, and F)#.  Because the NF1 gene product (neurofibromin) functions as a tumor suppressor protein, loss of expression leads to uncontrolled cellular proliferation that affects multiple systems. $NF1 has complete penetrance—all patients who inherit the gene develop some phenotypic traits—but individual expression is highly variable.  The following @findings@ are most common, some or all of which may be present in an individual with NF1: $• Neurofibromas:  #Neurofibromas# are benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors that most commonly affect the skin and are typically multiple in number. $• Skin:  #Café au lait spots# are flat, hyperpigmented macules or patches with distinct margins that usually appear within the first year after birth.  Skinfold freckling in the axillary or inguinal regions is a highly characteristic cutaneous feature of NF1. $• Eyes:  #Lisch nodules# are raised, pigmented, hamartomas of the iris that do not affect vision.  Optic pathway gliomas may occur and cause visual loss. $#Other tumors#, both benign and malignant, also develop at increased frequency in patients with NF1.  CNS tumors (eg, astrocytoma, brainstem glioma) may cause increased intracranial pressure and/or #focal neurologic deficits#, which might explain this patient's headaches and left leg weakness.  Patients may also have bony abnormalities (eg, pseudoarthrosis, scoliosis) and/or neurologic disorders (eg, learning disabilities, seizures). $#(Choice A)#  With genomic imprinting, only one parental gene is expressed while the other is inactivated by epigenetic modification (eg, methylation of DNA in the sperm or ova).  A classic example is @Prader-Willi syndrome@ in which gene deletions on paternal chromosome 15 result in phenotypic abnormalities (eg, hyperphagia, obesity) despite a normal maternally inherited gene. $#(Choice B)#  Mitochondrial inheritance is exclusively maternal and includes several rare neuromuscular disorders typically characterized by muscle weakness, hypotonia, and/or encephalopathy. $#Educational objective# Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a single-gene autosomal dominant disorder that occurs due to mutation of the NF1 gene located on chromosome 17.  Cutaneous neurofibromas, café au lait spots, skinfold freckling, and Lisch nodules are the most common manifestations.  ",

  "explanation_2": "$This patient with developmental delay and a trinucleotide expansion on chromosome X has #fragile X syndrome# (FXS), one of the most common causes of #intellectual disability#.  FXS is caused by a mutation of the fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1) gene on the long arm of the X chromosome. $FMR1 normally has 6 to 50 CGG trinucleotide repeats in the 5′ untranslated region that can potentially expand during meiosis in oocytes.  Expansion over generations can lead to #>200 CGG trinucleotide repeats# (ie, full mutation), which causes #FMR1 hypermethylation#.  DNA methylation in the promoter region of FMR1 prevents transcription of the gene and subsequent production of fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein (FMRP). $Because FMRP is involved in development and plasticity of neurons, silencing of the gene in FXS results in impaired neural development.  Early findings include #developmental delay# and #neurobehavioral# features (eg, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder), as seen in this patient with speech delay and poor social skills.  @Physical findings@ of FXS are subtle until puberty, at which time macroorchidism and dysmorphic facies (eg, long, narrow face; prominent forehead and chin) become more noticeable. $#(Choice A)#  Imprinting refers to physiologic gene expression from only 1 parental allele rather than from both.  Disease occurs when there is a deletion of the allele that is normally expressed, as in Prader-Willi syndrome (paternally inherited deletion of part of chromosome 15).  The severity of FXS depends on the number of trinucleotide repeats or sex of the patient (ie, boys have more severe presentations), not the parental origin of the mutation. $#(Choice B)#  Defects in DNA mismatch repair genes cause Lynch syndrome, a condition with an increased risk of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer and extraintestinal malignancies.  Although mismatch repair may have a role in expanding trinucleotide repeats over successive generations, clinical features of FXS do not occur without hypermethylation-induced silencing of FMR1. $#(Choices C and D)#  @Exons@ (#ex#pressed cod#ons#) are protein coding regions of DNA.  Introns are removed during intranuclear mRNA processing and not expressed in the final mRNA sequence.  Abnormalities in exon deletion or intron splicing generally result in a nonfunctional protein, whereas in FXS gene hypermethylation prevents transcription and translation. $#Educational objective# Fragile X syndrome is caused by increased CGG trinucleotide repeats within the fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1) gene on the long arm of the X chromosome.

Many patients with trisomy 21 develop #early-onset Alzheimer disease (AD)#, defined as diagnosis of AD age ≤65, with some developing AD as early as the fourth decade of life. $Characteristic pathologic changes associated with AD involve accumulation of intracellular @neurofibrillary tangles@ and extracellular @amyloid-beta plaques@: $• Neurofibrillary tangles are composed of tau protein, a primary component of intracellular microtubules. In AD, tau protein is hyperphosphorylated, causing microtubule structures to collapse into \"tangles\" that contribute to global neuronal dysfunction. $• Amyloid beta is an abnormal fragment of #amyloid precursor protein#, which is normally involved in synaptic formation and repair.

This substitution causes a @missense mutation@, or a codon change that results in the production of a different amino acid during protein translation.  In SCD, the mutation results in a glutamic acid (ie, #glutamate#) #to valine substitution#. $A genetic code table can be used to identify which DNA or RNA codons encode their respective amino acids, as well as base changes that can result in a substitution: $• Glutamate is encoded for by 2 unique combinations: #GAA and GAG#. $• Valine is encoded for by 4 unique combinations: GTT, GTC, #GTA, and GTG#.

These mutations are unrelated to SCD. $#(Choice C)#  A single nucleotide substitution from GAA to GUA in RNA results in glutamate being replaced by valine in the beta-globin protein.  However, because the pyrimidine base uracil does not occur in DNA, this nucleotide sequence would not be present in the beta-globin gene itself. $#(Choice F)#  This single nucleotide substitution demonstrates a silent mutation because both TTA and CTA code for leucine. $#Educational objective# Sickle cell disease is the result of a missense mutation in which valine replaces glutamate in the hemoglobin beta-globin chain.

  "explanation_2": "The most common germline mutation in breast and #ovarian cancer# is a defect in a #BRCA# #gene#.  BRCA1 and BRCA2 produce tumor suppression proteins involved in repair of #double-stranded DNA breaks# via homologous recombination repair.  Loss of function in a pair of BRCA alleles leads to the accumulation of unrepaired genomic mutations, which dramatically increases the risk of oncogenesis.  Although BRCA defects are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, cancer occurs only after a somatic mutation strikes the complementary BRCA allele. $Cancers with BRCA mutations are often treated with platinum compounds (eg, #carboplatin#, cisplatin).  These drugs covalently attach an alkyl group to purine base pairs, which results in #cross-linking# within and between DNA strands.  Repair of DNA cross-links typically involves inducing double-stranded DNA breaks, therefore, proteins encoded by BRCA genes are also important for cross-link repair.  Tumor cells with BRCA mutations are more likely to accumulate excessive DNA cross-links and undergo apoptosis when exposed to platinum compounds, resulting in greater #tumor regression# compared to patients with intact BRCA genes. $In contrast, paclitaxel therapy targets the cytoskeletal protein tubulin, which contributes to mitotic spindle formation, chromosome segregation, and cell division.  Because BRCA mutations do not significantly impact the cytoskeleton, patients with and without BRCA mutations typically have a similar response to paclitaxel treatment. $#(Choice A)#  DNA methylation helps regulate gene transcription.  Many cancers increase methylation of the promoter region of tumor suppressor genes, which reduces their transcription.  Although some chemotherapy agents (eg, decitabine, 5-azacytidine) can alter DNA methylation, this is not the mechanism of carboplatin or paclitaxel. $#(Choice B)#  The constitutive activation of growth factor genes often contributes to the unchecked growth of cancer cells.  Therefore, growth factor inhibitors (eg, erlotinib, afatinib) are used to treat many cancer types (eg, lung, colon).  Carboplatin and paclitaxel do not work by this mechanism. $#(Choices D and E)#  Cancerous cells often develop mutations in genes that control the cell cycle (eg, CDKs, RB) or cell death (eg, BCL-2, p53).  Although medications (eg, venetoclax) have been developed to counter the products of these mutations, neither carboplatin nor paclitaxel focuses primarily on the cell cycle. $#Educational objective# Germline mutations in the BRCA gene dramatically increase the risk for breast and ovarian cancer due to an inability to repair double-stranded DNA breaks.  Cancers with BRCA gene mutations are often particularly susceptible to treatment with platinum compounds (eg, carboplatin), which cause DNA cross-linking requiring repair by BRCA-encoded machinery.

With sufficient estrogen and progestin supplementation, however, these women can develop a thick endometrial lining that is substantial enough to support a pregnancy.  In vitro fertilization of Turner syndrome patients with an ovum provided by a related or anonymous donor results in pregnancy rates approaching 60%.  A thorough renal, cardiac and thyroid examination should be carried out before pregnancy is attempted to reduce the potential for complications during pregnancy.  Pregnancy can occur spontaneously in some patients with Turner syndrome, but the risk of spontaneous abortion, Down syndrome and Turner syndrome are all increased in such cases. $ #(Choice A)# Bromocriptine is a dopamine receptor agonist that inhibits pituitary prolactin secretion.  It can restore fertility in women with hyperprolactinemia. $ #(Choice B)# Clomiphene citrate is an antiestrogen that stimulates ovulation by blocking the feedback inhibition of estrogen on the hypothalamus thereby enhancing the release of pituitary gonadotropins.  It is best used to achieve fertility in women with ovulatory failure who are normogonadotropic, normoprolactinemic and euthyroid. $ #(Choice C)# Pulsatile GnRH infusion can stimulate ovulation in women who have disordered hypothalamic GnRH secretion resulting in hypogonadotropic, hypogonadal anovulation.  Pituitary and ovarian function must be intact for this method to work. $ #(Choice D)# hCG therapy can be used to trigger the ovulatory cascade in an oocyte donor when her follicles are deemed mature. $ #Educational objective# In vitro fertilization using a donated ovum is the most promising means of achieving pregnancy in a woman with Turner syndrome.  Pregnancy can occasionally occur spontaneously in some patients with Turner syndrome, but the risk of spontaneous abortion, Down syndrome and Turner syndrome are all increased in such cases. "

TS is due to loss of an X chromosome @(45,X)@ and is the most common cause of ovarian dysgenesis. $During early gestation, ovarian development is initially normal in TS.  However, germ cells subsequently undergo accelerated apoptosis, and ovarian follicles are replaced by connective tissue (ie, #streak ovaries#), resulting in #primary ovarian insufficiency#.  At puberty, girls with TS may develop pubic hair (due to normal adrenal androgen production) but typically have absent breast development and primary amenorrhea due to lack of ovarian estrogen production.  Growth and maturation of the uterus are also estrogen dependent, as seen in this girl with a small and underdeveloped uterus; most patients are infertile. $Extragonadal manifestations of TS include but are not limited to: $• Physical features:  Short stature, broad chest, and webbed neck are characteristic. $• Cardiac anomalies:  Bicuspid aortic valve and aortic coarctation are the most common, and patients are at increased risk for #aortic dissection# at a young age, as seen here. $• Renal anomalies:  These occur in almost half of patients and include collecting system malformations (eg, ureter duplication) and #horseshoe kidney# (fusion of the lower renal poles).

This constellation of findings is characteristic of @Turner syndrome@ (TS), a sex chromosome disorder due to #loss of an X chromosome#.  Because the X chromosome contains a short stature homeobox (SHOX) gene, which normally promotes long bone growth, patients often present with declining linear velocity, as seen in this girl. $Aneuploidy (abnormal chromosome number), as in TS, is most often caused by #meiotic nondisjunction# during gametogenesis.  Meiotic nondisjunction refers to failed separation of homologous chromosomes (meiosis I) or sister chromatids (meiosis II), which results in a gamete with an abnormal number of chromosomes (eg, 22, 24).  When a gamete lacking an X chromosome is fertilized with a gamete containing a normal number of chromosomes, the embryo has a 45,X genotype. $Alternately, absence of an X chromosome may be due to mitotic nondisjunction after fertilization.  This results in somatic mosaicism, in which the X chromosome is missing in only some cells (45,X/46,XX), and a milder TS phenotype. $#(Choice A)#  Balanced translocations are clinically silent because genetic material is exchanged between nonhomologous chromosomes but not lost.  Affected individuals can have offspring with unbalanced translocations (eg, @trisomy 21@).  However, autosomal translocation would not cause Turner's syndrome. $#(Choice B)#  Frameshift mutation occurs when a number of nucleotides not evenly divisible by 3 are inserted into or deleted from a sequence of coding DNA.  The reading frame is shifted during translation, creating a different peptide sequence. $#(Choice D)#  Skewed X-chromosome inactivation occurs when one X chromosome is inactivated more often than would occur by chance alone.  However, because many of the genes that contribute to TS (eg, SHOX) normally escape X inactivation, findings of TS are not typical with this mechanism. $#(Choice E)#  Uniparental disomy occurs when both copies of a chromosome are inherited from 1 parent.  Disease occurs when the inherited chromosomes contain genes that are physiologically imprinted (silenced), and gene expression normally relies on the other parent's genes (which are absent), as in Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome. $#Educational objective# Turner syndrome is characterized by loss of an X chromosome, most often due to meiotic nondisjunction during gametogenesis.

A large percentage of these patients likely have a familial (inherited) cause.  #Familial DCM# can result from a variety of genetic mutations affecting either sarcomere (ie, the contractile apparatus) or nonsarcomere proteins.  Truncating mutations (usually nonsense mutations) affecting the #TTN gene#, which encodes for the sarcomere protein #titin#, are the most common cause of familial DCM.  Titin is an elastic protein that anchors the beta-myosin heavy chain to the Z-discs and likely contributes to passive myocardial tension; absence of the full titin protein leads to myocardial dysfunction. $TTN gene mutations follow #autosomal dominant# inheritance; however, they have incomplete penetrance, leading to delayed or absent clinical manifestations in some family members. $#(Choice A)#  Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy is characterized by fibrosis and scarring of right ventricular myocardium, which predisposes to ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.  Familial disease most commonly results from impaired desmosome function due to mutations in genes encoding desmosomal proteins (eg, plakoglobin, desmoplakin). $#(Choice B)#  Familial bicuspid aortic valve disease has been associated with a mutation affecting the NOTCH1 gene that encodes transcription regulatory proteins. $#(Choice D)#  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a common cause of sudden cardiac death in young patients.  It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and most commonly involves mutations in the genes encoding beta-myosin heavy chain or myosin-binding protein C. $#(Choice E)#  Restrictive cardiomyopathy most commonly results from infiltrative disease (eg, amyloidosis, hemochromatosis, sarcoidosis); however, familial disease does occur.  Familial restrictive cardiomyopathy typically involves mutations in genes encoding one of several sarcomere or cytoskeletal proteins, but mutations of the TTN gene are not a well-established cause. $#Educational objective# Autosomal dominant mutations in the TTN gene, which encodes for the sarcomere protein titin, are the most common cause of familial dilated cardiomyopathy.

Many patients with HCM are asymptomatic and are recognized when an abnormal murmur or ECG is noted during evaluation for other purposes.  HCM typically involves left ventricular (LV) enlargement that is most prominent in the basal anterior septum and can lead to #LV outflow tract obstruction#.  The clinical manifestations, which depend on the extent of hypertrophy and outflow tract obstruction, include: $• exertional dyspnea, chest pain, fatigue, palpitations, presyncope, or syncope.  Sudden cardiac arrest can also occur. $• a harsh crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur best heard at the apex and left sternal border, with characteristic changes in intensity during @physiologic maneuvers@. $The condition is inherited in #autosomal dominant# fashion, resulting from mutations in genes encoding for myocardial contractile proteins of the sarcomere.  The proteins #cardiac myosin binding protein C# and #cardiac beta-myosin heavy chain# are most commonly affected.  The phenotypic manifestations of the disease (eg, septal enlargement) typically begin to develop around the time of adolescence. $Despite the autosomal dominant inheritance, affected patients may not always have an identifiable first-degree relative who is similarly affected because not all mutations responsible for HCM have been identified and many known mutations have variable penetrance. $#Educational objective# Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by mutation in one of several genes encoding the myocardial contractile proteins of the cardiac sarcomere.

  "explanation_2": "$During normal meiosis, homologous chromosomes separate to pass on individual chromatids to daughter cells.  In #meiotic nondisjunction#, the chromosomes fail to separate, allowing one or more daughter cells to pass on with an #extra copy# of a chromosome.  Increasing maternal age, particularly #age >35#, is associated with an elevated risk of nondisjunction that is likely due to cumulative oxidative stress, depletion of available mature oocytes, and shortening of oocyte telomeres.  From highest to lowest prevalence, the most common consequences of maternal nondisjunction are #trisomies 21# (Down syndrome), 18 (Edwards syndrome), and 13 (Patau syndrome). $Less than 5% of Down syndrome cases are caused by a @Robertsonian translocation@ #(choice B),# which results from a break near the centromeres of 2 chromosomes (eg, chromosomes 14 and 21) and subsequent transfer of genetic material between these chromosomes.  This translocation results in 46 chromosomes in the fetus with 3 effective copies of chromosome 21. $Classic features of @Down syndrome@ include a flat facial profile, epicanthal folds, upslanting palpebral fissures, protruding tongue, and small ears.  Congenital heart defects (eg, complete atrioventricular defect, ventricular or atrial septal defect) are seen in 50% of patients. $#(Choice A)#  Chromosomal deletions are associated with cri-du-chat syndrome (5p deletion), DiGeorge syndrome (22q11 microdeletion), and Prader-Willi syndrome (15q deletion).

When a selectively expressed allele is abnormal (eg, gene deletion), conditions such as Prader-Willi syndrome (maternal inactivation/paternal deletion) or Angelman syndrome (paternal inactivation/maternal deletion) can result. $#(Choice E)#  Trinucleotide repeat expansions within DNA can dysregulate protein production, causing disorders such as Huntington disease, myotonic dystrophy, and fragile X syndrome. $#Educational objective# Down syndrome is most commonly caused by maternal meiotic nondisjunction, a process by which the fetus receives 3 full copies of chromosome 21.

Now called #primary oocytes#, these cells arrest in #prophase of meiosis I# #(choice C)# and remain there until ovulation.  The chromosome pairs are arranged in a tetrad during this phase, and their proximity allows for genetic recombination.

One common option for screening during the second trimester is the #quadruple screen# at 15-19 weeks gestation.  #Low maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and unconjugated estriol# levels are associated with DS and correlate with decreased fetal levels (possibly due to suboptimal fetal tissue function).

  "explanation_2": "$To be affected by an @autosomal recessive@ disorder, an offspring must inherit 2 copies of the mutant allele (a), a copy from the mother and another copy from the father (in this case, the sperm donor). $In this example, genetic analysis confirms that the #mother is a carrier# (Aa), which gives her a #50%# chance of passing 1 mutant allele (a) to her child. $The #sperm donor# does not have Pompe disease, but his #carrier status is unknown# (ie, he has either an AA or Aa genotype).  Given that he has no family history of the disease, his risk of being a carrier is the same as that of the general population.  #Hardy-Weinberg analysis# can be used to estimate the frequency of alleles and genotypes in the general population: $• The total gene pool is given by (p + q) = 1.  By convention, p = normal allele (A) frequency and #q = mutant allele (a) frequency# in the population of interest. $• Disease frequency is equivalent to the proportion of homozygous recessive individuals.  These affected individuals have 2 copies of the mutant allele (aa); therefore, the frequency of affected individuals = q × q = q2. $• #Carrier frequency# is equal to the proportion of heterozygous individuals.  Carriers have only 1 mutant allele that may be inherited in 2 different ways (ie, Aa or aA); consequently, the probability of being a carrier = 2pq.  For rare autosomal recessive disorders, p ≈ 1; therefore, the probability approximates to 2 times the frequency of the mutant allele, or #2q#. $In this case, 1 in 40,000 individuals is affected by the condition in the general population, so q2 = 1/40,000 and q = 1/√40,000 = 1/200.  Thus, the probability of the #sperm donor# being a carrier = 2q = 2 ×(1/200) = #1/100#.  Given that a carrier sperm donor would have a #50%# chance of passing on the mutant allele (a), the probability of the child being affected is: $P (mother gives recessive allele) × P (donor is a carrier) × P (donor gives recessive allele) = (1/2 × 1/100 ×1/2) = #1/400# $#(Choices E and F)#  1/40,000 represents the disease frequency (q2), not the mutant allele frequency (q). $#Educational objective# The Hardy-Weinberg equation can be used to estimate carrier frequency, disease frequency, and frequency of different genotypes if at least 1 of these values is known.

Patients with CF have variable severity of lung and pancreatic function.  Although most patients have recurrent sinopulmonary infections and pancreatic insufficiency, some patients may have mild disease depending on their underlying mutation.  Regardless of lung or pancreas function, virtually all adult men with CF have #azoospermia# and #infertility#.  Although spermatogenesis is usually normal, almost all males with CF are unable to secrete semen due to #congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD)#.  #CFTR mutations# are likely responsible for abnormal development of Wolffian structures, resulting in vasal agenesis and defective sperm transport. $A diagnosis of CF can be based on #elevated sweat chloride levels#.  If the sweat chloride test is equivocal, measurement of #nasal transepithelial potential difference# and genetic testing for CFTR mutations should be performed to confirm the diagnosis. $#(Choice B)#  Although, primary ciliary dyskinesia (eg, Kartagener syndrome) can cause recurrent pulmonary infections and digital clubbing, infertility in Kartagener syndrome is usually due to immotile spermatozoa.  Abnormal nasociliary motility is a nonspecific finding that is seen most commonly in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia and in some patients with CF (due to abnormally thick mucus).  A more specific test for CF is the nasal transepithelial potential difference.  In addition, CBAVD is virtually pathognomonic for a CFTR mutation. $#(Choice C)#  Low serum alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is associated with AAT deficiency and not with CF.  AAT deficiency is typically associated with panacinar emphysema and chronic liver disease.  Infertility is not seen in these patients. $#(Choices D and F)#  FSH, LH, and testosterone levels are usually normal in patients with CF.  A low testosterone level in the setting of decreased FSH and LH is seen in hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (eg, Kallmann syndrome). $#(Choice E)#  Primary humoral deficiencies usually manifest as recurrent upper and lower respiratory tract infections due to impaired antibody production.  However, most patients with selective IgA deficiency are asymptomatic. $#Educational objective# CFTR gene mutations are the most common cause of congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD).

The pathogenesis usually involves @meiotic nondisjunction@, in which improper separation of homologous chromosomes (ie, sister chromatids) results in gametes with an abnormal chromosome number (ie, aneuploidy).  Patients with Klinefelter syndrome have nondisjunction of the #X chromosome#, typically resulting in a @47,XXY karyotype@. $Klinefelter syndrome is often diagnosed during puberty when the following characteristic findings develop: $• #Primary hypogonadism# (low testosterone, high gonadotropins [LH, FSH]):  Hypogonadism occurs due to primary testicular failure from hyalinization and fibrosis of the seminiferous tubules.  This results in #small, firm testes# and azoospermia (infertility).  Leydig cell dysfunction also occurs and leads to testosterone deficiency, causing sparse or absent facial and body hair, decreased muscle mass, and #gynecomastia#. $• #Tall stature#:  Because estrogen (derived from testosterone) is responsible for growth plate closure, tall stature is likely in part due to low testosterone levels in Klinefelter syndrome.  Patients also have an additional SHOX (short stature homeobox) gene, which likely contributes to tall stature because it is found on chromosomes X and Y and is essential for linear growth. $• #Learning disabilities# and behavioral abnormalities (eg, lack of insight, poor judgment):  Mild intellectual disability is seen in some patients, although most have normal intelligence. $#(Choice A)#  FBN1 mutation on chromosome 15 causes a defect in the extracellular matrix protein fibrillin and is responsible for @Marfan syndrome@.

Hypogonadism and intellectual disability can occur, but short stature and obesity are characteristic features not seen in this patient. $#(Choice D)#  Meiotic nondisjunction of chromosome Y results in XYY syndrome (47,XYY).  Patients have tall stature and learning disabilities, but hypogonadism does not occur. $#(Choice E)#  @Fragile X syndrome@ is caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion (CGG) in the FMR1 gene and is characterized by macroorchidism (not Tanner stage 1 testes), a long face, large ears, and intellectual disability. $#Educational objective# Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY) is the most common cause of male primary hypogonadism and is caused by meiotic nondisjunction of chromosome X.

In those with mitochondrial disorders, the degree of heteroplasmy varies randomly, leading to a #range of phenotypes#, even within the same family; the proportion of mutant to normal mitochondria correlates with symptom severity. $Due to the impairment in oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial defects tend to cause lactic acidosis and primarily affect tissues with the highest metabolic rates (eg, brain, muscle).  In this case, the family likely has MELAS, or #M#itochondrial #E#ncephalopathy, #L#actic #A#cidosis, and #S#troke-like episodes. $#(Choice A)#  Anticipation refers to the earlier onset and/or increased severity of an inherited disease over successive generations.  It often occurs in autosomal and X-linked trinucleotide repeat disorders, not mitochondrial disease, due to trinucleotide amplification during gametogenesis. $#(Choice C)#  Locus heterogeneity describes mutations that occur at different loci (ie, different genotypes) but cause similar phenotypes.  In contrast, family members affected by a mitochondrial disease likely have the same genotype but a variable phenotype due to heteroplasmy. $#(Choice D)#  Mosaicism refers to the presence of ≥2 cell lines, each with a unique nuclear genome, within an individual.  Although patients with germline mosaicism can have affected offspring, a maternal inheritance pattern would not be expected. $#(Choice E)#  Uniparental disomy occurs when both copies of a chromosome are inherited from one parent.  For chromosomes containing genes in which an allele derived from a specific parent is normally imprinted (silenced), inheritance of 2 copies of this chromosome can result in absent gene expression, as in Prader-Willi or Angelman syndrome. $#Educational objective# Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy is characterized by ragged red fibers on muscle biopsy and a maternal inheritance pattern.  Clinical presentation in affected family members varies due to the degree of heteroplasmy, or proportion of mitochondria with normal and mutant genomes in the same cell or tissue.  "

  "explanation_2": "#Congenital hypothyroidism# is one of the most common causes of preventable intellectual disability.  Most cases are due to thyroid dysgenesis (agenesis, hypoplasia, or ectopy), and iodine deficiency is a common cause in areas endemic for iodine deficiency (eg, Europe). $Neonates initially have no significant symptoms due to the presence of maternal thyroxine (T4) from transplacental transfer.  T4 is responsible for the stimulation of protein synthesis as well as carbohydrate and lipid catabolism in many cells; as maternal T4 wanes, metabolism is impaired and marked by a slowing of physical and mental activity (lethargy, poor feeding, constipation, hypotonia).  Accumulation of matrix substances cutaneously and internally results in nonpitting edema (eg, \"#puffy#\" face), @umbilical hernia@, protruding tongue, and a large anterior fontanelle.  In addition, T4 is essential for normal brain development and myelination during early life, and infants are at risk of severe and #irreversible intellectual disability#. $Treatment with #levothyroxine# by age 2 weeks can normalize cognitive and physical development. $Therefore, universal newborn screening for congenital hypothyroidism is performed in the United States but not in all other countries. $#(Choice A)#  Infants who are fed honey or exposed to spores from the soil are at risk for infantile botulism, which presents with constipation and flaccid paralysis.  A large anterior fontanelle, umbilical hernia, and macroglossia are not seen. $#(Choice B)#  Hypotonia and hypothyroidism are features of @Down syndrome@.  However, the absence of other dysmorphic features (eg, upslanting palpebral fissures, bilateral epicanthal folds, single palmar crease) makes Down syndrome unlikely in this patient. $#(Choice C)#  Galactosemia is caused by galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase deficiency.  Patients with this condition present with jaundice, vomiting, hepatomegaly, and lethargy after ingesting galactose in breast milk or formula in the first few days of life.  This patient was previously breastfeeding well and has no hepatomegaly. $#(Choice D)#  Hirschsprung disease is caused by abnormal migration of neural crest cells into the rectosigmoid colon.

This anomaly may occur in isolation but can be associated with @cleft lip@, which results from failed fusion of the maxillary prominences and the intermaxillary segment. $The pathophysiology of #isolated orofacial clefts# is usually #multifactorial# and related to #complex interactions# between genetic and environmental factors.  Failed fusion can result from a range of #gene variants# involved in cell differentiation, communication, and migration.  Specifically, genes encoding for proteins involved in extracellular matrix formation and adhesion have been implicated because normal palatal formation requires fusion of the mesenchyme beneath the epithelial layers of each palatine shelf.  In addition, certain #environmental factors# (eg, antiepileptic drugs, maternal smoking, folate deficiency) may increase the risk for cleft lip and/or palate, particularly in genetically susceptible individuals. $Some cases of orofacial clefts are related to genetic syndromes (eg, 22q11 deletion syndrome) with associated multisystem anomalies, but sporadic cases with no family history or identifiable risk factors also occur.  In the absence of an identifiable genetic syndrome, the risk of recurrence during subsequent pregnancies is <5%. $#(Choice A)#  @Autosomal recessive@ inheritance can be responsible for rare, syndromic causes of orofacial clefts.

However, there is no known association with orofacial clefts, especially in the absence of other abnormalities suggestive of an underlying genetic syndrome. $#(Choice C)#  Conditions of @mitochondrial inheritance@ (eg, mitochondrial myopathies, myoclonic epilepsy) are transferred by affected females to offspring.  Although this patient's maternal grandmother had a cleft palate, mitochondrial DNA does not contribute to the development of orofacial clefts. $#(Choice E)#  In females, a single X chromosome is randomly inactivated in each cell during early embryonic development.  @Skewed inactivation@ of the X chromosomes can result in female offspring developing symptoms of an X-linked recessive condition (eg, hemophilia).

In the case described above, Northern blot analysis of each of the cell culture samples can determine if mRNA corresponding to the gene of interest is being transcribed. $All of the \"blot\" tests rely on the same basic techniques.  First, the components of the unknown sample – DNA for Southern blots, mRNA for Northern blots, protein for Western blots, and DNA-bound protein for Southwestern blots – are separated by size and charge via gel electrophoresis.  The resultant bands are then blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with a labeled hybridization probe or antibody to identify the specific DNA fragment, mRNA molecule or protein of interest. $#(Choice B)#  A complete failure of gene expression would lead to a failure to produce the protein, which can be detected by @Western blotting@.
