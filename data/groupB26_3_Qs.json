Symptomatic congenital disease is often marked by intracranial calcification, hydrocephalus, chorioretinitis, jaundice, and/or thrombocytopenia.  Early treatment with #sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine# reduces neurologic and retinal sequelae. $Sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine work #synergistically# to #inhibit protozoal DNA synthesis# by blocking 2 steps necessary for the formation of tetrahydrofolate (THF), a cofactor needed for synthesis of #purine nucleic acids#.  Sulfadiazine inhibits #dihydropteroate synthase#, a microbial enzyme that generates dihydropteroate, which is converted to dihydrofolic acid.  Pyrimethamine inhibits #dihydrofolate reductase#, an enzyme that converts dihydrofolic acid to THF. $Sulfadiazine does not impair host DNA synthesis because dihydropteroate synthase is not found in human cells.  In contrast, pyrimethamine partially impairs host DNA synthesis because dihydrofolate reductase generates THF in host cells.  However, #leucovorin# (folinic acid), a derivative of THF that does not require conversion by dihydrofolate reductase, is usually administered with pyrimethamine to provide a bypass substrate for the generation of host purine nucleic acids. $#(Choice A)#  Patients are often treated with 2 different classes of antimicrobial medications to broaden the coverage of potential pathogens.  Sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine both block the same metabolic pathway, so the combination is less useful for empiric antimicrobial therapy. $#(Choice B)#  Gentamicin is often administered with an agent that targets the bacterial cell wall (eg, ampicillin, vancomycin) to allow gentamicin to enter the @intracellular space@.  Use of sulfadiazine with pyrimethamine does not alter intracellular penetration. $#(Choice C)#  Bacterial resistance can occur due to the production of an inactivating enzyme (eg, beta-lactamase).  Administration of an agent that inhibits the enzyme (eg, clavulanic acid) can often restore the effect of the antibiotic (eg, amoxicillin). $#(Choice D)#  Probenecid blocks the renal tubular excretion of most beta-lactam antibiotics, which can increase their serum level.  Sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine are not used together to alter renal excretion. $#Educational objective# Congenital toxoplasmosis is treated with sulfadiazine plus pyrimethamine.  These medications work synergistically to inhibit formation of tetrahydrofolate, a necessary cofactor for purine nucleotide synthesis.  ","clickable_1":"images/img1.20604.jpg"},

First-generation antihistamines are nonspecific and act as #antagonists# to multiple receptors, including the #muscarinic acetylcholine receptor#.  This leads to #anticholinergic# effects (eg, fever, urinary retention, decreased sweating, altered mental status).  In this patient, the flushing is likely a compensatory response to dissipate excess body heat due to decreased sweating, and the pupillary dilation is due to inhibition of the iris sphincter. $Although commonly described as H1 receptor antagonists, antihistamines are actually inverse agonists that stabilize the receptor in the inactive state.  H1 receptors are found in the vascular endothelium and bronchial smooth muscle, where they mediate vascular permeability and bronchoconstriction, as well as in the central nervous system where they are involved in alertness.  Antihistaminic effects relieve nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing, and itching.  First-generation antihistamines cross the blood-brain barrier and cause sedation.  By contrast, second-generation antihistamines (eg, loratadine) are more specific to the histamine H1 receptor and have less permeability through the blood-brain barrier; they are generally less effective than first-generation antihistamines but have significantly fewer side effects. $#(Choice A)#  Flushing and mydriasis are due to antagonism of the cholinergic receptor, not the H1 receptor. $#(Choice B)#  H2 receptors are found on parietal cells in the gastric mucosa.  H2 antagonists block gastric acid secretion by parietal cells. $#(Choice D)#  Nicotinic cholinergic receptors are found in sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia and on skeletal muscle cells at the neuromuscular junction.  Nicotinic receptor antagonists (eg, rocuronium) are used to induce paralysis in preparation for surgery or endotracheal intubation.  Adverse effects include hemodynamic instability (eg, hypotension) and respiratory insufficiency. $#(Choice E)#  Alpha-1 adrenoreceptors are located on smooth muscle and neurons.  Activation of these receptors increases smooth muscle tone of the iris dilator (causing mydriasis) and blood vessels (causing vasoconstriction); alpha-1 adrenergic agonists (eg, phenylephrine, oxymetazoline) can be used in patients with allergic rhinitis because their vasoconstrictive action reduces nasal congestion.  However, vasoconstriction inhibits flushing. $#Educational objective# First-generation antihistamines are nonspecific and interact with multiple receptors, including the muscarinic receptor.

In pharmacology, efficacy refers to the intrinsic ability of a drug to elicit an effect, such as receptor activation or dilation of a vessel as described in the question stem.  It is a measure of the maximum ceiling of activity [𝐄max]  of a drug with respect to a particular pharmacodynamic end point.  For example, loop diuretics such as furosemide or bumetanide will cause greater diuresis or natriuresis than any thiazide diuretic, irrespective of dose. $Potency, on the other hand, refers to the dose of drug that is required to produce a given effect.  The potency of a drug is primarily affected by the affinity of the drug for its receptor and the amount of drug that is able to reach the target tissues   Therefore, drugs that bind their receptors with a higher affinity or are better able to gain access to their target tissues will have greater potency.  The potency of different agents can be compared by determining the dose of drug that is required to produce one-half (50%) of the maximum biological response.  This dose is known as the ED₅₀.  The lower the ED₅₀ of a drug, the more potent it is.  For example, among the thiazide diuretics, 25mg of hydrochlorothiazide and 5mg chlorthalidone produce similar drops in blood pressure (similar efficacy), but chlorthalidone requires a lower dose, or lower ED₅₀, than HCTZ to cause a similar effect (higher potency). $With respect to the question, drug 2 and drug 3 have similar maximum effects (efficacy).  A much lower dose of drug 2 is required to produce the same effect as that seen with drug 3; therefore, drug 2 is more potent than drug 3 and has a lower ED₅₀.  To achieve this higher potency, the binding of drug 2 to its receptors (affinity) must be higher than that of drug 3 #(choice B),# or drug 2 must be better able to reach its target (penetration) than drug 3. $#(Choice A)# Drug 1 has higher potency than Drug 2 because at low biological activity, it can cause the same effect with much lower concentrations of drug.  However, it does not reach the same maximum effect as Drug 2. $#(Choice C)# Drug 1 demonstrates the lowest efficacy (ceiling of biological effect) of the three drugs graphed.  Lower efficacy may be a result of partial agonism and other factors.  $#(Choice D)# Drugs 2 and 3 exhibit a parallel shift in their relative biological effects exhibiting similar efficacy but different potency (The shapes of their graphs are identical, but at different dose ranges).  Drug 3 may contain the same basic pharmocologic agent as Drug 2 but with a competitive antagonist mixed in; thus, the 𝐄max is the same but the ED₅₀ is higher.  A competitive antagonist would bind to the same location as the original substance. $#(Choice E)# Drug 2 has a lower ED₅₀ (greater potency) than drug 3.  Both have equal efficacy. $#Educational objective #Efficacy is a measure of the maximum pharmacodynamic effect achievable with a drug.  Potency refers to the dose of drug that is required to produce a given effect.  Drugs that bind their receptors with a higher affinity or are better able to gain access to their target tissues will have greater potency (lower ED₅₀).  "},

This deficiency leads to the accumulation of glucocerebroside, a glycolipid component of cell membranes, within the lysosomes of macrophages, giving them the classic appearance of wrinkled tissue paper.  Characteristic symptoms (eg, hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, bone pain) develop as lipid-laden macrophages accumulate in the body's tissues (eg, spleen, liver, and bone). $Lysosomal storage diseases can be treated through the delivery of a #replacement enzyme# into the lysosomes of affected cells; in the case of Gaucher disease, #recombinant glucocerebrosidases# (eg, imiglucerase) are available to replace the deficient enzyme.  Almost all human enzymes, including lysosomal enzymes, are large polypeptides (eg, proteins) #(choice B).#  Although the oral route is often preferred for drug administration, most peptide-based drugs (eg, insulin, immunoglobulins) cannot be efficiently absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract due to the intestinal epithelial barrier and extensive proteolysis that takes place in the stomach and duodenum.  As a result, #large polypeptides# such as a glucocerebrosidase must be #administered intravenously# to achieve adequate circulating levels. $Once in the circulation, exogenous glucocerebrosidase can enter cells by binding to #mannose 6-phosphate receptors#.  These receptors are found in the Golgi network, where they help route newly synthesized lysosomal proteins (tagged by mannose 6-phosphate residues).  They are also expressed #on the cell surface#, where they bind free lysosomal enzymes that are accidentally secreted.  Exogenous glucocerebrosidase can bind to these cell surface receptors, inducing #endocytosis# of the bound enzyme.  It is then carried by endosomes to lysosomes, where it can degrade accumulated glucocerebrosides, reducing disease manifestations. $#(Choices C and D)#  Enzymes are large, polar polypeptides that are unable to effectively cross the cell membrane by passive diffusion.  In contrast, steroid-based drugs are typically hydrophobic and can easily cross cell membranes by passive diffusion.  However, steroidal drugs function by binding to receptors; they do not directly catalyze reactions. $#(Choices E, F, G, and H)#  Unlike in lysosomal storage diseases, enzyme replacement therapy for pancreatic exocrine insufficiency is administered orally because pancreatic digestive enzymes normally function within the gastrointestinal lumen. $#Educational objective# Certain lysosomal storage diseases, including Gaucher disease, can be treated with enzyme-replacement therapy (eg, recombinant glucocerebrosidase).  Because enzymes are large proteins that cannot be orally absorbed, the replacement enzyme must be administered intravenously.  Entry into the cell occurs by endocytosis after the replacement enzyme binds to mannose 6-phosphate receptors on the cell surface.  "},

Antagonists can be either competitive or noncompetitive.  Competitive antagonists bind to the exact same receptor binding sites as endogenous or exogenous agonists, thereby preventing agonist binding and activation of the receptor.  Competitive antagonism can be reversible (ionic bond) or irreversible (covalent bond).  The effect of a reversible competitive antagonist can be overcome by high concentrations of agonist, which cause displacement of the antagonist from the receptors by mass action. $Noncompetitive antagonists, on the other hand, bind to receptors at a site other than the primary agonist binding site, thereby causing a conformational (allosteric) change in the receptor protein that modifies the agonist binding site and prevents agonist binding.  By binding to a different site than the agonist, noncompetitive antagonists are able to remain bound to the receptor even when high concentrations of agonist are present because the agonist is unable to displace noncompetitive antagonists from the receptor.  $The question has asked how the curve for bethanechol #(Curve A)# would be affected by the introduction of a reversible competitive antagonist.  A reversible competitive antagonist is expected to require higher doses of the full agonist (bethanechol) to be present to achieve the same effect at each point along the curve.  If enough of the original substrate is added, the reaction can still reach the same maximum effect.  Thus, the log dose-response curve for a full agonist combined with a reversible competitive antagonist will exhibit a parallel shift to the right in the log-dose response curve, with an increase in the ED₅₀ and no change in the maximum effect (𝐄max). $#(Choice A)# Curve A is the dose-response curve for the original agonist drug in the absence of modifiers such as antagonists. $#(Choices B and C)# Both Curves B and C represent the effect of adding a noncompetitive antagonist to the agonist.  Note that the ED₅₀ is unchanged (i.e. the ED₅₀ for Curves A, B and C occur at the exact same log drug concentration).  This is a distinguishing characteristic of noncompetitive antagonism.  The maximum effect (𝐄max) of Curves B and C are reduced because the noncompetitive antagonist has effectively reduced the number of receptors available for binding.  The decrease in 𝐄max will depend on the dose of noncompetitive antagonist present and is illustrated by the difference between Curves B and C, where a higher concentration of antagonist is present in Curve C than in Curve B. $#(Choice D)# Curve D illustrates a rightward shift in the dose-response relationship, but the shift is not a parallel shift because the shape of the curve differs from that of Curve A, with changes in both 𝐄max and ED₅₀.  This curve is not characteristic of any single antagonist effect and may be the result of adding multiple types of antagonists. $#Educational objective# The changes in the log dose-response curve expected for the effect of a reversible competitive antagonist added to a full agonist are: 1) a parallel shift to the right in the log-dose response curve, illustrating an increase in the ED₅₀, and 2) no change in the maximum effect (𝐄max).  $* Competitive=change ED₅₀=shift right; noncompetitive=change 𝐄max=shift down.
