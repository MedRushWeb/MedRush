Defects in the mucosal or cutaneous barrier can lead to invasion.  The most common manifestation is #skin and soft-tissue abscess#; patients usually develop a localized pustule that evolves over days into a painful nodule with a necrotic, purulent center and surrounding indurated erythema.  Treatment with incision/drainage and oral antibiotics is usually curative of the localized infection.  However, oral antibiotics do not eliminate S aureus colonization of the nares and skin so #recurrent infections# are common. $Colonization with methicillin-sensitive S aureus (MSSA) is associated with a low risk of illness.  In contrast,# #methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) colonization is much more likely to cause disease due to expression of associated virulence factors (eg, leukocidin). $#(Choice B)#  Latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis is characterized by the presence of organisms in walled-off granulomas.  Patients with latent tuberculosis are asymptomatic and most will never have reactivation of disease.  Reactivation is classically characterized by the formation of apical, cavitary lesions in the lung, weight loss, and cough. $#(Choice C)#  Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular organism that invades as a small elementary body and then evolves to the metabolically active reticulate body once inside host cells.  Recurrent Chlamydia symptoms (eg, dysuria, purulent urethra discharge) in patients who have been adequately treated (eg, azithromycin) usually indicates a new infection due to continued high-risk behavior (eg, unprotected sex). $#(Choice D)#  Scabies is a skin mite (Sarcoptes scabiei) that causes intensely pruritic eruptions, particularly of the finger webs, wrists, axilla, areola, and genitalia.  The mite burrows into the epidermis and lays eggs.  Topical treatment with permethrin is usually curative, but recurrence can occur if close contacts and environmental harbors (eg, sheets) are not adequately treated. $#(Choice E)#  Clostridium difficile spores are hardy and resistant to heat and soap.  Infection usually causes colitis with watery diarrhea, fever, and abdominal pain.  Recurrent infection after treatment with oral antibiotics (eg, vancomycin) is common and may require a repeat pharmacologic treatment or, in some cases, fecal transplant. $#Educational objective# Staphylococcus aureus is the most common cause of skin and soft-tissue abscess (eg, furuncle).  Treatment of the abscess with incision and drainage and antibiotics can eliminate the local infection but does not eliminate colonization of the anterior nares and skin.

In this patient, cerebrospinal fluid shows #gram-positive cocci in chains# with a narrow zone of hemolysis indicating #GBS infection#. $GBS is highly virulent due to the presence of a thick #polysaccharide capsule# composed of galactose with terminal #sialic acid# (SA) residues.  These bacterial SA moieties are identical to SA epitopes on glycoproteins/glycolipids of host cells (#molecular mimicry#), allowing the bacteria to evade host defenses.  SA residues interact with receptors on phagocytes and are recognized as self, which #down-regulates phagocytosis#, oxidative burst generation, and production of neutrophil extracellular traps.  SA residues also inhibit binding of the opsonin C3b (limits opsonophagocytosis) and the generation of the anaphylatoxin C5a (limits immune cell recruitment). $#(Choice A)#  Antigenic variation involves rapid mutation of surface antigens, which limits the ability of immunoglobulin formed during previous infection to prevent future infections.  It is seen primarily with viruses (eg, influenza) and certain bacteria (eg, Neisseria meningitidis); however, GBS is virulent primarily due to SA on its capsule, not antigenic variation. $#(Choice B)#  Catalase-producing organisms (eg, Listeria, Staphylococcus) can break down hydrogen peroxide to oxygen and water, which limits oxidative damage.  Listeria monocytogenes can cause neonatal meningitis, but Gram stain would show gram-positive rods, not cocci; Staphylococcus species are an uncommon cause of neonatal meningitis and are gram-positive cocci in clusters, not chains. $#(Choice C)#  Increased uptake of extracellular iron, an essential micronutrient for most bacteria, is not a major virulence factor for Streptococcus species. $#(Choice D)#  Lipopolysaccharide is a major virulence factor of gram-negative bacteria such as E coli.

Chronic cardiac inflammation can progress to rheumatic heart disease, specifically valvular disease.  The #mitral valve# is the most commonly affected and gradually thickens, fibroses, and calcifies, eventually requiring valvotomy or more invasive surgical intervention. $#Empiric therapy# for a condition must be considered in the context of the host characteristics, pre-test probability of the disease, benefits/risks of waiting for a definitive diagnosis, and cost of therapy versus its potential complications.  If all cases of acute streptococcal pharyngitis were treated empirically, the incidence of rheumatic heart disease and associated cardiac procedures would likely decrease. $#(Choice A)#  Antibiotic use can promote diarrhea by altering the gut microbial milieu.  This alteration can lead to overgrowth of Clostridium difficile, a gram-positive bacterium that can cause profuse, watery diarrhea and life-threatening fulminant colitis.  Therefore, increasing antibiotic use would likely result in increased diarrheal illness and potential complications. $#(Choice B)#  Serum sickness-like reactions are associated with certain infections (eg, hepatitis B) and antibiotics (eg, penicillin).

Young adults with CF typically have several @manifestations@ of the disorder, including pancreatic insufficiency (eg, diarrhea), chronic sinusitis, nasal polyps, and chronic bronchitis (eg, long-standing productive cough, hyperinflated lungs, barrel chest).  However, #persistent lower respiratory tract infection# is the major source of morbidity and death. $Early in the course of the disease, thick airway secretions obstruct mucociliary clearance and lead to the colonization of the lower respiratory tract with pathogenic bacteria.  Although Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus are seen in children with CF, #Pseudomonas aeruginosa# is the major pathogen in #adults#.  This organism forms a biofilm and switches to a mucoid phenotype to prevent its full elimination (even with antibiotics).  Neutrophils respond by releasing elastase, myeloperoxidase, and reactive oxygen species, but these compounds are insufficient to clear the infection and progressively destroy the walls of the airway, leading to #bronchiectasis #and respiratory decline. $#(Choice A)#  Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a hypersensitivity reaction to Aspergillus fumigatus that primarily manifests with asthma-like symptoms.

S epidermidis is adept at causing foreign body infections because of its ability to form biofilms. $Once introduced into the body, foreign bodies quickly become coated with a layer of host proteins, including fibrinogen and fibronectin.  These proteins then serve as binding sites for S epidermidis.  After attachment occurs, the bacteria multiply and communicate with one another to induce synthesis of an extracellular polysaccharide matrix that encases the bacteria.  The resulting biofilm functions as a barrier to antibiotic penetration and interferes with host defenses, including opsonization, neutrophil migration, and even T lymphocyte activation.  Once mature, these biofilms can disperse individual pathogen \"seeds\" (planktonic cells) into the bloodstream and surrounding areas, further disseminating the infection.  Definitive treatment of infections caused by @biofilm-producing organisms@ often requires removal of the foreign body. $#(Choice A)#  S epidermidis is not an intracellular organism.  Examples of obligate intracellular organisms include Chlamydiae and Rickettsiae.  Facultative intracellular organisms include Legionella, Listeria, Mycobacterium, Neisseria, and Salmonella. $#(Choice B)#  S epidermidis is not an encapsulated bacterium.  Examples of encapsulated bacteria are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type B, and Neisseria meningitidis.  Asplenic individuals are unable to opsonize encapsulated pathogens and are at risk of infection from these organisms. $#(Choice C)#  Protein A is a surface protein found on the cell wall of Staphylococcus aureus that binds to the Fc region of immunoglobulins.  S aureus uses Protein A to inhibit opsonization and phagocytic engulfment. $#(Choice D)#  Exotoxin production is not a known pathogenic mechanism of S epidermidis.

DGI is one of the most common causes of #septic arthritis# in young, sexually active individuals.  It is due to the spread of #Neisseria gonorrhoeae# from a (usually asymptomatic) genitourinary infection into the systemic circulation.  Patients typically present with either purulent arthritis or the triad of polyarthralgia, dermatitis, and tenosynovitis; however, some overlap in these 2 syndromes can occur (as in this patient).  Microscopy of blood, urine, or joint fluid samples will often reveal @gram-negative intracellular diplococci@. $#(Choice B)#  Salmonella appears as a gram-negative oxidase-negative rod.

Both strains penetrate enterocytes, where they travel in vacuoles from the apical to the basolateral end of the cell and invade the lamina propria.  However, the pathogenesis then diverges, as follows: $• Nontyphoidal strains (eg, S Enteritidis) are phagocytosed by neutrophils and macrophages in the lamina propria and induce a massive inflammatory response with neutrophilic infiltration.  This cytokine-mediated response causes gastroenteritis (eg, watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever), which usually self-resolves, as in this patient's prior history. $• In contrast, #typhoidal strains# contain specialized virulence factors (eg, Vi capsular antigen) that #inhibit neutrophil recruitment and phagocytosis#, limiting the acute inflammatory response that helps contain nontyphoidal species.  It also inhibits macrophages from generating an oxidative burst to destroy the bacteria, allowing the pathogen to undergo extensive, #unchecked intraphagocytic replication# and dissemination through the lymphatic and reticuloendothelial system.  This results in typhoid fever, as seen in this patient. $Manifestations begin approximately a week after transmission of the typhoidal strain, which typically occurs via consumption of food or water contaminated by human feces in regions of poor sanitation.  Initial symptoms include an #escalating fever# that is often associated with relative bradycardia (#pulse-temperature dissociation#).

Symptoms include bloody diarrhea and/or extraintestinal manifestations (eg, liver abscess).  Rash is uncommon, and blood cultures would not show gram-negative rods. $#(Choice B)#  Campylobacter infection causes acute, self-limited diarrhea (<7 days) and may result in cross-reacting antibodies to ganglioside GM1, leading to Guillain-Barré syndrome.  Rose spots, hepatosplenomegaly, and pulse-temperature dissociation would not be expected. $#(Choice D)#  Rotavirus and Giardia damage intestinal villi, leading to intestinal malabsorption due to villous blunting and decreased levels of brush border enzymes (eg, maltase, lactase). $#Educational objective# Typhoidal strains of Salmonella contain a capsular antigen (Vi) and other virulence factors that inhibit neutrophil phagocytosis, neutrophil recruitment, and macrophage-mediated destruction.

The second mechanism of resistance occurs through modification of the protein target binding site for isoniazid.  Treatment of active tuberculosis is accomplished by combining multiple antibiotics to avoid selecting for resistant strains.

However, this is not the case.  Isoniazid can reach therapeutic levels within macrophages, areas of caseous necrosis, and cerebrospinal fluid. $#(Choice B)#  Decreased transport protein expression at the cell surface would interfere with the effectiveness of drugs that require protein-mediated transport into the bacterial cell to reach the intended target (eg, fluoroquinolones, macrolides, aminoglycosides). $#(Choice C)#  β-lactamase induction within bacterial cells would not result from isoniazid exposure because isoniazid is not a beta-lactam antibiotic. $#(Choice D)#  Rapid mycobacterial elimination from the body occurs when a small inoculum is recognized and quickly destroyed by the cell-mediated immune system.

However, infections can occur in those who received inadequate childhood vaccines or those who did not receive booster vaccination every 10 years. $The manifestations of diphtheria are due to the elaboration of #diphtheria toxin# (DT), an exotoxin that #irreversibly inhibits host protein synthesis# by ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor-2.  Local effects include pharyngitis and tonsillitis, often with thick, #grey-white pseudomembranes#.  Systemic effects are caused by the absorption of DT into the bloodstream and include potentially life-threatening cardiac (eg, myocarditis) and neurologic complications. $The primary treatment for diphtheria is the urgent administration of #diphtheria antitoxin#, which contains #preformed#, #neutralizing antibodies# that binds and inactivates circulating toxin.  Because it cannot inhibit the toxin that has already entered cells, it should be administered as soon as possible.  Antibiotic therapy (eg, penicillin, erythromycin) is also given to reduce continued elaboration of DT from the nasopharyngeal infection. $#(Choice A)#  Inhaled, racemic epinephrine can be used in the treatment of croup, which usually presents with cough, inspiratory stridor, and/or hoarseness.  Epinephrine could reduce airway swelling in patients with diphtheria, but it would not inhibit the local and systemic effects of the toxin. $#(Choice B)#  C diphtheriae is noninvasive and does not typically enter the bloodstream.  Although antibiotics are administered in acute infection, this component of therapy is less important than providing antitoxin to neutralize DT. $#(Choice C)#  Corticosteroids are sometimes used in the treatment of epiglottitis to reduce airway inflammation and limit the risk of airway compromise.  Epiglottitis manifestations typically include stridor, drooling, respiratory distress, and the assumption of the \"tripod\" position.  Most cases are caused by infection with Haemophilus influenzae type B in unvaccinated individuals. $#(Choice E)#  Active immunization with the diphtheria toxoid (given as part of the childhood DTaP vaccine) prevents diphtheria.  Diphtheria toxoid can also be given as part of tetanus boosters in adults.  However, the immune response to vaccination is slow; in undervaccinated patients who are acutely ill, administration of preformed antitoxin antibodies is preferred. $#Educational objective# The primary treatment for diphtheria is diphtheria antitoxin (passive immunization), which inactivates circulating toxin.  Antibiotics should also be administered to reduce continued production of toxin.  "},

Of the given options, the organism with the lowest ID₅₀ is #Shigella flexneri#.  Depending on the species, as few as 10 Shigella organisms can cause disease. $The low ID₅₀ of Shigella is related to virulence factors expressed in various locations in the gastrointestinal tract: $• Stomach:  Shigella can #survive a low-pH environment#, the primary reason for its low ID₅₀.  On exposure to acidic conditions, Shigella species upregulate the transcription of #pH-resistant virulence genes#, making them relatively resistant to degradation in the stomach.  This characteristic is in contrast to the acid-sensitivity of Salmonella, which contributes to its higher ID₅₀. $• Proximal small intestine:  Bile salts are normally bactericidal, but exposure to them upregulates production of adhesin proteins and promotes formation of Shigella biofilms. $• Distal small intestine:  Shigella invades cells forming the epithelial barrier and can spread to other cells laterally (ie, cell-to-cell spread) without reentering the gut lumen. $Other organisms that can cause diarrhea with a small inoculum include Campylobacter jejuni (500 organisms), Entamoeba histolytica (1-10), and Giardia lamblia (1-10). $#(Choices A and D)#  Like Salmonella, Clostridium perfringens and Vibrio cholerae are acid sensitive and thrive in more alkaline conditions, requiring a relatively high ID₅₀ (104-108). $#(Choice B)#  Some strains of Escherichia coli that cause gastroenteritis (eg, Shiga toxin–producing E coli) have a low ID₅₀ due to their ability to survive an acidic environment, similar to Shigella.

In contrast, Yersinia enterocolitica (fecal-oral transmission, diarrheal illness) has a higher ID₅₀; although this bacterium produces urease, making it somewhat acid resistant, its growth is improved in more alkaline conditions. $#Educational objective# Shigella species require a low infectious dose to cause gastrointestinal disease.

Pertussis is caused by the gram-negative bacterium Bordetella pertussis and spreads via respiratory droplets.  The greatest risk factor is lack of immunization, and older children/adults with mild disease are often the source of infection. $Pertussis is a #prolonged illness# that typically progresses through 3 stages:  catarrhal (mild rhinorrhea or cough), paroxysmal (bouts of severe cough), and convalescent (weeks to months of gradual resolution).

It is characterized by the triad of renal insufficiency, thrombocytopenia, and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia.  Most cases occur due to underlying #enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli# (EHEC) infection, particularly with the O157:H7 serotype. $EHEC is a gram-negative, enteric rod that acquires the ability to produce #Shiga toxin# from a lysogenic bacteriophage.

The absorption of Shiga toxin into the systemic circulation causes glomerular (renal insufficiency) and vascular (thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia) injury in a minority of patients, leading to HUS. $The primary reservoir for EHEC is the gastrointestinal tract of healthy cattle.  Humans primarily acquire the organism after consuming contaminated, #undercooked beef#.

The superantigen/MHC-II complex subsequently interacts with the variable part of the T-cell receptor beta chain, which results in the #nonspecific stimulation# of a large percentage (>20%) of total #T cells# and the massive release of inflammatory cytokines (eg, IL-1, IL-2, TNF-alpha & beta, interferon-gamma).  Cytokine release mediates the major manifestations of TSS including fever, increased capillary permeability, and hypotension. $#(Choice A)#  Endotoxin in the cell membrane of gram-negative bacteria can cause rapid-onset fever and hypotension due to activation of toll-like receptors on cells of the innate immune system.  However, in this case, the presence of nasal packing and a diffuse, erythematous rash make TSS far more likely than gram-negative sepsis. $#(Choice C)#  Anaphylactic shock occurs due to antigen-stimulated cross-linking of IgE that is bound to basophils or mast cells, which activates the cell and releases massive amounts of inflammatory mediators.  Anaphylactic shock is typically characterized by hypotension, bronchospasm, and shortness of breath; most cases are triggered by insect stings, food, or medications, and manifestations occur shortly after exposure. $#(Choice D)#  Patients who develop TSS usually have a noninvasive infection in the vaginal canal or area of wound packing.  TSS is mediated by the absorption of superantigens into the blood, not the invasion of bacteria. $#Educational objective# Toxic shock syndrome is typically associated with the prolonged use of tampons or wound packing, which allows Staphylococcus aureus to replicate locally and release pyrogenic toxic superantigens (eg, toxic shock syndrome toxin-1) into the blood.

In these individuals, an #impaired lymphocyte response# results in minimal or no induration after exposure to tuberculin antigens.  Because a weak cell-mediated response increases the #risk of severe disseminated TB#, patients with active disease who have TST anergy are at much greater risk for TB-related morbidity and mortality. $A false-negative TST can also be seen with recent infection (it takes approximately 8 weeks for the cell mediated response to fully form), immunocompromise (eg, HIV), improper injection technique, and natural waning of immunity to latent infection.  Because active TB requires a microbial diagnosis (eg, identifying the organism on sputum sample), neither TST nor interferon-gamma release assay can be used to diagnose or exclude the disease. $#(Choice A)#  Bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccination uses Mycobacterium bovis, which shares antigens with tuberculous mycobacteria.  This vaccination primes the lymphocyte response against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, therefore protecting against infection, morbidity, and mortality.  Patients with previous BCG vaccination can have false-positive (not false negative) TST. $#(Choice B)#  TB infection is primarily controlled by macrophages and T lymphocytes.  The humoral immune system plays a minimal role and does not contribute to TST induration.  Therefore, an autoantibody disorder is unlikely to cause anergy. $#(Choice D)#  Examination of the injection site should occur 48-72 hours after the purified protein derivative is injected in order to give appropriate time for the delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to develop.  Patients with active TB who have a negative TST at 72 hours are likely to have an insufficient lymphocyte response to the infection. $#(Choice E)#  Acid-fast bacillus stain and TST do not differentiate nontuberculous from tuberculous mycobacteria.

However, transmission to humans occasionally occurs when B anthracis #spores# are inhaled, ingested, or inoculated into the skin. $Inhalation of spores into the alveoli causes #pulmonary anthrax#.  Alveolar macrophages phagocytose the spores and bring them to mediastinal lymph nodes, where the spores germinate into vegetative rods and multiply.  The vegetative form of the bacteria contains a #polypeptide capsule# composed of #D-glutamic acid#, which is antiphagocytic.  B anthracis rods also produce a potent #exotoxin complex# composed of edema factor, lethal factor, and protective antigen, which enter host cells and cause cell death. $Initial manifestations of infection are nonspecific (eg, myalgia, fever, malaise), but proliferation of the bacteria in the mediastinum eventually causes #hemorrhagic mediastinitis# (often visible on chest x-ray as a widened mediastinum).

However, #urine dipstick# is usually performed initially because it rapidly assesses for UTI pending culture results. $The #most specific# dipstick finding for bacterial UTI is #nitrites#.  Pathophysiology involves production of nitrate reductase by certain bacteria (eg, E coli, Klebsiella, Proteus); this bacterial enzyme reduces normal urinary nitrate (NO3−) to nitrite (NO2−).  The level of nitrites #correlates# with the #incubation time of bacteria# in the bladder. $In patients with UTI caused by nitrate reductase–producing bacteria, dipstick analysis performed on the #first voided urine# in the morning is usually #positive# due to prolonged overnight bacterial incubation (>4 hr), allowing nitrites to accumulate.

However, resistance would not affect bacteria's ability to produce nitrate reductase, and therefore does not explain this patient's new finding of nitrites. $#(Choice E)#  Bacterial contaminants can alter culture results due to the prolonged incubation time of the test.  However, the short duration between urine collection and dipstick analysis is insufficient for nitrite production from contaminants.  Moreover, contaminants that can produce nitrites are typically from the stool, not the skin. $#Educational objective# Nitrites on dipstick are highly specific for urinary tract infections.

Its specificity is derived from its #inhibition of mycolic acid synthesis#.  Mycolic acids form long branched-chain fatty acids in the outer portion of the mycobacterial peptidoglycan cell wall; they are essential for proper #cell wall# structure and virulence factor synthesis (eg, sulfatides, wax D, cord factor).  When mycobacteria are unable to synthesize mycolic acids, they lose the fidelity of the cell wall and are unable to divide to form new cells. $Mycolic acids in the cell wall are what cause mycobacteria to be #acid-fast#.  This property is due to the retention of a stain (eg, carbolfuchsin dye) despite exposure to an acid-alcohol decolorizing agent.  If the quantity of mycolic acids in the cell wall is reduced (eg, following exposure to isoniazid), the organism will lose the color of the stain when exposed to an acid-alcohol agent. $#(Choice A)#  Fluoroquinolones (eg, ciprofloxacin) can be used as part of a multi-drug regimen to treat some forms of drug resistant tuberculosis.

Fluoroquinolones would not have a direct effect on the acid-fastness of mycobacteria. $#(Choice C)#  Rifampin is an essential component of the multi-drug regimen used to treat active tuberculosis.

This restricts mycobacterial cell growth and leads to cell death.  However, the acid-fastness of the organism is not affected.  Streptomycin is also indicated in the treatment of plague (caused by Yersinia pestis) and tularemia (caused by Francisella tularensis). $#(Choice E)#  Vancomycin binds to D-alanyl-D-alanine residues, inhibiting polymerization and cross-linking of the glycopeptides forming the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria (not mycobacteria). $#Educational objective# Isoniazid is an antimycobacterial agent that specifically inhibits the synthesis of mycolic acids, which are essential components of the mycobacterial peptidoglycan cell wall.  Without mycolic acids, the mycobacteria lose their acid-fastness and become unable to synthesize new cell walls or multiply.  "},

The infection is not invasive and does not disseminate outside of the gastrointestinal tract.  However, the elaboration of the cholera enterotoxin leads to #severe, watery diarrhea# that can cause death from electrolyte imbalance and dehydration within 12 hours of symptom onset.  Cholera is endemic in southern Asia and parts of Africa and Latin America, where seasonal outbreaks are common (peaks occur prior to and after rainy seasons).  In the United States, the disease is rare and occurs mainly in patients who ingest contaminated seafood from the Gulf Coast. $V cholerae must survive the acidic environment of the stomach to reach the small intestine and cause disease.  Because the organism is very #acid-sensitive#, a high burden of V cholerae is generally required to cause clinical symptoms (>1010 organisms from contaminated water or >106 organisms from contaminated food).

Most cases are transmitted by aerosolized droplets from asymptomatic carriers or infected patients.  Although the pathogen has little capacity for invasion, it generates a #potent exotoxin# (diphtheria toxin) that irreversibly inhibits protein synthesis through ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor-2, leading to host cell death and necrosis.

Risk is greatest in those who handle contaminated hides, animal hair (eg, wool), or carcasses.  Cutaneous exposure usually results in a painless papule that rapidly ulcerates and subsequently turns into a black eschar. $B anthracis spores germinate at tissue temperatures into vegetative rods that have 2 main virulence factors: $• A #polypeptide capsule# composed of poly-γ-D-glutamic acid, which inhibits phagocytosis $• A #trimeric exotoxin# composed of protective antigen, edema factor, and lethal factor $Protective antigen binds to a host cell membrane receptor on macrophages and forms a channel that delivers lethal factor and edema factor into the cell.  Lethal factor is a zinc metalloproteinase that inhibits MAP kinase signal transduction, leading to cell death.

GAS pharyngitis is not typically due to exotoxins and does not classically cause local neuropathies (eg, soft palate paralysis). $#(Choice B)#  Lecithinase (also known as phospholipase C, or Clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin) is the exotoxin released by C perfringens.  This enzyme degrades membrane phospholipids (including lecithin), leading to cell membrane destruction and cell death.  C perfringens causes gas gangrene. $#(Choice C)#  The shiga toxin of Shigella and the shigalike toxin of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) cause inactivation of the 60S ribosomal subunit.  By contrast, diphtheria toxin inactivates EF-2, not the ribosome itself.  Shigella and EHEC cause diarrheal illnesses. $#(Choice D)#  Pertussis toxin is an AB exotoxin released by Bordetella pertussis that catalyzes ribosylation of G protein αi subunits.  This results in increased cAMP production, which leads to increased insulin production, lymphocyte and neutrophil dysfunction, and increased sensitivity to histamine.  Classic pertussis has a catarrhal stage (mild upper respiratory symptoms), a paroxysmal stage (whooping cough), and a convalescent stage. $#Educational objective# Diphtheria toxin is an AB exotoxin that ribosylates and inactivates elongation factor-2.  This action inhibits protein synthesis and ultimately leads to cell death.  "},

Clinical manifestations are widely variable depending on the strength of the TH1 cell-mediated immune response to the organism.  Disease is classified along a spectrum between tuberculoid (mild) to lepromatous (severe) forms.  Patients with tuberculoid leprosy develop a strong TH1-mediated response (interleukin [IL]-2, IFN-γ, and IL-12) in affected tissues, leading to the activation of macrophages that kill M leprae organisms, thereby limiting disease extent.  However, this localized inflammation damages the skin and cutaneous nerves, leading to the development of a small number of hypopigmented, well-demarcated plaques with decreased sensation. $Lepromatous leprosy is a more disseminated form of the disease characterized by an innate inability to recognize and mount a cellular immune response against M leprae antigens.  Affected tissues show extensive accumulation of acid-fast bacilli within macrophages and often a TH2 cytokine profile (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10).  Patients with lepromatous leprosy develop more numerous, poorly demarcated plaques that are widespread across the body.  Over time, the bacterial load increases and the nodular lesions coalesce, causing the development of leonine facies and degeneration and loss of the nose and digits. $The lepromin skin test (in which M leprae antigens are injected intradermally) can be used to distinguish between tuberculoid and lepromatous leprosy.  Patients with tuberculoid leprosy will develop an indurated nodule at the site of the injection (much like a positive PPD test for M tuberculosis).  In contrast, the test is usually nonreactive in patients with lepromatous leprosy due to their weak TH1 cell-mediated immune response. $#(Choice A)#  Patients with lepromatous leprosy have a high bacterial load with widespread involvement throughout the peripheral (cooler) tissues of the body.  As a result, intermittent bacteremia often occurs in the later stages of the disease.  However, this patient's few lesions and positive lepromin skin test are more indicative of tuberculoid leprosy, which has a very low bacterial load with limited tissue involvement. $#(Choice B)#  High serum antimycobacterial antibody levels are more frequently seen in lepromatous leprosy than tuberculous leprosy.  Because M leprae resides mostly within macrophages, circulating immunoglobulins have little access to the organism and are unable to bind, opsonize, or fix complement.  Humoral immunity does not influence the positivity of the lepromin skin test. $#(Choice C)#  In lepromatous leprosy, macrophages remain inactivated due to the inability of TH1 cells to recognize M leprae antigens.  This form of leprosy is characterized by a poor cell-mediated response and diffuse spread of the organism.  This patient is presenting with the tuberculoid form, in which activated macrophages actively kill M leprae organisms. $#(Choice E)#  Acid-fast bacteria typically do not accumulate in the skin lesions of tuberculoid leprosy due to the strong cell-mediated response that is effective at eradicating M leprae.  In some instances, this immune response is so effective that tuberculoid leprosy can be self-limited and heal completely without treatment. $#Educational objective# The lepromin skin test will be positive in patients with tuberculoid leprosy as they exhibit a strong CD4+ TH1 cell-mediated immune response to Mycobacterium leprae.  Patients with lepromatous leprosy will test negative due to their weak TH1 cell-mediated immune response.  "}
