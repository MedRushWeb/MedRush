Acute dystonia can develop abruptly anytime between 4 hours and 4 days after receiving an antipsychotic medication.  The condition is characterized by a sudden, involuntary contraction of a major muscle group.  Other examples of acute dystonia include oculogyric crisis (forced, sustained elevation of the eyes in an upward position), opisthotonus (arching of the back with the head thrown backward), and, rarely, laryngospasm.

The mutant mRNAs form hairpin structures and accumulate in the nucleus, sequestering certain RNA-binding proteins and leading to aberrant splicing.  Nondividing cells of the brain, skeletal muscles, and myocardium are particularly affected.  "},

Defective snRNP assembly results in impaired spliceosome function and degeneration of anterior horn cells in the spinal cord. $RNA molecules that carry out functions without first being translated into proteins are called non-coding RNAs.  These include small nuclear RNA (snRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and transfer RNA (tRNA).  snRNA is transcribed by RNA polymerase II and associates with specific proteins to form snRNPs.  A collection of snRNPs and other proteins on pre-mRNA is referred to as a #spliceosome#.  Spliceosomes #remove introns# from pre-mRNA by cleaving the 5' end of intron 1 (splice donor site) and joining that end to the branch point.

Nucleosomes are important for the compact packaging of DNA into chromosomes with the aid of other packaging proteins. $#(Choice B)#  Peroxisomes are cytoplasmic organelles containing oxidative enzymes (eg, catalase, D-amino acid oxidase, uric acid oxidase).  These organelles are ubiquitous among eukaryotes and are most abundant in the liver and kidneys, where detoxification of ingested and environmental materials occurs.  In the liver, peroxisomes also play a role in the breakdown of fatty acids. $#(Choice C)#  Proteasomes and lysosomes are responsible for protein/polypeptide degradation.  Proteasomes mainly degrade intracellular proteins, whereas lysosomes degrade extracellular proteins and worn-out organelles. $#(Choice D)#  Ribosomes are present in the cytoplasm and are required for translation of mRNA into protein.  Individual ribosomes are comprised of rRNA and ribosomal proteins.  Within the cell, rRNA engages mRNA and facilitates tRNA entry during the formation of polypeptide chains. $#Educational objective# Small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) are important components of the spliceosome, a molecule which removes introns from pre-mRNA during processing within the nucleus.

Because the NF1 gene product (neurofibromin) functions as a tumor suppressor protein, loss of expression leads to uncontrolled cellular proliferation that affects multiple systems. $NF1 has complete penetrance—all patients who inherit the gene develop some phenotypic traits—but individual expression is highly variable.  The following @findings@ are most common, some or all of which may be present in an individual with NF1: $• Neurofibromas:  #Neurofibromas# are benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors that most commonly affect the skin and are typically multiple in number. $• Skin:  #Café au lait spots# are flat, hyperpigmented macules or patches with distinct margins that usually appear within the first year after birth.  Skinfold freckling in the axillary or inguinal regions is a highly characteristic cutaneous feature of NF1. $• Eyes:  #Lisch nodules# are raised, pigmented, hamartomas of the iris that do not affect vision.

FXS is caused by a mutation of the fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1) gene on the long arm of the X chromosome. $FMR1 normally has 6 to 50 CGG trinucleotide repeats in the 5′ untranslated region that can potentially expand during meiosis in oocytes.  Expansion over generations can lead to #>200 CGG trinucleotide repeats# (ie, full mutation), which causes #FMR1 hypermethylation#.  DNA methylation in the promoter region of FMR1 prevents transcription of the gene and subsequent production of fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein (FMRP). $Because FMRP is involved in development and plasticity of neurons, silencing of the gene in FXS results in impaired neural development.  Early findings include #developmental delay# and #neurobehavioral# features (eg, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder), as seen in this patient with speech delay and poor social skills.  @Physical findings@ of FXS are subtle until puberty, at which time macroorchidism and dysmorphic facies (eg, long, narrow face; prominent forehead and chin) become more noticeable. $#(Choice A)#  Imprinting refers to physiologic gene expression from only 1 parental allele rather than from both.  Disease occurs when there is a deletion of the allele that is normally expressed, as in Prader-Willi syndrome (paternally inherited deletion of part of chromosome 15).  The severity of FXS depends on the number of trinucleotide repeats or sex of the patient (ie, boys have more severe presentations), not the parental origin of the mutation. $#(Choice B)#  Defects in DNA mismatch repair genes cause Lynch syndrome, a condition with an increased risk of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer and extraintestinal malignancies.  Although mismatch repair may have a role in expanding trinucleotide repeats over successive generations, clinical features of FXS do not occur without hypermethylation-induced silencing of FMR1. $#(Choices C and D)#  @Exons@ (#ex#pressed cod#ons#) are protein coding regions of DNA.

The infant has 3 healthy, living siblings; a brother died in infancy from \"low sugar in his blood.\"  Physical examination is notable for tachypnea and signs of dehydration.  The patient is responsive to painful stimuli only.  After acute treatment and stabilization, urine testing reveals a significantly elevated methylmalonic acid level.  Which of the following sets of laboratory findings is most likely to be found in this patient?

This metabolic pathway funnels specific amino acids (isoleucine, valine, threonine, methionine) and odd-chain fatty acids into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (propionyl-CoA → methylmalonyl-CoA → succinyl-CoA → TCA cycle). $Mutations in methylmalonyl-CoA mutase result in the #accumulation of organic acids# (eg, propionic acid, methylmalonic acid), leading to the following characteristic signs of organic acidemia: $• #Metabolic acidosis# with respiratory compensation (ie, tachypnea) $• Altered glucose metabolism resulting in #hypoglycemia# with increased #ketone production# (can worsen the metabolic acidosis) $• #Hyperammonemia# (organic acids impair urea cycle function) $These severe metabolic derangements frequently develop within the first 1 to 2 weeks of life, causing altered mental status (ie, obtundation, poor feeding) and vomiting (ie, dehydration).  Diagnosis is suggested by elevated #urine propionic acid# and methylmalonic acid.  @Propionic acidemia@ is another branched-chain organic acidemia/aciduria that presents similarly to methylmalonic acidemia, but urine methylmalonic acid levels are not elevated. $#(Choices A and E)#  Ketone production in the presence of hypoglycemia is a normal response to a fasted state.  However, this patient's elevated urine methylmalonic acid level and notable family history make methylmalonic aciduria more likely. $#(Choice C)#  @Fatty acid oxidation disorders@ (eg, medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency) can present with hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, and metabolic acidosis.  However, propionic acid and ketone levels would not be elevated. $#(Choice D)#  @Urea cycle@ defects typically present with hyperammonemia without hypoglycemia, ketosis, or abnormal propionic acid levels. $#Educational objective# Methylmalonic acidemia is an organic acidemia/aciduria in newborns caused by deficiency of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase.  Laboratory findings include elevated propionic acid, hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis (ketone-mediated), and hyperammonemia.

{"id":"587","title":"A 5-year-old boy is brought to the office due to concerns about his speech and motor skills.  The patient has a history of speech delay, and his parents say that his speech has become more slurred lately.  He also has an unsteady, staggering gait that has progressively worsened over the past year.  In addition, the mother states that the patient's eyes and head \"do not move smoothly\" when he looks at moving objects.  Medical history is significant for recurrent ear and pulmonary infections.  Vital signs are normal.  Physical examination reveals numerous superficial nests of distended capillaries on the face and ears that blanch with pressure.

This #autosomal recessive# condition is caused by a defect in the ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) gene. $ATM kinase normally plays a role in the detection of DNA damage (eg, oxidative injury) through phosphorylation of various proteins, which then halt the cell cycle to allow for #DNA break repair#.  Without this surveillance mechanism, DNA is susceptible to ionizing radiation and prone to chromosomal breakage; accumulation of DNA mutations also increases the risk of malignant transformation. $Neurons are particularly prone to oxidative stress, and the first manifestations of AT are typically due to cerebellar degeneration.  #Unsteady gait# progressively worsens in early childhood, and patients often display delayed and slurred (#dysarthria#) speech.  Impaired head/eye coordination (#oculomotor apraxia#) is also common. $In addition, defective DNA rearrangement in developing lymphocytes often results in cellular and humoral immunodeficiency and recurrent #sinopulmonary infections#.  Diagnosis is often delayed until characteristic #telangiectasias#, or superficial nests of @dilated blood vessels@, appear on the face and @bulbar conjunctiva@ at age 3-5. $#(Choice B)#  MHC class II is found on the surface of antigen-presenting cells and presents foreign protein to T-helper cells.  Defective MHC class II expression (eg, bare lymphocyte syndrome) impairs T cell immune response and activation of B cells.  Patients present in infancy with severe infections and failure to thrive.  Ataxia does not occur. $#(Choice C)#  Friedreich ataxia is due to a trinucleotide (GAA) repeat expansion affecting the mitochondrial protein Frataxin.  Mitochondrial iron transport is impaired, leading to progressive ataxia in adolescents, as well as kyphoscoliosis, cardiomyopathy, and glucose intolerance.  Immune deficiency and telangiectasias are not seen. $#(Choice D)#  Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is a disorder of purine catabolism resulting from an X-linked recessive mutation in the gene encoding hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase.  This defect leads to severe hyperuricemia and gout; patients classically also exhibit self-mutilating behavior, choreoathetoid movements, and spasticity. $#(Choice E)#  Niemann-Pick disease is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective sphingolipid degradation due to a mutation in sphingomyelinase.  Motor neuropathy (eg, hypotonia, areflexia) occurs rather than ataxia, and hepatosplenomegaly and a cherry-red macular spot are typical. $#Educational objective# Ataxia-telangiectasia is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting from defective DNA break repair.
