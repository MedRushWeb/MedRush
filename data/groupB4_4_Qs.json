In addition, although injury to the esophagus or trachea can cause pleural effusion, such injury is typically accompanied by air accumulation (eg, crepitus in the neck and/or pneumomediastinum).$(Choice B) The innominate artery is the first branch of the aortic arch, and it crosses the midtrachea from left to right (in the thorax).

To compensate for the reduced compliance, obese patients typically have increased respiratory rates with reduced tidal volumes (rapid-shallow breathing). $The most common indicator of obesity-related disease is a #reduction# in #expiratory reserve volume# (ERV), which is the maximum volume of air that can be expired after a normal tidal expiration.

Its primary mechanism of action is inhibition of the medullary cough center through #sigma (σ) receptor activation#.  Although structurally very closely related to other opioid morphinans (eg, codeine, morphine), DXM has trivial mu (μ) and delta (δ) opioid receptor affinity.  Therefore, #classic opioid adverse effects# (eg, constipation, respiratory depression, analgesia, sedation) are #not seen# at therapeutic doses.  This favorable pharmacologic profile makes DXM a first-choice agent for cough suppression. $However, DXM also increases serotonin activity in the CNS by decreasing the rate of presynaptic serotonin reuptake and directly stimulating serotonin receptors.  For this reason, DXM abuse can cause #serotonin syndrome#, manifesting as muscular hypertonia, spasticity (eg, clonus, hyperreflexia), autonomic instability (eg, hyperthermia, hypertension), and encephalopathy.  This potentially fatal condition most often occurs in settings of overdose or accidental @drug interaction@ with other serotonergic drugs (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, triptans, monoamine oxidase inhibitors). $#(Choice A)#  Although DXM has the potential for abuse, addiction is less likely than with opioid cough suppressants (eg, codeine).  Recreational drug use typically begins in peer settings, and adolescents and young adults are at greatest risk; this 39-year-old woman has no history of recreational drug use and is likely at low risk. $#(Choice C)#  DXM has no intrinsic hepatotoxicity.  However, acute liver injury can occur in overdose scenarios involving combination dextromethorphan-acetaminophen preparations (eg, multi-symptom cold remedies). $#(Choice D)#  Although it has negligible μ receptor agonism at therapeutic doses, DXM at high doses may cause intoxication that can occasionally elicit enough μ receptor agonism to produce hypoventilation and stupor.
