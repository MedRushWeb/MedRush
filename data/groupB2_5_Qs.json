Hirsute women with pathologic hyperandrogenic states (eg, #polycystic ovary syndrome#) also frequently have coexisting acne.  When acne suddenly becomes severe (eg, nodulocystic acne, @acne fulminans@), androgenic steroid supplementation should be considered as a possible cause, especially in athletes. $#(Choices A and C)#  Dairy consumption (particularly skim milk) and a high-glycemic-index diet are associated with acne.

Hyperkeratinization and obstruction of the follicle in combination with glandular enlargement and increased sebum production provides an optimal environment for Cutibacterium (Propionibacterium) acnes.  This organism metabolizes sebaceous lipids, releasing inflammatory factors that lead to follicular and perifollicular inflammation.  Acne is most common in areas with a high concentration of sebaceous follicles, including the face, back, chest, and upper arms. $#Androgens# stimulate production of sebum, and increased androgen levels (eg, puberty, polycystic ovary syndrome) increase the incidence of acne.  Obstruction of the glands, such as by #oil-based hair products# (pomade acne), also promotes acne.

Typical histologic changes include vascular abnormalities, fibroblast proliferation, and homogenization of dermal collagen (ie, fibrosis) due to the increased expression of transforming growth factor-beta.

The dermis, the connective tissue layer between the epidermis and subcutaneous tissue (ie, hypodermis), is composed of collagen, elastic fibers, and ground substance and contains extracellular components including nerves, vasculature, hair follicles, and glands.  @Neurofibromas@ are composed of a mixture of cells normally found in peripheral nerves, including #neoplastic Schwann cells#, as well as non-neoplastic fibroblasts, perineural cells, and mast cells. $Cutaneous neurofibromas most commonly appear around puberty and increase in size and number with age.  Café-au-lait macules represent localized areas of increased melanogenesis rather than pathologic cellular proliferation. $#(Choice A)#  Numerous cutaneous tumors, both benign and malignant, can arise from the adnexal structures of the skin: hair follicles (eg, pilomatricomas), sebaceous glands (eg, sebaceous adenomas), and sweat glands (eg, poromas).  Some cutaneous adnexal tumors present as skin-colored papules or nodules; however, they are typically not as diffuse as this patient's skin lesions and are not associated with numerous café-au-lait macules. $#(Choice C)#  Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is characterized by a proliferation of atypical keratinocytes arising from the epidermis and invading the dermis.  These lesions often present as discrete nodules with a @scaly@ or @ulcerated@ surface.  In contrast, this patient's multiple lesions have normal overlying epidermis.  In addition, although the epidermis contains free nerve endings, these unencapsulated neuronal receptors lack the components (eg, Schwann cells, connective tissue) that typically give rise to neurofibromas. $#(Choice D)#  Superficial fibromatosis represents an infiltrative fibroblast proliferation within superficial fascia, which can lead to progressive fascial contracture and local deformity.  A classic example is @Dupuytren contracture@ (ie, palmar fibromatosis), which affects the palmar fascia. $#(Choice E)#  Most skeletal muscle neoplasms are malignant.  @Rhabdomyosarcomas@ are aggressive tumors that arise from primitive mesenchymal cells with skeletal muscle differentiation rather than from mature, terminally differentiated muscle cells.  They often appear during childhood or adolescence and involve locations that do not contain much skeletal muscle, most commonly the sinuses and genitourinary tract. $#Educational objective# Neurofibromas are benign nerve sheath tumors composed of cells normally found in peripheral nerves, including neoplastic Schwann cells, as well as non-neoplastic fibroblasts, perineural cells, and mast cells.  Cutaneous neurofibromas often arise from small nerves in the dermis.

The hair loss occurs primarily at the temporal areas and vertex and progresses through life.  The pattern and severity vary between males and females. $Androgenetic alopecia demonstrates #polygenic inheritance# with variable expressivity.  Key sites of genetic influence have been identified on the short arm of chromosome 20, and also on the X and possibly Y chromosomes.  Therefore, some of the genetic factors may be transmitted with X-linked recessive inheritance (eg, gene variations in the androgen receptor), whereas others will show autosomal dominant inheritance #(choice A).# $#(Choice B)#  Autosomal recessive inheritance classically shows disease development in 25% of offspring from 2 asymptomatic carrier parents.  In most cases, conditions with autosomal recessive inheritance will not be seen in consecutive generations. $#(Choice C)#  Conditions passed through mitochondrial inheritance are transmitted only by the mother, and all of her offspring are affected.  Conditions transmitted by mitochondrial inheritance include a number of uncommon neuromuscular disorders. $#(Choice E)#  By definition, sporadic cases do not follow an inheritance pattern.  Sporadic cases occur haphazardly among unrelated members of a population over time.  For example, there may be a spontaneous gene mutation that causes a sporadic disorder in an individual with no family history of the disease. $#Educational objective# Androgenetic alopecia is the most common cause of hair loss in both males and females.  The pattern and severity of the baldness depend on both hormonal (circulating androgens) and genetic factors and vary between males and females.
