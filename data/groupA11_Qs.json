The murmur of right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) obstruction (ie, @pulmonic stenosis@) and evidence of right ventricular hypertrophy (ie, @boot-shaped heart@) on chest x-ray are consistent with #tetralogy of Fallot# (ToF).  The anatomic defects of @ToF@ are #RVOT obstruction# with an overriding aorta and large #ventricular septal defect# (VSD); concentric right ventricular hypertrophy develops due to increased right ventricular pressure load compared to normal. $The degree of RVOT obstruction is the major driver of symptoms in ToF because it determines how much blood flows through the pulmonary artery to the lungs and the magnitude and direction of shunting through the VSD.  Because some degree of RVOT obstruction is fixed and some degree is dynamic (ie, subject to an increase with activity [eg, crying, feeding]), many patients have left-to-right or neutral shunting through the VSD at baseline (and are acyanotic) but develop #cyanosis# when a dynamic #increase in RVOT obstruction# causes right-to-left shunting through the VSD (ie, #tet episode#). $During a @tet episode@, increased RVOT obstruction leads to #increased right ventricular pressure# and facilitates right-to-left shunting.  There is also #decreased pulmonary arterial pressure# (blood cannot pass through the RVOT tract into the pulmonary artery, reducing pulmonary blood flow), and #decreased left atrial pressure# (the left atrium receives less blood returning from the lungs).  Due to the large size of the VSD in ToF, left ventricular pressure usually closely matches right ventricular pressure (ie, the ventricles are somewhat like a single chamber). $A tet episode may be improved by bringing the knees to the chest.  This maneuver increases systemic afterload, reducing right-to-left shunting through the VSD and forcing more blood through the RVOT. $#Educational objective# The major defects in tetralogy of Fallot are right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) obstruction and a ventricular septal defect (VSD).  In many patients, activities (eg, feeding, crying) can precipitate cyanotic episodes (tet episodes) by causing a dynamic increase in RVOT obstruction.  During these episodes, increased right ventricular pressure results in right-to-left shunting through the VSD; because blood is shunted away from the pulmonary circulation, pulmonary arterial and left atrial pressures are decreased.

The development of atrial fibrillation is primarily driven by both #structural# and #electrical conduction# changes in the atrial myocardium that predispose to the initiation and maintenance of electrical reentrant circuits and/or ectopic foci: $• The structural component of atrial remodeling likely involves comorbidities that lead to chronic #atrial stretching and dilation#.  These include hypertension, heart failure, and mitral valve disease.  Physiologic age-related atrial dilation also contributes. $• The electrical conduction component likely involves age-related changes as well as previous exposure to atrial fibrillation.  During atrial fibrillation, the conduction system undergoes changes that #facilitate propagation# of the arrhythmia; over time it becomes more difficult to reverse (ie, atrial fibrillation begets atrial fibrillation). $As atrial remodeling progresses, the atria become increasingly susceptible to electrical triggers (eg, ectopic foci in pulmonary veins) that initiate fibrillation and more likely to maintain persistently disorganized electrical activity. $#(Choice A)#  An abnormal pathway in the atrioventricular node is the typical cause of @atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia@.  This arrhythmia most commonly affects young patients with an otherwise normal heart. $#(Choice C)#  Cardiac autonomic neuropathy, which can develop in patients with Parkinson disease or poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, typically leads to an impaired sympathetic cardiac response.  This often results in exercise intolerance and orthostasis but does not significantly contribute to cardiac arrhythmia. $#(Choice D)#  Conduction system fibrosis (often age-related) is a primary contributor to bradyarrhythmias, including sinus bradycardia (eg, sick sinus syndrome) and atrioventricular block. $#(Choice E)#  Enhanced sinoatrial node automaticity causes sinus tachycardia (eg, physiologic with exercise).  During atrial fibrillation, electrical signals in the sinoatrial node are suppressed by widespread disorganized electrical activity throughout the atria. $#Educational objective# Atrial remodeling is the major pathogenic contributor to atrial fibrillation.  Age and comorbidities that cause atrial dilation (eg, hypertension, heart failure, mitral valve disease) cause atrial structural changes that predispose to atrial fibrillation development.

The SaO2 in the other cardiac chambers and systemic circulation remains unchanged, and patients are often #asymptomatic# (eg, no shortness of breath, cyanosis, or clubbing). $#(Choice A)#  In @tricuspid atresia@ (absent communication between the RA and the RV), an atrial septal defect (ASD) is always present, allowing deoxygenated blood to flow from the RA to the LA.

The low-velocity blood flow through the ASD does not typically produce a murmur; the characteristic murmur of ASD, present in some patients, is a midsystolic ejection murmur resulting from increased flow across the pulmonic valve. $Right-sided volume overload eventually leads to right atrial and ventricular #enlargement#, which may be seen as an enlarged right heart contour on chest x-ray.  #Atrial fibrillation#, which is the likely cause of this patient's palpitations, is a potential complication resulting from chronic right atrial stretching. $With long-standing ASD, the chronic increase in blood flow through the pulmonary circulation induces laminated #medial hypertrophy# of the pulmonary arteries.

  "explanation_2": "$The prevalence of #severe aortic stenosis# (AS) increases with age, and definitive management necessitates surgical correction of the stenotic valve.  This often creates a complicated scenario because many #elderly patients# with severe AS have multiple other comorbidities, making them poor candidates for open surgical valve replacement due to unacceptably high operative risk.  #Transcatheter aortic valve implantation# (TAVI) provides an alternative option for such patients; the catheter is advanced through the aorta to the aortic valve where a bioprosthetic valve is placed over the native aortic valve leaflets. $This patient's intraoperative pressure readings of #decreased diastolic blood pressure# and #increased LVEDP# (left ventricular end-diastolic pressure) are consistent with #aortic regurgitation#, a common complication of TAVI that results from improper sealing of the prosthetic valve to the native valve annulus, leading to @paravalvular leak@ (blood leakage around the valve).  Inappropriate valve size or improper valve positioning is often responsible. $Other intraoperative complications of TAVI include stroke (due to embolization of native valve calcification) and myocardial infarction (due to obstruction of coronary artery ostia by the implanted valve). $#(Choice B)#  Worsening mitral stenosis can rarely occur following TAVI; such a disruption is expected to cause a decrease (rather than increase) in LVEDP due to obstructed diastolic filling. $#(Choice C)#  Prosthetic valve thrombosis usually causes valvular obstruction but may sometimes cause valvular regurgitation with similar pressure findings to this patient.  However, valvular thrombus requires time to develop and is not typically an immediate intraoperative complication. $#(Choice D)#  Retroperitoneal bleeding can result from extension of a femoral artery hematoma and is a potential complication of any catheter-based procedure with femoral arterial access.  The complication is likely to cause hemorrhagic shock with a drop in both systemic blood pressure and LVEDP. $#(Choice E)#  Ventricular septal perforation is a potential complication of TAVI but is unlikely to cause the large and abrupt increase in LVEDP that occurred in this patient.  Large perforation may eventually lead to biventricular failure and increased LVEDP, but no change or a small decrease in LVEDP is expected initially. $#Educational objective# Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) allows for minimally invasive management of severe aortic stenosis in elderly patients who are unable to tolerate open surgical valve replacement.  Paravalvular aortic regurgitation is a common complication of TAVI, resulting from improper sealing of the prosthetic valve to the native aortic valve annulus.  ",

It is detected by inflating a blood pressure cuff above systolic pressure and gradually deflating it.  The difference between the systolic pressure at which @Korotkoff sounds@ first become audible during expiration and the pressure at which they are heard throughout all phases of respiration quantifies pulsus paradoxus (20 mm Hg in this patient). $Inspiration causes an increase in systemic venous return, resulting in increased right heart volumes.  Under normal conditions, this results in expansion of the right ventricle into the pericardial space with little impact on the left side of the heart.  However, in conditions that impair expansion into the pericardial space (eg, acute cardiac tamponade), the increased right ventricular volume occurring with inspiration leads to #bowing of the interventricular septum# toward the left ventricle.  This leads to a decrease in left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic volume and stroke volume, with a resultant decrease in systolic pressure during inspiration. $#(Choice A)#  Fixed LV outflow tract obstruction (eg, valvular aortic stenosis) can cause pulsus parvus et tardus, which is palpable as a slow-rising, low-amplitude pulse due to diminished stroke volume (pulsus parvus) and prolonged LV ejection time (pulsus tardus). $#(Choice B)#  Patients with chronic severe mitral regurgitation have a bounding pulse with a brisk upstroke due to increased LV ejection volumes.  Arterial pulses are overall reduced in amplitude in patients with mitral stenosis due to reduced stroke volume. $#(Choice C)#  Myocardial ischemia or infarction can lead to decreased systemic blood pressure or hypotension due to reduced cardiac output, but it would not be expected to cause pulsus paradoxus. $#(Choice E)#  Peripheral vascular disease causes decreased pulse amplitude within the affected extremities.  This is most commonly observed in the lower extremities, which will have diminished or absent distal pulses caused by widespread peripheral arterial disease. $#Educational objective# Pulsus paradoxus is defined by a decrease in systolic blood pressure of >10 mm Hg with inspiration.

  "explanation_2": "A holosystolic murmur at the apex with radiation to the axilla is consistent with #mitral regurgitation# (MR).  The murmur is generated by regurgitant blood flow from the left ventricle back to the left atrium during systole.  This results in elevated pressure and blood volume in the left atrium, which increases the amount of blood reentering the left ventricle during diastole; an #audible S3 gallop# occurs when the left ventricle is unable to accommodate the excess blood flow. $An S3 is generated by the sudden cessation of blood flow into the left ventricle during the passive filling phase of diastole.  A higher volume of blood flow or a more dilated left ventricle is more likely to produce an S3, and although an S3 can be a normal finding in healthy young adults, it is usually a pathologic finding in older adults that is classically associated with heart failure.  In patients with MR, an S3 is the best indicator of severe MR with left-sided volume overload; the #absence of an S3# can be used to #exclude severe chronic MR#. $#(Choice B)#  An S4 is a low-frequency diastolic sound that occurs during the atrial kick of ventricular diastole, and it reflects blood colliding with a stiff ventricular wall.  It often indicates pathology such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or concentric left ventricular hypertrophy (eg, due to hypertension or aortic stenosis). $#(Choice C)#  A mid-systolic click is characteristic of mitral valve prolapse.  It is caused by sudden tensing of the chordae tendineae as they are pulled taut by the valve leaflets ballooning into the left atrium.  The @timing of the click@ varies with left ventricular volume; it occurs earlier in systole with physical maneuvers that decrease left ventricular volume. $#(Choice D)#  An opening snap is an early diastolic sound heard after S2 in patients with mitral or tricuspid stenosis.  The S2-to-opening snap interval is the time between the closure of the aortic valve and the abrupt halting of leaflet motion during opening of a stenotic mitral valve; a shorter S2-to-opening snap interval is indicative of more severe mitral stenosis. $#(Choice E)#  Pulmonic valve stenosis delays pulmonic valve closure leading to widened @splitting of S2@.  The splitting is further accentuated by the increase in venous return to the right side of the heart that occurs with inspiration. $#Educational objective# Patients with severe mitral regurgitation develop left-sided volume overload with an S3 gallop due to the large volume of regurgitant flow reentering the ventricle during mid-diastole.  The absence of an S3 gallop excludes severe chronic MR.  ",

EAC is characterized by the inability to stand or walk associated with light-headedness or #syncope# immediately following vigorous physical activity. $EAC is thought to occur due to physiologic adaptations in #endurance athletes#, who have significantly higher cardiac output than untrained individuals due to hypertrophy of the left ventricle (ie, athlete's heart).  During strenuous exercise, the skeletal muscles, particularly in the lower extremities, exert significant pressure on the venous system, which increases venous return to the heart.  When an athlete abruptly #stops exercising# (eg, finishing a run), the muscles no longer exert pressure and #venous return dramatically decreases#.  The sudden #decrease in cardiac preload# fails to meet increased cardiac demands, resulting in transient postural hypotension with syncope or collapse.  This may be compounded by inhibition of the baroreflex and dehydration, which often occur with intense exercise. $The Trendelenburg position (ie, feet inclined above the head) helps redistribute blood to the heart and brain, improving symptoms. $#(Choice B)#  The physiologic effects of exercise include increased circulating catecholamines, decreased parasympathetic activity, and increased sympathetic activation, all of which result in increased, rather than decreased, cardiac contractility. $#(Choice C)#  Left ventricular outflow obstruction (eg, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) can cause syncope and sudden cardiac death.  However, patients often have dyspnea on exertion or chest pain, and ECG abnormalities (eg, widespread repolarization changes) are typical. $#(Choice D)#  Resting bradycardia in well-conditioned athletes is thought to be due in part to an increased parasympathetic regulation of cardiac pacemaker cells.  However, because exercise training results in elevated stroke volume, this is not associated with hypotension or syncope.  Furthermore, this patient has a normal heart rate. $#(Choice E)#  Electrolyte abnormalities (eg, hyperkalemia) cause cardiac irritability and promote the development of tachyarrhythmias.  Although arrhythmias can cause collapse, they usually occur during, not immediately after, exercise.  Furthermore, electrolyte abnormalities result in characteristic ECG changes (eg, peaked T waves). $#Educational objective# Exercise-associated collapse typically occurs after intense exercise in well-conditioned athletes.

A VSD is less likely in this patient with intravenous drug use, signs of infection, and likely septic pulmonary emboli. $#(Choice E)#  Pulmonary valve IE sometimes occurs in injection drug users; however, it generally causes pulmonary valve regurgitation (not stenosis) due to incomplete valvular closure.

  "explanation_2": "$This newborn has #differential cyanosis# (or differential hypoxemia), which is cyanosis involving the lower extremities but not the upper extremities.  This pattern suggests #right-to-left shunting# of deoxygenated blood at a location distal to the branch point of the arteries supplying the head and upper extremities (ie, distal to the left subclavian artery), as can occur with shunting through the @ductus arteriosus@. $Postnatal right-to-left shunting through the ductus arteriosus occurs only with an abnormality that causes pulmonary arterial pressure to be greater than systemic arterial pressure.  One potential cause is #persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn# (PPHN), in which pulmonary vascular resistance fails to decline immediately after birth.  Flow of deoxygenated blood from the pulmonary artery to the aorta through the ductus arteriosus results in decreased postductal oxygen saturation (eg, in the lower extremities) relative to preductal oxygen saturation (eg, in the upper extremities). $With most #right-to-left shunts#, the pressure gradient across the shunt is low; therefore, the shunt itself #rarely creates a murmur# (in contrast to the continuous murmur heard with left-to-right shunting through a PDA).  The classic murmur of PPHN is a murmur of #tricuspid regurgitation# resulting from the elevated pulmonary pressure causing tricuspid valve insufficiency (ie, this patient's holosystolic murmur at the @left lower sternal border@).  This patient's strong femoral pulses are also consistent with PPHN (other causes of right-to-left shunting through the ductus arteriosus [eg, critical aortic coarctation] are associated with diminished femoral pulses). $PPHN is often triggered by a pulmonary disorder (eg, lung hypoplasia, meconium aspiration, pneumonia), which can cause respiratory distress (eg, subcostal retractions, grunting) and can also contribute to hypoxemia and cyanosis. $#(Choices A, B, and C)#  A left-to-right shunt involves passage of oxygenated blood from the systemic circulation into the pulmonary circulation.  It does not result in deoxygenated blood reaching the systemic circulation; therefore, hypoxemia and cyanosis do not occur. $#(Choice D)#  Patients with PPHN may also experience right-to-left shunting through an atrial septal defect (if present) or the foramen ovale.  However, right-to-left shunting through these intracardiac pathways would not cause differential cyanosis (ie, deoxygenated blood would reach both the upper body and the lower body). $#Educational objective# Differential cyanosis (cyanosis affecting only the lower body) suggests right-to-left shunting across the ductus arteriosus.  In newborns, a potential cause of this pattern is persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn.  ",

AAA is generally asymptomatic until aneurysm rupture, which typically presents with acute abdominal pain and hypotension; mortality of AAA rupture is 75%-90%. $Major #risk factors# for development of AAA include: $• Age >65 $• #Smoking# (up to 15-fold risk increase) $• #Male sex# $Smoking appears to be associated with increased inflammatory infiltrates and formation of reactive oxygen species (eg, superoxide anion) in the aortic wall.  In light of this, screening for AAA with ultrasonography is recommended for men age 65-75 who have ever smoked.  The risk of rupture increases with aneurysm diameter, and surgical or endovascular repair is considered for aneurysms ≥5.5 cm in diameter. $#(Choices A and E)#  Although diabetes mellitus increases the risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, the risk of AAA is lower in patients with diabetes, possibly due to the effects of glycosylation of matrix proteins in the aortic wall. $#(Choices B and C)#  Female sex is associated with a lower risk of AAA, and the benefit of screening in women (including in women who smoke) has not been shown to outweigh the risks of overdiagnosis and potential treatment complications. $#(Choice D)#  Hypertension is associated with an increased risk of aneurysm rupture, but the relation to aneurysm incidence and expansion is less clear.  Although there is a broad coincidence of AAA and atherosclerosis, studies on an epidemiologic link between hyperlipidemia and AAA are mixed. $#Educational objective# Abdominal aortic aneurysm is focal dilation of the abdominal aorta >50% above normal (or >3 cm in diameter).  It is generally asymptomatic until aneurysm rupture, which is frequently fatal.  Risk factors include age >65, smoking, and male sex.  "

Atrioventricular @reentrant tachycardia@ (AVRT), a type of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, is the most common arrhythmia that occurs with WPW.  @AVRT@ results from a rapid reentrant circuit that typically travels down the AV node to the ventricles and back up the accessory pathway, with patients often experiencing palpitations or a feeling of a racing heart. $#(Choice A)#  When in sinus rhythm, a patient with an accessory conduction pathway should have a normal P wave on ECG. $#(Choice C)#  The terminal portion of the QRS complex on ECG is typically unaffected in patients with an accessory conduction pathway. $#(Choices D and E)#  The ST segment and T wave roughly correspond to the plateau and repolarization phases of the ventricular cardiomyocyte action potential, respectively.

  "explanation_2": "$On auscultation, the best indicator of mitral stenosis (MS) severity is the length of time between S2 (specifically the A2 component, caused by aortic valve closure) and the opening snap (OS).  The OS occurs due to abrupt tensing of the valve leaflets as the mitral valve reaches its maximum diameter during forceful opening.  As MS worsens, left atrial pressures increase due to impaired movement of blood into the left ventricle.  Higher pressure causes the valve to open more forcefully; as a result, the A2-OS interval becomes shorter as left atrial pressure increases.  The current standard for diagnosis and determination of MS severity is measurement of mean transvalvular pressure gradients via 2-D Doppler echocardiography. $#(Choices B and C)#  Left-sided S3 and/or S4 gallops are generally absent in MS, since left ventricular filling is normal or decreased.  When MS is severe enough to produce pulmonary hypertension, patients may develop right-sided heart failure.  As a result, a right-sided S3 and/or S4 can occur.  However, these right-sided gallops arise only in severe, end-stage MS and are not useful for differentiating between mild and moderate MS. $#(Choice D)#  Diastolic rumble intensity in MS does not correlate well with stenosis severity.  This is due to murmur intensity being dependent on both the transvalvular pressure gradient and the amount of blood flowing through the valve.  In very severe stenosis, the diastolic murmur may be completely absent due to greatly reduced flow across the valve. $#(Choice E)#  Presystolic accentuation of the MS murmur occurs due to increased transvalvular flow associated with left atrial contraction.  This accentuation is heard across a wide range of MS severity.  More significant than the degree of presystolic accentuation is its presence or absence.  When MS becomes severe enough to precipitate atrial fibrillation, presystolic accentuation of the MS murmur disappears. $#Educational objective# The best and most reliable auscultatory indicator of the degree of mitral stenosis is the A2-OS interval.  A shorter interval indicates more severe stenosis.  Other auscultatory findings can include a diastolic rumbling murmur with presystolic accentuation due to left-atrial contraction.  "

These findings are best heard at the #cardiac apex# using the bell of the stethoscope with the patient lying on the left side in held expiration. $Left ventricular pressure falls rapidly during isovolumetric relaxation.  The opening snap is caused by the sudden opening of the mitral valve leaflets when the left ventricular diastolic pressure falls below the left atrial pressure at the beginning of diastole.

In this case, the presence of jugular venous distension and lower extremity edema shortly after pulmonary embolism (PE) are highly suggestive of #right-sided heart failure (RHF)# (ie, cor pulmonale) as the cause of this patient's ascites. $Patients with chronic respiratory disorders (eg, #emphysema#, obstructive sleep apnea) often have #baseline pulmonary hypertension# due to hypoxia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction and associated vascular remodelling, which increases the pressure that the right ventricle (RV) must work against to maintain forward flow.  These patients are #predisposed to RHF#, which can develop subacutely from progressive pulmonary hypertension or #acutely #in the setting of a PE (due to abrupt obstruction of an already compromised pulmonary capillary bed). $Ascites due to RHF is associated with the following findings: $• #Increased hydrostatic pressure:# RV dysfunction results in the backup of blood within the venous circulation, leading to increased central venous pressure, which is transmitted to the portal capillaries (ie, hepatic sinusoids). $ $• #Normal oncotic pressure:# Although passive congestion from prolonged RHF eventually causes sinusoidal injury, leading to cirrhosis and hepatic synthetic dysfunction (ie hypoalbuminemia), this alteration occurs after a prolonged period (weeks).  Albumin has a half-life of approximately 21 days; therefore, early in the disease process, oncotic pressure remains normal #(choice B).# $• #Normal capillary permeability:# Hepatic congestion is characterized by sinusoidal engorgement, but sinusoidal permeability, which is already high at baseline due to the discontinuous sinusoidal endothelium, remains essentially unchanged. $#(Choices A, D, and F)#  Portal capillary permeability may be increased in the setting of hepatic malignancies due to disruption of portal capillary integrity; however, it is unaffected by RHF.  Portal oncotic pressure remains normal early in the disease process. $#(Choice C)#  Both increased portal capillary oncotic pressure and decreased portal capillary hydrostatic pressure would help resolve ascites rather than contribute to its formation. $#Educational objective# Right-sided heart failure promotes the formation of ascites due to increased central venous pressure, which is transmitted to the hepatic sinusoids, leading to increased capillary hydrostatic pressure.  Capillary permeability is unaffected.  Although chronic passive congestion may eventually result in hepatic synthetic dysfunction (hypoalbuminemia) with low oncotic pressures, the oncotic pressure will remain normal for several weeks at least.

  "explanation_2": "This presentation of #hypotension#, tachycardia, #jugular venous distension# with clear lungs, and #pulsus paradoxus# (manifesting as loss of palpable pulse during inspiration) is consistent with #cardiac tamponade#.  This is most likely due to the patient's recent viral illness causing viral pericarditis with significant pericardial fluid accumulation.  Normally there is a <10 mm Hg decrease in systolic blood pressure during inspiration.  @Pulsus paradoxus@ refers to an abnormal exaggerated decrease in systolic blood pressure >10 mm Hg on inspiration, a common finding in patients with large pericardial effusions causing tamponade. $Inspiration causes an increase in systemic venous return, resulting in increased right heart volumes.  Under normal conditions, this results in expansion of the right ventricle into the pericardial space with little impact on the left side of the heart.  However, in conditions that impair expansion into the pericardial space (eg, cardiac tamponade), the increased right ventricular volume that occurs with inspiration leads to bowing of the interventricular septum toward the left ventricle.  This leads to a decrease in left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic volume and forward stroke volume, with a resultant decrease in systolic pressure during inspiration. $#(Choice A)#  Acute myocardial infarction typically presents with sudden onset of substernal discomfort, diaphoresis, and/or dyspnea, and can progress to cardiogenic shock (hypotension, tachycardia, jugular venous distension, and pulmonary edema).  Patients can have weak or undetectable peripheral pulses; however, pulsus paradoxus is typically not seen. $#(Choice B)#  Acute viral myocarditis can lead to severe LV systolic dysfunction and present with acute congestive heart failure and cardiogenic shock.  Patients with severe LV failure can have pulsus alternans - a variation in pulse amplitude with alternate beats.  Pulsus paradoxus is typically not seen in such patients. $#(Choice D)#  Pulsus paradoxus can also occur in patients with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and (less frequently) constrictive pericarditis.  Constrictive pericarditis is caused by scarring and loss of elasticity of the normal pericardial sac; it takes several weeks to months to develop and only rarely occurs after recurrent episodes of acute pericarditis. $#(Choice E)#  The initial stage of septic shock is a hyperdynamic circulatory state with lowered systemic vascular resistance and increased cardiac output (warm shock).  Weak pulses and pulsus paradoxus would not be expected in such patients. $#(Choice F)#  In tension pneumothorax, breath sounds are typically absent on the affected side with hyperresonance to percussion.  Other features of tension pneumothorax include tachypnea, tachycardia, hypotension, distended neck veins, and tracheal deviation to the contralateral side. $#Educational objective# Cardiac tamponade typically presents with hypotension with pulsus paradoxus, elevated jugular venous pressure, and muffled heart sounds (Beck's triad).  Pulsus paradoxus refers to an abnormal exaggerated decrease in systolic blood pressure >10 mm Hg on inspiration, and is a common finding in patients with pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade.

Venous blood normally flows from superficial veins through perforating veins into the deep veins of the extremities.

Valves located in these vessels prevent backward flow from deep to superficial veins. $Chronically elevated intraluminal pressure can lead to dilation of the veins (@varicose veins@) and #incompetence of the valves#.  This allows retrograde flow into superficial veins and results in a further increase in venous pressure.  The resulting tissue ischemia causes #venous stasis dermatitis# and is associated with poor wound healing. $Common risk factors for varicose veins and stasis dermatitis include obstruction of venous return (eg, obesity, pregnancy) and conditions that damage the venous valves (eg, deep venous thrombosis).  Prolonged standing and sedentary lifestyles are also associated with varicose veins. $#(Choice A)#  Atherosclerotic changes of the arterial intima predispose to peripheral arterial disease.

This sequence of events is consistent with #normotensive ischemia# (ie, inadequate renal perfusion despite a normal BP). $#Blood flow autoregulation# allows organs to receive the same perfusion (flow) across a wide range of pressure.  In the kidneys, blood flow autoregulation involves 2 key mechanisms: $• #Myogenic response:#  Afferent glomerular arterioles reflexively constrict when they sense greater stretch forces (high BP). $• #Tubuloglomerular feedback:#  High arterial pressure causes hyperfiltration (↑ glomerular filtration rate), increasing sodium and chloride delivery to the macula densa, which secretes vasoactive mediators (eg, adenosine) to constrict the afferent arterioles $The autoregulation response protects organs from dangerous, persistent BP elevations.  In #chronic hypertension#, there is #baseline constriction# of afferent glomerular arterioles.

However, treatment with hydralazine lowers the systemic vascular resistance, which reduces cardiac afterload.  This will lead to an increase in overall cardiac output. $#Educational objective# In patients with long-standing hypertension, a chronic autoregulatory shift in the blood pressure–flow relationship occurs, affording less perfusion (flow) at any given pressure.

  "explanation_2": "@Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)@ is a cyanotic, congenital heart defect characterized by pulmonary stenosis, an overriding aorta, right ventricular hypertrophy, and a ventricular septal defect.  When pulmonary stenosis is severe, TOF is a #ductal-dependent# lesion that relies on the patency of the #ductus arteriosus# (DA) for adequate oxygenation. $The DA is a fetal vascular structure that connects the main pulmonary artery and aorta.  @In utero@, blood (which is oxygenated by the placenta) bypasses the lungs by flowing from the pulmonary artery through the DA to the aorta.  #After birth#, the lungs fill with oxygen and @pulmonary vascular resistance@ decreases, causing the #direction of flow# through the DA to reverse (ie, from #aorta to pulmonary artery#).  DA patency is maintained by circulating prostaglandin released by the placenta; after birth, prostaglandin production stops, and the #DA starts closing#. $In severe TOF, critical pulmonary stenosis or atresia limits blood flow from the right side of the heart to the pulmonary circulation for oxygenation.  Instead, blood reaches the pulmonary vascular bed via retrograde flow from the aorta through the DA.  Without flow through the DA, affected neonates are #unable to oxygenate# blood.  These patients are #cyanotic# after birth, as in this neonate, and require immediate administration of #prostaglandin E1# to #maintain patency# of the DA. $#(Choice A)#  Heart failure medications that reduce preload (eg, diuretics) decrease left ventricular end diastolic pressure.  This decrease would not improve right ventricular outflow tract obstruction or increase retrograde blood flow through the DA in patients with TOF. $#(Choice B)#  Administration of pulmonary surfactant can improve lung compliance in preterm neonates with respiratory distress syndrome.  Because the primary pathology in TOF is cardiac rather than pulmonary, surfactant will not improve oxygenation. $#(Choice C)#  Increased pulmonary vascular resistance would worsen the pathophysiology of TOF by decreasing blood flow from the aorta through the DA into the lungs. $#(Choice E)#  Hydroxyurea increases fetal hemoglobin production, thereby improving the oxygen carrying capacity of blood in sickle cell anemia.  In TOF, oxygenation is impaired due to inadequate pulmonary blood flow from right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. $#Educational objective# Severe tetralogy of Fallot is a ductal-dependent lesion that requires blood flow through the ductus arteriosus (from the aorta to the pulmonary artery) for adequate oxygenation.  Prostaglandin E1 prevents closure of the ductus arteriosus and should be immediately administered to all cyanotic neonates with suspected ductal-dependent lesions.  ",

The decreased afterload leads to #increased LV ejection fraction# (via increased @stroke volume@); however, much of the stroke volume is lost to regurgitation into the LA, resulting in overall decreased forward stroke volume and reduced cardiac output (manifesting as #hypotension# and cardiogenic shock). $In chronic MR, compensatory LA enlargement allows the LA to receive the regurgitant volume at lower filling pressures, preventing pulmonary edema from developing.  Chronic volume overload also causes the LV to undergo substantial enlargement due to @eccentric hypertrophy@.  Early on, the larger ventricular volume helps maintain forward stroke volume even in the setting of substantial regurgitant flow.  However, with prolonged hemodynamic overload, progressive eccentric remodeling of the LV becomes maladaptive, resulting in an overwhelming increase in wall stress with eventual contractile dysfunction.  The impaired contractility culminates in decompensation of chronic MR with reduced forward stroke volume (decreased cardiac output) and increased left-sided filling pressures (pulmonary edema). $#Educational objective# Regurgitant flow into the left atrium in acute mitral regurgitation leads to increased left atrial pressure and increased left ventricular end-diastolic volume (preload).  The low-resistance regurgitant pathway also decreases left ventricular afterload with a resulting increase in ejection fraction but overall decrease in forward stroke volume.  Increased left atrial pressure and decreased cardiac output result in pulmonary edema and severe hypotension, respectively.  ",

These changes both benefit the fetus and protect the patient against the risks of delivery (eg, hemorrhage). $The driving force behind maternal hemodynamic changes is a significant #decrease in systemic vascular resistance# (SVR) due to both increased release of peripheral vasodilators (eg, nitric oxide, prostacyclin) and formation of a high-flow, low-resistance uteroplacental circuit (increases blood flow to the placenta and fetus).

The maximum pressure difference between the left ventricular and aortic pressure tracings is noted at point B and corresponds to the peak intensity of a cardiac murmur during auscultation. $#(Choices A and C)#  The murmur of AS is a systolic ejection-type crescendo-decrescendo murmur that starts after the first heart sound following the opening of the aortic valve (point A).  It typically ends before the A2 component of the second heart sound (point C).  At points A and C, the left ventricular and aortic pressures are nearly equal with no or minimal flow across the aortic valve, and the murmur of AS would not be appreciated. $#(Choices D and E)#  These points occur during diastole, when the aortic valve is closed and the mitral valve is open.  There is no abnormally elevated pressure gradient between the left atrium and left ventricle.  This is consistent with normal, unobstructed diastolic filling of the left ventricle, and no murmur would be heard during diastole. $#Educational objective# The murmur of aortic stenosis (AS) is a systolic ejection-type, crescendo-decrescendo murmur that starts after the first heart sound and typically ends before the A2 component of the second heart sound.  The intensity of the murmur is proportional to the magnitude of the left ventricle to aorta pressure gradient during systole.  ",

Atheroembolic disease typically occurs after an #invasive vascular procedure# (eg, coronary angiography, aortic surgery) in which atherosclerotic plaques on large vessels (eg, aorta) are mechanically dislodged.  This leads to showering of cholesterol-rich microemboli into the circulation with resultant obstruction of distal arterioles and tissue ischemia. $Clinical manifestations depend on the location of the embolic scatter.  Patients frequently #develop acute kidney injury# due to partial or complete occlusion of the arcuate or interlobular arteries.  Other commonly involved organ systems include the skin (eg, blue toe syndrome, livedo reticularis), the gastrointestinal tract (eg, bleeding; intestinal infarction, as in this patient), and the CNS (eg, stroke, amaurosis fugax). $#(Choice B)#  Heparin anticoagulants given during angiography can cause heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), which typically presents with low platelet counts and thrombotic complications.  However, the destruction of platelets in HIT is due to immune-mediated platelet aggregation, rather than bone marrow suppression. $#(Choice C)#  Gout causes needle-shaped crystals seen on microscopy.  However, uric acid crystals are negatively birefringent (not empty clefts) and are located within tophi or synovial fluid.  In addition, gout does not cause embolic disease. $#(Choice D)#  Pulmonary infarction can also occur in atheroembolic disease; however, this is an extremely rare manifestation and occurs much less commonly than acute kidney injury. $#(Choice E)#  Infectious endocarditis also causes embolic showering and can cause both small bowel involvement and septic arthritis.  However, endocarditis is more common in drug users, and patients typically develop fever, arthralgias, and night sweats.  In addition, bacteria, not cholesterol clefts, would be visualized on microscopic examination. $#Educational objective# Atheroembolic disease typically occurs after an invasive vascular procedure due to mechanical dislodgement of atherosclerotic plaque, resulting in the showering of cholesterol-rich microemboli into the circulation.  Needle-shaped cholesterol clefts in affected vessels are diagnostic.  Commonly involved organs include the kidneys (eg, acute kidney injury), skin (eg, blue toe syndrome, livedo reticularis), gastrointestinal tract (eg, bleeding, infarction), and CNS (eg, stroke, amaurosis fugax).

Heart failure occurs due to either a progressive decline in myocardial contractility (systolic dysfunction) or impaired ability of the ventricular walls to relax during filling (diastolic dysfunction).  Both etiologies eventually lead to #decreased cardiac output# and inadequate oxygen delivery to the tissues, inducing the following #neuroendocrine compensatory mechanisms# in an effort to restore organ perfusion: $• #Increased sympathetic output#:  Baroreceptors sense decreased perfusion and stimulate epinephrine and norepinephrine release to increase heart rate and contractility.  Vasoconstriction is also triggered, #increasing arteriolar resistance# and raising afterload. $• #Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) activation#:  Decreased renal perfusion #(choice D)# leads to increased secretion of @renin@ and increased circulating levels of angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor that further increases afterload.  Adrenal secretion of aldosterone also increases, which stimulates sodium and water retention and increases circulating blood volume (preload). $Although these compensatory mechanisms initially improve organ perfusion, they are overall #maladaptive#.  A vicious cycle is generated as the failing heart is unable to pump against increased afterload, and volume retention creates venous congestion in the kidneys that reduces glomerular filtration rate and further impairs diuresis.  Atrial and ventricular stretch triggers the release of natriuretic peptides that stimulate vasodilation and fluid diuresis to counteract the vicious cycle; however, these effects are outweighed by the downward-spiraling negative effects of sympathetic drive and RAAS activation. $#(Choice B)#  Left ventricular failure leads to increased pulmonary venous pressure and transudation of fluid into the lung parenchyma, which stiffens the alveolar walls and decreases lung compliance. $#(Choice C)#  With reduced cardiac output, the tissues become starved for O2 and increase O2 extraction from the available capillary blood.  This leads to a reduction in mixed venous O2 content. $#(Choice E)#  Stroke volume is generally maintained early in heart failure (due to compensatory mechanisms) and decreases as decompensation takes place. $#Educational objective# Decreased cardiac output in heart failure triggers neuroendocrine compensatory mechanisms to maintain organ perfusion; however, the compensatory mechanisms are maladaptive over the long term.  Increased sympathetic output and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system stimulate vasoconstriction and volume retention, compounding the hemodynamic stress on an already failing heart and creating a vicious cycle of decompensation.

A number of viruses have been implicated in causing DCM including coxsackievirus, adenovirus, and influenza virus.

In the cardiac cycle, passive filling of the left atrium with blood from the pulmonary veins (atrial diastole) occurs essentially in sync with left ventricular (LV) systole.  Left atrial pressure gradually increases to approximately 10 mm Hg in the normal heart with a characteristic \"V wave\" created at the end of passive filling.  However, in the setting of MR, an incompetent mitral valve allows backflow of blood from the left ventricle during ventricular systole, leading to markedly #elevated left atrial pressure# during this time.  This creates an #early and large V wave#, the characteristic pressure tracing finding in patients with MR. $The elevated left atrial pressure in MR leads to atrial dilation and often precipitates atrial fibrillation, symptomatically manifesting with palpitations.  Over time, decompensated heart failure, evidenced by dyspnea and orthopnea in this patient, can also occur. $#(Choice A)#  In @aortic regurgitation@, backflow of blood from the aorta into the left ventricle during diastole results in rapid loss of aortic pressure and elevated LV end-diastolic volume with a compensatory increase in LV stroke volume.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient's sudden-onset heart failure was most likely precipitated by acute #atrial fibrillation#, a condition that occurs in up to 10% of patients with #severe aortic stenosis# (AS).  Patients with severe AS already have reduced cardiac output due to significant valvular obstruction, which can be exacerbated by the sudden #loss of normal atrial contraction# that contributes to ventricular filling.  Atrial contraction is especially important for these patients as many have concentric left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and therefore reduced LV compliance.  As a result, they become dependent on atrial contraction to maintain adequate LV filling.  Without atrial contraction, LV preload can decrease to the point of producing severe #hypotension#.  In addition, loss of the atrial kick can result in significantly increased mean pulmonary venous pressure due to buildup of blood in the left atrium and pulmonary veins, leading to #acute pulmonary edema#.  As a result, cardioversion is indicated for acute atrial fibrillation in patients with severe AS. $#(Choice A)#  Cardiogenic pulmonary edema is characteristic of left, not right, heart failure.  When the forward pumping function of the left heart is impaired, pressure can build up in the left atrium.  This rise in pressure is transmitted to the pulmonary veins and capillaries, resulting in increased fluid transudation into the alveoli and pulmonary interstitium. $#(Choices C and E)#  This patient has no evidence of myocardial ischemia on electrocardiogram, meaning that LV systolic function is most likely unchanged.  Under these circumstances, an increase in LV filling (preload) would increase cardiac output and mean arterial pressure due to the Frank-Starling mechanism.  This patient's decreased cardiac output is most likely due to decreased LV preload. $#(Choice D)#  In a patient with AS, LV afterload is determined by the mean systolic blood pressure and the degree of transvalvular obstruction.  In degenerative calcific AS and most other forms of adult AS, the transvalvular obstruction gradually increases over years to decades, making an acute increase in LV afterload unlikely.  In addition, this patient's acute hypotension would actually cause a reduction in afterload. $#Educational objective# In patients with chronic aortic stenosis and concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, atrial contraction contributes significantly to left ventricular filling.  Loss of atrial contraction due to atrial fibrillation can reduce left ventricular preload and cardiac output sufficiently to cause systemic hypotension.  Decreased forward filling of the left ventricle can also result in backup of blood in the left atrium and pulmonary veins, leading to acute pulmonary edema.  "

Tamponade classically presents with #Beck's triad# of hypotension (often less prominent with subacute compared to acute tamponade), distant heart sounds, and jugular venous distension. $Normally, a pressure gradient exists between the vena cava and the right side of the heart, allowing blood to fill the right atrium during diastole.  With inspiration, a reduction in intrathoracic pressure pulls additional blood into the right side of the heart and the pulmonary circulation, causing normal inspiratory collapse of the inferior vena cava (IVC). $With cardiac tamponade, increasing pericardial pressure begins to compress the relatively low-pressure, #right-sided heart chambers# and #restrict diastolic filling#.  The increased right-sided pressures are transmitted backward to the vena cava, causing #engorgement of the IVC# with decreased inspiratory collapse that can be seen on echocardiography.  In addition, because the right ventricle is compressed and unable to expand during diastole, the increase in right-sided blood flow during inspiration causes the ventricular septum to bow into the left ventricle; this reduces left ventricular stroke volume during inspiration and is responsible for the observed >10 mm Hg drop in systolic blood pressure. $As tamponade progresses, impaired right-sided filling causes the left ventricle to receive less blood, resulting in decreased cardiac output and #obstructive shock#.  Because the obstruction to blood flow is primarily right sided, there is no pulmonary edema and the lungs remain clear to auscultation. $#(Choices A, B, D, and E)#  A segmental (eg, apical) wall motion abnormality suggests myocardial ischemia or infarction, dilation of all 4 cardiac chambers is seen with dilated cardiomyopathy, severe tricuspid regurgitation can occur with carcinoid syndrome, and systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve is seen with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (and often exacerbates obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract).

  "explanation_2": "$The major early biochemical consequence of total myocardial ischemia is cessation of aerobic glycolysis and initiation of anaerobic glycolysis.  This transition occurs within seconds and results in inadequate production of high-energy phosphates (eg, ATP and creatine phosphate) and the accumulation of deleterious metabolites, including lactate.  Although total ATP levels remain relatively normal during the first few minutes of ischemia, ATP is rapidly depleted from areas of the cell with high metabolic demand, such as the cytosol surrounding the contraction fibers and electrolyte transport pumps.  The depletion of ATP in critical cellular areas and the accumulation of toxins result in loss of contractility within about 60 seconds of total myocardial ischemia #(choice A).# $As ischemia persists, ATP levels within the affected cardiac myocytes continue to fall while lactate levels continue to rise.  When ischemia lasts less than 30 minutes, loss of contractile function is reversible.  However, on restoration of blood flow, full myocardial contractility is not immediately restored.  Instead, there is prolonged dysfunction of the myocardium (myocardial stunning), with contractility gradually returning to normal over the next several hours to days.  Increasing durations of ischemia prolong the time that the myocardium remains stunned. $Under hypoxic conditions, ATP within cardiomyocytes is degraded to ADP, AMP, and eventually adenosine.  Adenosine is able to cross the cell membrane and function as a vasodilator when coronary blood flow is insufficient to meet myocardial demand.  However, persistent ischemia can lead to depletion of massive amounts of adenosine.  After 30 minutes of total myocardial ischemia, about half of the cellular adenine stores are lost.  At this point, failure of cellular homeostasis is inevitable and ischemic injury becomes irreversible #(choice E).# $#Educational objective# Loss of cardiomyocyte contractility occurs within 60 seconds after the onset of total ischemia.  When ischemia lasts less than 30 minutes, restoration of blood flow leads to reversible contractile dysfunction (myocardial stunning), with contractility gradually returning to normal over the next several hours to days.  However, after about 30 minutes of total ischemia, ischemic injury becomes irreversible.  "

In addition, her #hypotension# in the setting of infection suggests #septic shock#.  Septic shock is the most common type of distributive shock; other types include anaphylactic shock and neurogenic shock. $The primary disturbance in @septic shock@ is #widespread vasodilation# leading to #decreased systemic vascular resistance# (SVR).  Increased vascular permeability (third-spacing) and peripheral venous dilation also cause a reduction in central venous pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) #(choice B).#  Initially, the hypotension and inflammation from sepsis trigger a compensatory increase in sympathetic drive that increases heart rate and myocardial contractility, leading to #increased cardiac index# (cardiac output per body surface area).  The high blood flow rates prevent complete extraction of oxygen by the tissues, resulting in #high mixed venous oxygen saturation#.  As shock progresses, tissue ischemia and accumulation of cytotoxic mediators eventually cause a reduction in cardiac output with end-organ dysfunction. $#(Choice A)#  Low cardiac index with high PCWP is consistent with @cardiogenic shock@.  The primary disturbance is typically left ventricular failure with a compensatory increase in SVR in an effort to maintain adequate blood pressure for organ perfusion. $#(Choice C)#  Low PCWP with low cardiac index and high SVR occurs in both @hypovolemic shock@ and some types of @obstructive shock@ (eg, pulmonary embolism, tension pneumothorax).  Central venous pressure is low in hypovolemic shock and high in obstructive shock. $#(Choice D)#  Low PCWP with low cardiac index and low SVR occurs in neurogenic shock.  As in sepsis, the primary disturbance is peripheral vasodilation.  However, due to nerve injury there is no sympathetic-mediated increase in heart rate and myocardial contractility; therefore, cardiac output is low.  These parameters are also seen in the late stages of septic shock; however, this patient's flushing is consistent with the high cardiac output seen in early septic shock. $#Educational objective# Septic shock causes widespread arteriolar vasodilation, which leads to a decrease in systemic vascular resistance and a compensatory increase in cardiac output.  Central venous pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure are also decreased due to pooling of blood in the dilated veins.  Increased flow rates through the peripheral capillaries lead to incomplete oxygen extraction by the tissues and high mixed venous oxygen saturation.  ",

These findings are consistent with #paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia# (PSVT), an episodic cardiac arrhythmia that originates @at or above@ the atrioventricular (AV) node.  The most common type of PSVT is @AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT)@, which usually affects #young patients# (eg, age <40) with an otherwise normal heart. $Patients with AVNRT have #2 distinct# AV nodal conduction pathways: a #fast pathway# with a long refractory period and a #slow pathway# with a short refractory period.  During normal conduction, an impulse from the atria travels down both the fast and slow pathways, and the impulse from the slow pathway is blocked by the long refractory period of the fast pathway, allowing organized conduction of one impulse to the ventricles.  On occasion, an impulse from the atria (eg, premature atrial contraction) occurs while the fast pathway is still refractory, traveling down only the slow pathway.  If the fast pathway is no longer refractory by the time the impulse reaches the bottom of the slow pathway, the impulse may travel back up the fast pathway, creating a #reentrant circuit# with rapid conduction of impulses to the ventricles. $On ECG, retrograde conduction up the fast pathway creates a #retrograde P wave#; however, because this conduction is usually simultaneous with anterograde conduction to the ventricles, the #P wave is often buried within the QRS complex# and is not visible. $#(Choice A)#  Abnormal conduction in areas of ischemic ventricular scarring is a common cause of @monomorphic ventricular tachycardia@.

The QRS complexes are narrow. $#(Choice D)#  Degeneration of the sinoatrial node can lead to @sick sinus syndrome@, usually in patients age >65.  ECG can show sinus bradycardia with sinus pauses and sinus arrest.  Patients may sometimes develop episodes of @sinus tachycardia@, which can appear similar to PSVT but with normal P waves present. $#(Choice E)#  Delayed repolarization of ventricular cardiomyocytes can lead to @torsade de pointes@, a form of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia.  ECG shows wide QRS complexes that oscillate in height and position. $#Educational objective# Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia is the most common type of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, resulting from abnormal conduction through 2 distinct atrioventricular nodal pathways.

  "explanation_2": "$The changes in this newborn's heart murmur throughout the first day of life are most likely explained by the normal evolution of the #ductus arteriosus#. $In the @fetal circulation@, blood flows right to left through the ductus arteriosus from the pulmonary artery to the aorta, bypassing the lungs.  This occurs due to high pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) caused by the constricted pulmonary arteries and low systemic vascular resistance (SVR) caused by the low resistance of the placenta. $#After delivery#, increased oxygen tension in the lungs causes pulmonary vasodilation and #reduced PVR#.  At the same time, the placenta becomes disconnected from the newborn's systemic circulation, leading to #increased SVR#.  These changes decrease pulmonary pressure and increase systemic pressure, reversing right-to-left blood flow through the ductus arteriosus to @left-to-right blood flow@. $Just after birth, pulmonary diastolic pressure is still high relative to systemic diastolic pressure, so the murmur is heard best (or only) during systole.  As PVR continues to fall, systemic pressure exceeds pulmonary pressure throughout the cardiac cycle, and the classic machinery-like, #continuous murmur# is heard best at the left upper sternal border or left infraclavicular area.  When the ductus arteriosus closes (usually 24-48 hr after birth), the murmur disappears. $#(Choice A)#  Left-to-right flow through a ventricular septal defect (VSD) causes a holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border; this murmur does not have a diastolic component. $#(Choices B, D, and F)#  Incomplete closure of the ductus arteriosus causes a patent ductus arteriosus.  Long-standing left-to-right shunting through a patent ductus arteriosus (or atrial/ventricular septal defects) can lead to pulmonary vascular remodeling with gradually increased PVR and eventual reversal to right-to-left shunting (ie, Eisenmenger syndrome).  However, right-to-left shunting usually causes cyanosis (not noted in this patient), and the pressure gradient is not typically large enough to cause a murmur. $#(Choice E)#  Left-to-right flow through an ASD itself does not generate a murmur due to the low velocity of shunted blood.  The characteristic murmur of an ASD is a systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border caused by increased flow through the pulmonic valve.  However, this murmur does not have a diastolic component (ie, not continuous). $#Educational objective# After birth, pulmonary vascular resistance progressively decreases as systemic vascular resistance progressively increases.  As the relative pressures in the pulmonary artery and aorta change, the murmur associated with the ductus arteriosus evolves from systolic only to continuous before the duct closes, at which time the murmur disappears.

Sick sinus syndrome most commonly results from #age-related degeneration# of the #sinoatrial node#, which is located on the @right atrial wall@ and is responsible for initiating normal cardiac conduction.  Impaired signaling from the sinoatrial node can markedly slow the rate of ventricular contraction, leading to #reduced cardiac output# and symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, lightheadedness, presyncope, and syncope. $Typical ECG findings include bradycardia, #sinus pauses# (delayed P waves), and #sinus arrest# (prolonged delay of a P wave such that the P wave is dropped).  Because the atrioventricular node triggers conduction based on its own pacemaker if it does not receive a timely signal from the sinoatrial node, sinus arrest will lead to a #junctional escape beat# (narrow QRS complex preceded by a long pause and no P wave).  Sick sinus syndrome can also cause brief periods of atrial tachycardia (eg, atrial fibrillation) alternating with bradycardia. $#(Choice A)#  The inferior portion of the interatrial septum contains the His bundle.  Conduction abnormalities in this region can manifest as varying degrees of atrioventricular block with prolongation of the PR interval (first degree), dropped QRS complexes (second degree), or dissociation of P waves and QRS complexes (third degree). $#(Choice B)#  Conduction through the interventricular septum mostly involves the left and right bundle branches.  Conduction abnormalities in this region can lead to bundle branch blocks; the QRS complex is widened in @bundle branch block@ due to impaired synchronization of ventricular depolarization. $#(Choice C)#  After initiation in the sinoatrial node, conduction propagates through the cardiomyocytes of the left atrial wall to stimulate left atrial contraction.  Abnormal electrical foci can develop in the nearby pulmonary veins, which is a common trigger for @atrial fibrillation@. $#(Choice D)#  Conduction abnormalities may originate in ischemic areas of the left ventricular free wall, leading to @ventricular tachycardia@. $#Educational objective# Sick sinus syndrome results from degeneration (usually age-related) of the sinoatrial node, leading to impaired conduction and reduced cardiac output with symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, lightheadedness, presyncope, and syncope.  ECG typically demonstrates bradycardia with sinus pauses (delayed P waves), sinus arrest (dropped P waves), and junctional escape beats.  ",

  "explanation_2": "This patient has a number of clinical findings that are characteristic of #chronic aortic regurgitation# (AR).  Failure of the aortic valve to tightly seal off the aorta from the left ventricle at the end of systole leads to rapid loss of aortic pressure and an overall #decrease in diastolic blood pressure#.  In addition, the left ventricle undergoes @eccentric hypertrophy@ to initially compensate for an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic volume, which leads to increased stroke volume and cardiac output.  Because pulse pressure (the difference between diastolic and systolic blood pressure) is proportional to stroke volume, the compensatory #increased stroke volume# on top of reduced diastolic pressure causes the characteristic #widened pulse pressure# seen with AR. $This high-amplitude pulsation with rapid diastolic collapse is responsible for the unusual pulsation findings in AR.

In addition, physical examination can show abrupt distension and collapse of the carotid arteries (Corrigan sign) and peripheral arteries (\"water-hammer\" pulse), and reveal \"pistol-shot\" femoral pulses (Traube sign) on auscultation. $#(Choice A)#  Impaired left ventricular contractility occurs later in the course of AR and eventually leads to heart failure.  Because head-bobbing and other characteristic findings in AR are due to increased stroke volume and high-amplitude, rapid rise-rapid fall pulsation, these findings are less prominent once impaired left ventricular contractility (and decreased stroke volume) sets in. $#(Choices B and C)#  Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, such as occurs with aortic stenosis, leads to reduced stroke volume and characteristic weak and delayed pulses (pulsus parvus et tardus).  Restriction of left ventricular filling, as occurs in mitral stenosis, also reduces stroke volume due to reduced left ventricular end-diastolic volume (reduced preload).  Clinical findings associated with high-amplitude pulsation will not be present with reduced stroke volume. $#(Choice D)#  Combined systolic and diastolic hypertension is not necessarily accompanied by widened pulse pressure; the signs of high amplitude, rapid rise-rapid fall pulsation are more characteristic of chronic AR. $#Educational objective# Chronic aortic regurgitation (AR) causes a reduction in diastolic blood pressure and a compensatory increase in left ventricular stroke volume.

Infants may become altered (eg, lethargic, poor feeding) and develop signs of heart failure (eg, tachypnea, crackles, hepatomegaly). $#(Choice A)#  Decreased effective intravascular volume is the mechanism for hypotension associated with hypovolemic shock.  This patient has normal capillary refill without a history of volume depletion (eg, diarrhea, vomiting, blood loss). $#(Choice B)#  Hypotension due to decreased myocardial contractility is seen with a myocardial infarction, which is extremely rare in infancy, or a viral-induced cardiomyopathy, which is unlikely in the absence of infectious symptoms (eg, fever, rhinorrhea). $#(Choice C)#  Low cardiac output associated with SVT would lead to a compensatory increase, not a decrease, in peripheral vascular resistance. $#(Choice D)#  A large left-to-right intracardiac shunt (eg, ventricular septal defect [VSD]) can cause hypotension and tachycardia, but signs of heart failure (eg, crackles, hepatomegaly) would be expected.  In addition, depending on the size of VSD, ECG may show left or biventricular hypertrophy, not narrow QRS complexes with absent P waves. $#Educational objective# Supraventricular tachycardia is characterized by an elevated heart rate with a regular rhythm and narrow QRS complexes due to an abnormal electrical impulse originating above the ventricles.  Sustained tachycardia shortens ventricular diastole, leading to decreased stroke volume and cardiac output and subsequent hypotension.  ",

  "explanation_2": "This patient with recurrent episodes of #syncope while shaving# most likely has #carotid sinus hypersensitivity# (CSH).  When @carotid sinus baroreceptors@ detect increased blood pressure, the brainstem responds by increasing parasympathetic tone (slows the heart rate) and reducing sympathetic tone (induces vasodilation).  In some individuals, especially #elderly men#, the carotid sinus baroreceptors become #overly sensitive to tactile stimulation#, triggering an #exaggerated vasovagal response# with marked peripheral vasodilation (ie, #decreased systemic vascular resistance#).  This can cause a transient reduction in cerebral perfusion that manifests as presyncope (eg, faintness, lightheadedness) or syncope.  As with other etiologies of syncope, cerebral perfusion quickly returns and symptoms resolve within 1-2 minutes. $In addition to shaving, rubbing of a shirt collar while dressing or turning the head is another common cause of syncope due to CSH. $#(Choices A and E)#  Cardiac tachyarrhythmias are a serious cause of syncope due to reduced cardiac output and loss of cerebral perfusion.  Spontaneous resolution of the arrhythmia within 1-2 minutes allows for return of cerebral perfusion (if spontaneous resolution does not occur, the arrhythmia may cause sudden death rather than syncope).  Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia rarely causes syncope as it usually affects young patients who can tolerate rapid heart rates.  Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (torsade de pointes) typically results from delayed ventricular repolarization (ie, congenital or medication-induced QT interval prolongation) and can cause syncope in patients of any age.  Syncope due to tachyarrhythmia usually occurs suddenly with no warning symptoms (eg, faintness, lightheadedness) other than sometimes palpitations. $#(Choice C)#  Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) obstructs pulmonary blood flow and increases pulmonary vascular resistance.  Some cases of acute PE present with syncope, but acute PE is unlikely to explain recurrent episodes of syncope.  In addition, chronic pulmonary hypertension typically presents with exertional symptoms. $#(Choice D)#  The exaggerated vagal response in reflex syncope causes transient sinus bradycardia, PR interval prolongation, and atrioventricular (AV) node conduction block, whereas syncope due to age-related degeneration of the AV node usually involves sustained and advanced AV block (eg, third-degree, Mobitz type II second-degree).  This patient's recurrent episodes during shaving make reflex syncope due to CSH more likely. $#Educational objective# Carotid sinus hypersensitivity is a common cause of syncope associated with tactile stimulation of the carotid sinus (eg, shaving).  The syncope results from an exaggerated vagal response stimulated by the carotid baroreceptors, which leads to slowed heart rate and marked peripheral vasodilation with a resulting transient loss of cerebral perfusion.

The condition likely results from hyperreactivity of arterial smooth muscle due to a combination of #endothelial dysfunction# and #autonomic imbalance#. $The major underlying defect in vasospastic angina is likely a deficiency of vasodilatory nitric oxide in the coronary artery endothelium, causing acetylcholine released from vagus nerve terminals to trigger vasoconstriction rather than vasodilation.  Patients typically experience episodes of #recurrent chest discomfort# that spontaneously #resolve within 15 minutes#.  The episodes often occur at rest or #during sleep#, when vagal tone is at a peak.  As with typical angina, there may be associated diaphoresis, nausea, and dyspnea, but unlike typical angina, patients are usually young (age <50) and lack most risk factors for atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD) (eg, hypertension, diabetes).  However, smoking is a strong risk factor, likely due to its contribution to endothelial dysfunction. $Vasospastic angina is usually diagnosed by ambulatory ECG (Holter monitor) that shows #ST elevation# during an episode of chest discomfort, followed by coronary angiography to rule out atherosclerotic CAD.  Sublingual nitroglycerin is effective in relieving an active episode of vasospastic angina, and calcium channel blockers (eg, diltiazem, amlodipine) are effective in preventing episodes. $#(Choices A and D)#  Endothelin-1 is a potent vasoconstrictor and prostacyclin is a vasodilator.  Therefore, decreased expression of endothelin-1 or increased expression of prostacyclin would stimulate coronary vasodilation rather than vasospasm. $#(Choice B)#  Granulomatous inflammation of arterial media occurs in Takayasu arteritis, a large-vessel vasculitis affecting the aorta and its major branches.  Young women of Asian descent are most commonly affected and sometimes develop angina due to coronary artery involvement; however, limb claudication (due to subclavian artery involvement) accompanied by constitutional symptoms (eg, fever, fatigue) is a more common presentation. $#(Choice E)#  Ulceration of the thin fibrous cap overlying an atherosclerotic plaque can lead to unstable angina, characterized by intermittent chest discomfort similar to that of vasospastic angina.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient has dyspnea, signs of lung hyperinflation, and a heavy smoking history, suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  Chronic hypoxia in COPD can lead to pulmonary vasoconstriction, increased pulmonary artery pressure, and right heart failure (ie, cor pulmonale), which is confirmed by this patient's echocardiogram.  In turn, right heart failure leads to increased central venous pressure and elevated peripheral capillary hydrostatic pressure, encouraging the development of #peripheral edema#. $Fluid movement across the capillary wall (#filtration#) into the interstitium is dependent on hydrostatic pressure, oncotic pressure, and capillary permeability.  It is tightly #balanced by lymphatic drainage#, which returns interstitial fluid to the vasculature.  Peripheral edema (accumulation of excess fluid in the interstitial space) develops when transcapillary plasma filtration exceeds the resorptive capacity of the lymphatics.  Factors that favor development of edema include: $• #Elevated capillary hydrostatic pressure:#  Higher capillary pressures increase plasma filtration into the interstitium, particularly in dependent tissues.  Causes include sodium and water retention (eg, heart failure, renal failure), arteriolar dilation (eg, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers), and impaired venous return (eg, venous thrombosis). $• #Decreased plasma oncotic pressure:#  Plasma proteins (eg, albumin) generate oncotic pressure that pulls interstitial fluid back into the capillary bed venules.  Edema develops in conditions with decreased albumin levels (eg, nephrotic syndrome, cirrhosis, malnutrition). $• #Lymphatic obstruction:#  Decreased lymphatic return impairs removal of excess interstitial fluid.  Common causes of lymphatic obstruction include filariasis, invasive malignancies, and iatrogenic etiologies (eg, surgical lymph node dissection and radiation therapy). $The peripheral lymphatics can significantly increase lymphatic drainage from baseline, allowing compensation for increased capillary fluid filtration that can #temporarily delay# the development of peripheral edema.  However, because the peripheral lymphatics offload fluid to the central venous system (via the thoracic duct), which in heart failure is already volume overloaded, the overall ability to compensate is limited. $#(Choices A and D)#  Although increased plasma oncotic pressure and decreased capillary permeability oppose edema formation, neither is associated with COPD.  Severe COPD may cause polycythemia due to hypoxemia, but erythrocyte concentration does not affect plasma oncotic pressure. $#(Choice B)#  In patients with heart failure, activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) leads to increased aldosterone levels that cause sodium and water retention (exacerbating edema formation).  Volume expansion causes increased atrial/brain natriuretic peptide release, which can partially counteract the effects of RAAS activation; however, aldosterone levels remain elevated. $#(Choice C)#  Decreased interstitial fluid pressure favors flow into the interstitium and would contribute to the development of peripheral edema. $#Educational objective# Peripheral edema results from the accumulation of fluid in the interstitial spaces.  Factors that promote edema include elevated capillary hydrostatic pressure, decreased plasma oncotic pressure, and impaired lymphatic drainage.  In chronic heart failure, increased lymphatic drainage initially offsets factors favoring edema, temporarily delaying edema development.  "

The thickened LV walls become stiff and less compliant, leading to impaired diastolic relaxation and #increased LV end-diastolic pressure# (point 1).  Gradually, the elevated pressure transmits back to the pulmonary veins and capillaries, resulting in pulmonary edema.  There is also an eventual decline in LV end-diastolic volume (also indicated at point 1) leading to #reduced cardiac output# and further decompensation (stroke volume decreases despite preserved ejection fraction). $#(Choice A)#  The decreased cardiac output in heart failure leads to reduced renal perfusion pressure and glomerular hypofiltration.  To compensate, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is activated, and angiotensin II constricts glomerular efferent arterioles in an effort to increase glomerular filtration rate back to normal. $#(Choice C)#  Diastolic dysfunction involves a decrease in LV compliance.  LV compliance may increase with eccentric hypertrophy, as occurs in response to LV volume overload (eg, dilated cardiomyopathy). $#(Choice D)#  LV thrombus typically results from localized stagnation of blood as can occur with an LV aneurysm or in the setting of a severely dilated LV cavity with @systolic dysfunction@.  It is not typically associated with diastolic dysfunction and HFpEF. $#(Choice E)#  Atrial and ventricular septal defects are often asymptomatic but can eventually lead to right-to-left intracardiac shunting (Eisenmenger syndrome), typically characterized by cyanosis.  This patient's orthopnea, lower extremity edema, and bibasilar crackles suggesting pulmonary edema are more consistent with heart failure. $#Educational objective# Diastolic dysfunction is a common cause of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.

This allows for a #large capacity to increase oxygen extraction# during periods of ischemia. $• The relatively low systolic pressure of the RV (eg, ≤25 mm Hg) allows for #coronary perfusion throughout the cardiac cycle#; during MI, this enables the RV to pull blood flow from collateral vessels during both systole and diastole.  In contrast, the high systolic pressure of the LV (eg, 120 mm Hg) blocks coronary blood flow of the LV walls during systole, allowing for perfusion @during diastole@ only. $These factors likely contribute to the typical clinical course of MI involving the RV, which is acute RV contractile dysfunction often leading to profound hypotension and hemodynamic instability; acute mortality risk is high, but there is minimal long-term RV dysfunction for those who survive. $#(Choice A)#  The large muscle mass of the LV necessitates higher oxygen extraction at rest, with relatively little capacity to increase oxygen extraction during periods of ischemia. $#(Choice B)#  The most robust collateral flow occurs from the left to the right coronary arteries, suggesting the RV has a more developed collateral circulation and may be more dependent on collateral flow than the LV. $#(Choice C)#  Ischemic preconditioning refers to the myocardium being repeatedly exposed to mildly ischemic states (eg, during periods of exercise), which stimulates adjustments (eg, collateral circulation development, cellular improvements in oxygen utilization) that allow future ischemic states to be better tolerated.  The RV is thought to experience heightened ischemic preconditioning compared to the LV, contributing to protection of the RV from infarction. $#(Choice D)#  Fibroblast proliferation is more prominent in the muscular LV, where repair of a larger mass of tissue is needed. $#Educational objective# The right ventricle (RV) is relatively protected from myocardial infarction (MI), and contractile function of the RV usually returns to normal following MI.

  "explanation_2": "This patient with several weeks of palpitations and fatigue has #atrial fibrillation#, which is recognized on @ECG@ by an irregularly irregular rhythm (irregular R-R intervals) and an absence of organized P waves.  Atrial fibrillation usually occurs in the setting of #atrial remodeling#, which describes changes to the atrial myocardium that result from both normal #aging# and underlying comorbidities that cause #atrial dilation# (eg, hypertension, heart failure, mitral valve disease).  Coronary artery disease and its associated risk factors (eg, diabetes mellitus, smoking) are also associated with atrial fibrillation, although their contribution may be primarily driven by ischemia that leads to left ventricular dysfunction and consequent left atrial dilation. $#Age#, independent of comorbidities, is one of the #strongest risk factors# for atrial fibrillation.  Atrial fibrillation is relatively rare in those age <40, but the prevalence is estimated at approximately 10% in those age >75 and approaches 20% in those age >85. $#(Choices B and D)#  After remodeling has created a susceptible substrate, certain triggers (eg, increased sympathetic drive) can initiate atrial fibrillation.  Heavy alcohol use (eg, large binges or chronic ingestion of >1-2 drinks per day) is one such trigger, but occasional alcohol intake is unlikely to significantly contribute.  High caffeine intake (eg, coffee) may somewhat encourage the triggering of atrial fibrillation (via increased sympathetic stimulation), but there is little evidence to support this association. $#(Choice C)#  This patient's early peaking systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border with prompt and full carotid pulses is consistent with mild aortic stenosis.  Both mitral regurgitation and especially mitral stenosis are strongly associated with atrial fibrillation as these valvular defects can cause left atrial dilation even in the absence of heart failure.  However, aortic stenosis typically must be severe to cause left atrial dilation; mild aortic stenosis is not associated with atrial fibrillation. $#(Choice E)#  Beta adrenergic agonists (eg, albuterol) may sometimes trigger atrial fibrillation by stimulating the generation of ectopic conduction foci.  However, terazosin is an alpha blocker and does not significantly affect cardiac conduction. $#Educational objective# Age, independent of comorbidities, is one of the strongest risk factors for atrial fibrillation as age-related change to the atrial myocardium is one of the primary contributors to atrial remodeling.  Left atrial dilation is the other primary contributor to atrial remodeling; therefore, comorbidities that cause left atrial dilation (eg, hypertension, heart failure, mitral valve disease) are also strongly associated with atrial fibrillation.

  "explanation_2": "$Deglutition (swallowing) is a complex process that involves 3 phases:  $1. In the voluntary oral phase, the food bolus is collected in the back of the mouth and lifted upward to the posterior wall of the pharynx.  $2. This initiates the pharyngeal phase, which consists of involuntary pharyngeal muscle contractions that propel the food bolus to the esophagus.  $3. During the esophageal phase, food stretches the walls of the esophagus, stimulating peristalsis just above the site of distension and moving the food downward.  Relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) follows, allowing the food bolus to enter the stomach. $Abnormal spasm or diminished relaxation of the cricopharyngeal muscles during swallowing (#cricopharyngeal motor dysfunction#) is thought to be the underlying mechanism of @Zenker diverticulum@ formation.  This process results in early #oropharyngeal dysphagia# with a feeling of food obstruction at the level of the neck and coughing/choking.  Increased oropharyngeal intraluminal pressure eventually results in herniation of the pharyngeal mucosa through a zone of muscle weakness (@false diverticulum@) in the posterior hypopharynx (Killian triangle).  Patients consequently develop food retention with #halitosis/regurgitation#.  #Pulmonary aspiration# of diverticular contents may also lead to recurrent pneumonia.  As the diverticulum enlarges, it may become palpable as a lateral neck mass, and dysphagia can worsen due to luminal narrowing caused by extrinsic esophageal compression. $#(Choice B)#  Degenerative changes of the myenteric plexus with impaired LES relaxation result in achalasia.  Barium swallow typically shows esophageal dilation with esophagogastric junction narrowing (@\"bird's beak\"@). $#(Choice C)#  Mucosal tears around the gastroesophageal junction can be caused by increased intraluminal pressure in the stomach during prolonged or recurrent retching/vomiting (Mallory-Weiss syndrome). $#(Choice D)#  Retention cysts form due to accumulation of trapped secretions following obstruction of a gland's duct.  Chronic rhinosinusitis frequently causes mucus retention cysts in the maxillary sinus. $#(Choice E)#  Mediastinal lymphadenitis (eg, due to tuberculosis, fungal infections) can cause scarring/traction of the mid-portion of the esophagus, resulting in the formation of true diverticula (containing all gut wall layers). $#Educational objective# Diminished relaxation of cricopharyngeal muscles during swallowing results in increased intraluminal pressure in the oropharynx.  This may eventually cause the mucosa to herniate through a zone of muscle weakness in the posterior hypopharynx, forming a Zenker (false) diverticulum, which presents in elderly patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia, halitosis, regurgitation, and recurrent aspiration.

Gliadin, a component of gluten, is responsible for triggering the T-cell–mediated reaction against the small-bowel mucosa seen in celiac disease.  This is initially characterized by intraepithelial lymphocytosis, followed as the disease progresses by a #loss of small-bowel intestinal villi# and #mucosal atrophy#.  This decreases the nutritional absorptive capabilities of the small bowel, particularly in the duodenum and proximal jejunum. $Because iron is absorbed primarily in the duodenum, #iron deficiency# leading to #microcytic anemia# is a common manifestation of celiac disease; common presenting features include fatigue and pale mucosa.  Other symptoms of gluten-sensitive enteropathy include #postprandial diarrhea# and steatorrhea (eg, pale, loose stools), #abdominal cramps#, bloating, flatulence, and weight loss.  Celiac disease is not associated with elevated systemic inflammatory markers (eg, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate), and unlike gastrointestinal disorders that cause chronic blood loss (eg, inflammatory bowel disease, colon cancer), in celiac disease, fecal occult blood testing is negative. $#(Choice B)#  Pernicious anemia is characterized by antibody-mediated destruction of intrinsic factor and gastric parietal cells.

Major risk factors include #alcohol abuse#, recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis, and smoking. $Patients classically have #epigastric pain# that worsens with meals; pain is initially intermittent but may become constant in advanced disease.  Other signs and symptoms of chronic pancreatitis are due to the following pathophysiologic changes: $• #Endocrine insufficiency#: Destruction of islet cells results in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. $• #Exocrine insufficiency#: Destruction of acinar cells results in lipase, elastase, amylase, trypsin, and chymotrypsin deficiency.  This results in protein and fat malabsorption with #weight loss#, #steatorrhea#, and fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies. $#Elastase #is derived from a zymogen produced by pancreatic acinar cells and activated by trypsin in the duodenum; levels #correlate with pancreatic exocrine activity#.  Therefore, #low fecal elastase# can help diagnose #pancreatic insufficiency# and supports a diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis.  Other useful tests include Sudan staining (which identifies fecal fat) and hemoglobin A1c (which diagnoses diabetes mellitus). $#(Choice A)#  Bile acid synthesis, which occurs in the liver, is not affected by chronic pancreatitis.  Bile acids are necessary for proper biliary flow; therefore, bile acid synthesis disorders usually present with cholestasis, jaundice, and hepatic failure in neonates. $#(Choice C)#  Autoimmune gastritis occurs due to autoantibodies directed at parietal cells and intrinsic factor, resulting in reduced intrinsic factor production.  Although patients may have postprandial abdominal pain, they also typically have macrocytic anemia (due to vitamin B12 deficiency).  Steatorrhea (due to fat malabsorption) is unexpected. $#(Choice D)#  The pancreas normally produces a bicarbonate-rich fluid that neutralizes stomach acid.  Chronic pancreatitis results in progressive pancreatic destruction, leading to decreased pancreatic bicarbonate production. $#(Choice E)#  Villous atrophy of the small bowel is characteristic of celiac disease.  Although patients can have steatorrhea and abdominal pain, celiac disease also usually causes iron deficiency anemia.  In addition, chronic pancreatitis is more likely in this patient with heavy alcohol use. $#Educational objective# Chronic pancreatitis is an inflammatory disorder leading to pancreatic fibrosis and atrophy, resulting in endocrine (ie, insulin) and exocrine (eg, lipase, elastase, amylase, trypsin, chymotrypsin) insufficiencies.  Patients typically have postprandial steatorrhea (ie, bulky diarrhea that is difficult to flush) and epigastric pain with meals.

HCl helps denature dietary protein (improving proteolysis) and converts pepsinogen to its active form, pepsin, which preferentially cleaves polypeptides at aromatic amino acid locations.  However, patients can still digest protein after undergoing total gastrectomy because of the action of #pancreatic and intestinal proteases#, which degrade dietary proteins into basic amino acids in the small intestine; therefore, it is unnecessary to administer gastric enzymes, HCl, or hydrolyzed protein in these patients #(choices A, B, and C)#. $• #Intrinsic factor (IF) secretion:#  Parietal cells in the body and fundus of the stomach secrete IF, a glycoprotein that binds to vitamin B12, a #water-soluble# vitamin.

  "explanation_2": "This patient's symptoms are consistent with #dumping syndrome#, a common complication of gastric surgery. $Normally, food moves through the stomach slowly, ensuring proper digestion.  First, the fundus relaxes (ie, accommodation), which allows the stomach to function as a reservoir and facilitates digestion by acid and proteases.  As food moves to the antrum, it is broken down by high-amplitude muscular contractions.  The #pyloric sphincter# serves as a barrier and allows only tiny, properly digested food particles to move to the small intestine. $When the pyloric sphincter is surgically removed or circumvented, as in @Roux-en-Y gastric bypass@, #incompletely digested food particles# enter the small intestine rapidly.  The undigested material is often #hyperosmolar# and causes fluid movement from the intravascular space to the intestinal lumen.  Activation of autonomic (sympathetic) reflexes and the release of vasoactive hormones (eg, serotonin, vasoactive intestinal peptide) may also occur.

These findings are consistent with #Wilson disease#, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by accumulation of copper due to a #defective copper transport protein#, ATP7B. $In general, dietary copper is absorbed in the stomach and duodenum and bound to circulating albumin.  It is then transported to the liver and taken up by hepatocytes.  Excessive intracellular copper levels normally cause ATP7B to transfer the excess copper into the bile canaliculi.

Following partial pancreatic resection, he may develop clinically significant deficiency in any of the pancreatic digestive enzymes normally secreted into the duodenum. $Pancreatic amylases, along with salivary and brush border amylases, are required for the degradation of polysaccharides into monosaccharides, as polysaccharides cannot be absorbed by the intestinal mucosa.

Onset is dominated by nonspecific symptoms, although patients may develop a #serum sickness-like# syndrome with joint pain, lymphadenopathy, and a pruritic @urticarial vasculitis@ rash.  Right upper quadrant pain can also be present. $Acute HBV is characterized by significant elevations in #aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase#, often >10 times the upper limit of normal.  Most patients will have nonicteric hepatitis, but icteric hepatitis with jaundice and elevated bilirubin is also common.  Impaired hepatic synthetic function, as indicated by a prolonged prothrombin time, confers a poor prognosis.

Given that her brother likely developed cirrhosis complicated by variceal hemorrhage in his 40s, the most probable underlying cause is #hereditary hemochromatosis (HH)#. $Total iron stores in the body are tightly regulated at the point of intake, with gastrointestinal absorption adjusted to match daily losses.  HH is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by #increased intestinal iron absorption#; because there is no specific mechanism to excrete unneeded iron, the excess iron (typically 0.5-1.0 g/yr) accumulates in the parenchymal organs (eg, liver, heart). $HH is usually silent in early adulthood, manifesting only after >20 g of iron has accumulated in the body.

Spinal cord involvement explains this patient's #loss of vibratory sensation# (dorsal columns) and #ataxia# (spinocerebellar tract); her #weakness# (eg, frequent falls) and #hyporeflexia# are secondary to peripheral neuropathies. $Deficiency of vitamin E is rare in resource-rich regions due to widespread availability in dietary sources; instead, the most common cause is #fat malabsorption#.

Vitamin A is a lipid-soluble vitamin necessary for vision (phototransduction, retinal and conjunctival development) and keratinocyte differentiation.  Deficiency is characterized by #night blindness# and #xerophthalmia# (conjunctival and corneal dryness).  In some patients, abnormal conjunctival keratinization may lead to Bitot spots, or foamy white plaques in the eye.  Nonspecific dermatologic findings are also common and may include #hyperkeratosis# (thickened skin), as seen here. $Dietary intake of vitamin A comes from a combination of beta-carotene, a provitamin found in plants (eg, green leafy vegetables, carrots), and preformed vitamin A from animal sources (eg, eggs, liver, kidney).  In resource-rich regions, most individuals have adequate dietary intake of vitamin A, but patients may develop deficiency due to fat malabsorption related to biliary obstruction, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (eg, cystic fibrosis), or small-bowel resection (eg, Crohn disease, bariatric surgery). $This patient with generalized #pruritus# and signs of vitamin A deficiency should be evaluated for @primary biliary cholangitis (PBC)@, an autoimmune disease most common in middle-aged women and characterized by destruction of small intrahepatic bile ducts.  Because bile acids are important for solubilization and absorption of fats, patients with #chronic biliary obstruction# due to PBC may develop #deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins# (A, D, E, and K).  Generalized pruritus is common due to bile acid accumulation in the skin; jaundice is often not apparent until later in the disease course. $#(Choices A and B)#  Inadequate exposure to sunlight can cause vitamin D deficiency in individuals without adequate dietary vitamin D intake.  Chronic kidney disease can also result in vitamin D deficiency due to reduced production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.  Vitamin D deficiency is characterized by bone pain and fractures (eg, osteomalacia), not night blindness. $#(Choice D)#  Sickle cell disease is a form of chronic hemolytic anemia that can cause retinopathy due to microvascular vasoocclusion, retinal ischemia, and neovascularization/hemorrhage.  However, vision impairment would not be restricted to nighttime, and affected patients would likely have other vasoocclusive symptoms (eg, pain crises). $#(Choice E)#  A strict vegan diet is a risk factor for vitamin B12 (cobalamin), not vitamin A, deficiency.  Vitamin B12 deficiency presents with megaloblastic anemia (eg, fatigue, pallor) and neurologic deficits (eg, tingling, numbness). $#Educational objective# Vitamin A deficiency causes night blindness and hyperkeratosis.

  "explanation_2": "$#Crohn disease# is an inflammatory bowel disease characterized by patchy granulomatous inflammation.  Any area of the gastrointestinal tract may be involved, but involvement of the #terminal ileum# is especially common.  Bile acids, which facilitate the absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins, are normally reabsorbed in the ileum, recycled in the liver, and then reused in the absorptive process.  When the terminal ileum is inflamed, bile acids are lost in the feces, leading to #impaired fat absorption#. $In the healthy bowel, dietary calcium binds to dietary oxalate, producing insoluble calcium oxalate salts that are eliminated in the feces.  But in malabsorptive syndromes such as Crohn disease, calcium forms soap complexes with the excess fat in the intestinal lumen and is unavailable for complexing with oxalate.  As a result, free #oxalate absorption# is increased and subsequently filtered into the urine, promoting the formation of #oxalate kidney stones# (enteric oxaluria). $#(Choice A)#  Cystinuria is an autosomal recessive condition characterized by defective dibasic amino acid transport in the proximal renal tubules.  The urine becomes supersaturated with cystine, leading to formation of cystine stones beginning in childhood or adolescence.  Crohn disease can cause malabsorption of dietary protein and amino acids, but this is due to inflammation, not abnormal amino acid transporters; patients are not predisposed to cystine stones. $#(Choice B)#  Patients with Crohn disease commonly develop vitamin/nutrient deficiencies (eg, vitamin D, calcium) due to malabsorption, which can reduce bone mineral density and increase the risk of fractures.  Secondary hyperparathyroidism may be present, but unlike primary hyperparathyroidism does not promote kidney stone formation. $#(Choice C)#  Uric acid stones may develop from conditions associated with rapid cell turnover (eg, myeloproliferative disease, hemolytic anemia) due to chronically increased uric acid production.  The stones seen in Crohn disease are composed of calcium oxalate rather than uric acid. $#(Choice E)#  Alkalinization of the urine by urease-producing organisms (eg, Proteus, Klebsiella) in the upper urinary tract can promote formation of stones made up of magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) and calcium carbonate apatite.  Although patients with Crohn disease can develop enterovesicular fistulas and recurrent urinary tract infections, this patient has no features of urinary infection (eg, fever, dysuria, pyuria). $#Educational objective# Crohn disease is associated with oxalate kidney stones.  Impaired bile acid absorption in the terminal ileum leads to loss of bile acids in feces with subsequent fat malabsorption.  Intestinal lipids then bind calcium ions, and the resulting soap complex is excreted.  Free oxalate (normally bound by calcium to form an unabsorbable complex) is absorbed and forms urinary calculi (enteric oxaluria).  "

  "explanation_2": "This patient with cirrhosis (hepatitis C infection, abdominal distention, gynecomastia) most likely developed #hepatic encephalopathy# due to his recent #gastrointestinal (GI) bleed#.  Hepatic encephalopathy refers to a reversible decline in neurologic function that occurs due to failure of the liver to metabolize waste products such as ammonia.  Ammonia is normally produced by the GI tract as a result of enterocytic catabolism of glutamine and colonic bacterial catabolism of dietary protein.  GI bleeding causes #increased nitrogen delivery# to the gut in the form of hemoglobin, which is then converted into ammonia and absorbed into the bloodstream.  The ammonia then enters the liver through the portal vein and is detoxified to urea. $In chronic liver failure, hepatocyte dysfunction and the shunting of blood through portosystemic collaterals impair the liver's detoxification ability.  This leads to #accumulation of ammonia# and other neurotoxins in the circulation, causing altered amino acid transport across the blood-brain barrier, impaired neurotransmitter metabolism, and depressed cerebral glucose metabolism.  These and other factors result in #increased inhibitory neurotransmission# (eg, γ-aminobutyric acid [GABA]) and #impaired excitatory neurotransmitter release# (eg, glutamate, catecholamines). $In patients with hepatic encephalopathy, lowering of blood ammonia levels is typically accomplished with oral administration of a disaccharide (eg, #lactulose#).  Bacterial action on lactulose results in acidification of colonic contents, which then converts absorbable ammonia into nonabsorbable ammonium ions, trapping it in the stool and thereby increasing fecal nitrogen excretion. $#(Choice A)#  Accumulation of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is suggestive of renal failure, heart failure, or dehydration.  In healthy patients, GI bleeding can also cause a rapid increase in BUN.  However, this patient has cirrhosis, which is associated with decreased BUN because ammonia cannot be efficiently converted to urea by the failing liver. $#(Choice B)#  Bacterial meningitis presents with altered mental status, fever, nuchal rigidity, headache, and photophobia.  In addition, asterixis (flapping tremor) is specific for metabolic encephalopathies. $#(Choice C)#  The altered mental status seen in hepatic encephalopathy is due to increased (not decreased) activity of the GABA neurotransmitter system.  This enhanced activity is caused by increased GABA receptor affinity and alterations in neurosteroid synthesis rather than increased GABA production. $#(Choice E)#  The middle cerebral artery is the largest cerebral artery and the one most commonly involved in cerebrovascular accidents.  This patient's presentation is suggestive of hepatic encephalopathy rather than stroke. $#Educational objective# Hepatic encephalopathy is caused by increased levels of ammonia and other neurotoxins in the circulation that lead to increased inhibitory neurotransmission and impaired excitatory neurotransmitter release.  Hepatic encephalopathy is frequently precipitated by a stressor (eg, gastrointestinal bleeding, infection) that increases blood ammonia levels.  "

Trypsin can also activate other trypsinogen molecules; therefore, even small amounts of it can result in an #activation cascade#.  Because of trypsin's central role in the activation of pancreatic digestive proenzymes, multiple protective mechanisms exist to limit the amount of trypsinogen that becomes prematurely activated: $• Serine peptidase inhibitor Kazal-type 1 (#SPINK1#) is secreted by pancreatic acinar cells and functions as a #trypsin inhibitor#.

  "explanation_1": "#Acute cholecystitis# is caused by gallstone obstruction of the #cystic duct# in more than 90% of cases.  Ingestion of fatty foods then stimulates contraction of the gallbladder against the impacted stone, resulting in severe colicky pain.  Mechanical disruption of the gallbladder mucosa and release of inflammatory mediators (eg, lysolecithin, prostaglandins) cause the obstructed gallbladder to become inflamed and edematous.  As blood supply to the distended organ becomes compromised, secondary bacterial infection frequently develops.  Potential complications include gangrene and perforation, with subsequent formation of a pericholecystic abscess or generalized peritonitis. $Ultrasonography is the #preferred# initial imaging test for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis; however, nuclear medicine hepatobiliary scanning (ie, cholescintigraphy) can be an alternate means when ultrasonography is #inconclusive#.  During a hepatobiliary scan, a radiotracer is administered intravenously and is preferentially taken up by hepatocytes and excreted into bile.  Images of the tracer as it moves through the hepatobiliary system and intestine are then obtained for up to several hours after injection.  ",
  "explanation_2": "$In patients with a patent cystic duct, the gallbladder will be seen as the radiotracer accumulates and concentrates within (image C).  In acute or chronic cholecystitis, the radiotracer will be taken up by the liver with progressive excretion into the common bile duct and proximal small bowel, but the #gallbladder will not be visualized# due to the obstruction (image A and B). $#(Choice A)#  Distended duodenum on an upper gastrointestinal series would be suggestive of small-bowel obstruction (as seen with gallstone ileus). $#(Choice B)#  The presence of echogenic structures within the gallbladder on ultrasound can be suggestive of acute cholecystitis in the setting of fever and abdominal pain, but it is not diagnostic.  Cholelithiasis can also cause more benign biliary colic, or be an incidental asymptomatic finding in the setting of other abdominal pathology.  Ultrasound findings more specific for acute cholecystitis include gallbladder wall thickening, pericholecystic fluid, and a positive sonographic Murphy sign. $#(Choice D)#  Mild increases in serum aspartate and alanine aminotransferase levels can occur in acute cholecystitis, but they are nonspecific and do not aid the diagnosis. $#(Choice E)#  Most patients have insufficient calcium in their gallstones to be visualized on an abdominal x-ray. $#Educational objective# Acute cholecystitis is most often caused by gallstones obstructing the cystic duct.  The diagnosis can be made by identifying signs of gallbladder inflammation (eg, wall thickening, pericholecystic fluid) on ultrasonography.  When ultrasound is inconclusive, nuclear medicine hepatobiliary scanning (ie, cholescintigraphy) can be used to assess cystic duct patency and make the diagnosis.  "

Gastroparesis is a type of #autonomic neuropathy# involving the gastrointestinal tract and is characterized by delayed gastric emptying not due to an obstruction. $Normal postprandial gastric activity is a multistep process that occurs in response to food ingestion.  After food passes down the esophagus, vagally stimulated enteric neurons release nitric oxide to induce relaxation of the fundus of the stomach and accommodate the incoming food bolus.  Specialized gastric pacemaker cells (interstitial cells of Cajal) initiate pacesetter potentials (slow waves), which generate circumferential contractions of the gastric smooth muscle (peristalsis).  Peristalsis facilitates food mixing and propulsion toward the pylorus. $#Chronic hyperglycemia# in patients with diabetes can result in #destruction of the enteric neurons#.  Loss of nitric oxide–containing neurons results in impaired fundal relaxation, and loss of the interstitial cells of Cajal results in uncoordinated smooth muscle contractions and ineffective peristalsis, both of which #delay gastric emptying#. $#(Choice A)#  Chronic hyperglycemia can cause vagus nerve denervation with axonal damage, which can contribute to diabetic gastroparesis.  However, the vagal motor nucleus is located in the brainstem and is typically unaffected by diabetes. $#(Choice B)#  Disruption of the lower esophageal sphincter can cause symptoms of acid reflux.  Although severe gastroesophageal reflux can cause regurgitation, a history of heartburn or epigastric pain would be expected.  In addition, upper endoscopy typically shows evidence of esophagitis (eg, mucosal erythema, exudates). $#(Choice D)#  Cholecystokinin is secreted in response to fat- or protein-rich meals and slows gastric emptying to improve digestion of these nutrients.  Cholecystokinin secretion may actually be reduced in diabetes and is not thought to be a major cause of diabetic gastroparesis. $#(Choice E)#  Hypertrophy of pyloric smooth muscles is seen in congenital pyloric stenosis, which causes projective vomiting and is typically diagnosed in infancy.  The smooth muscle cells typically remain normal in diabetic gastroparesis. $#Educational objective# Diabetic gastroparesis results from the destruction of enteric neurons due to chronic hyperglycemia, leading to impaired relaxation and disordered and ineffective peristalsis.

  "explanation_2": "#Sickle cell disease (SCD)# is the most common autosomal recessive disorder in African Americans.  Its manifestations include the following: $• #Hemolysis:#  Repeated @sickling@ of red blood cells leads to permanent deformation and premature erythrocyte destruction by macrophages and mechanical stress.  This causes #intra- and extravascular hemolysis#, resulting in increased indirect bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase and #decreased haptoglobin#.  Haptoglobin binds circulating hemoglobin and reduces renal excretion of free hemoglobin, preventing tubular injury. $• #Vasoocclusive symptoms:#  Patients with SCD may experience pain from hypoxic tissue injury and infarctions due to obstruction of small vessels by sickled cells.  Microvascular occlusion typically involves the bone marrow, periosteum, and deep muscles but can occur in other organs.  This patient is presenting with #dactylitis# (hand-foot syndrome), which results from small infarctions in the bones of the extremities.  These infarctions cause swelling, tenderness, and warmth.  Dactylitis is common in patients with SCD during the first few years of life as the affected bones still contain hematopoietic bone marrow.  In older children and adults, vascular occlusion leads to pain crises, acute chest syndrome, leg ulceration, priapism, autosplenectomy, and stroke. $• #Infections:# Patients with SCD are predisposed to infections with #encapsulated organisms# (eg, Streptococcus pneumoniae) because repeated splenic infarcts cause functional asplenia. $#(Choices A and E)#  The chronic anemia in SCD can result in cardiomegaly due to chronically increased cardiac output (systolic function is largely preserved due to an increase in stroke volume).  However, this typically does not occur until after infancy.  Older patients can develop congestive heart failure due to ischemic cardiomyopathy and present with decreased cardiac output and increased systemic venous pressure. $#(Choices B and F)#  Serum albumin and urine cortisol excretion are typically normal in patients with SCD. $#(Choice C)#  Hereditary angioedema is a rare autosomal dominant disorder that is associated with painless episodes of swelling involving the face, lips, larynx, and extremities.  It is caused by C1-inhibitor deficiency, not vasoocclusion. $#Educational objective# Dactylitis (painful swelling of the hands and feet) is a common presentation of sickle cell disease (SCD) in young children.  It is one of many vasoocclusive manifestations of SCD.  Sickling episodes result in hemolysis, which leads to increased indirect bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase and decreased levels of haptoglobin.  ",

Myeloma cells replicate in the bone marrow and release cytokines that stimulate osteoclasts and inhibit osteoblasts, which leads to the generation of purely @osteolytic (radiolucent) bone lesions@. $Bone remodeling is tightly regulated by osteocytes (stromal bone marrow cells that are embedded within the lacuna-canalicular network) in conjunction with signals from the bone marrow and the bone surface.  The RANK/RANKL pathway plays a prominent role.  RANK is a transmembrane receptor on the surface of osteoclast precursors, which is activated by RANK-ligand (RANKL) produced by osteocytes.  #Activation of RANK# leads to the differentiation of osteoclast precursors into mature osteoclasts. $Myeloma cells stimulate osteoclast maturation by producing RANKL and by destroying osteoprotegerin (OPG), mediated by a secreted proteoglycan.  They also uniquely inhibit osteoblast activity by secreting cytokines that block osteoblast function (eg, IL-3, IL-7, Wnt pathway inhibitors).  This tilts the balance of bone remodeling strongly toward #osteolytic bone destruction#, which results in many of the characteristic findings seen in MM, including bone pain, #hypercalcemia# (liberation of calcium during osteolysis), and purely radiolucent (osteolytic) bone lesions. $#(Choice A)#  Decreased urinary calcium excretion can be seen with thiazide diuretic use and can result in hypercalcemia.

  "explanation_2": "#Primary myelofibrosis# is a chronic myeloproliferative disorder marked by the clonal expansion of atypical megakaryocytes.  These atypical cells produce transforming growth factor-beta, which stimulates fibroblasts in the bone marrow to lay down collagen, leading to subsequent #bone marrow fibrosis#.  Because fibrotic bone marrow is inhospitable to hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, these precursor cells migrate out of the bone marrow to the liver and spleen, the primary sites of #extramedullary hematopoiesis#. $The proliferation of erythroid, myeloid, and megakaryocytic #progenitor cells in the spleen# leads to a marked expansion of the splenic red pulp and usually results in #dramatic splenomegaly#.  Nucleated red cells and immature granulocytes spill into the circulation and can be identified on peripheral blood smear.  @Dacrocytes@ are also common due to erythrocyte membrane damage during red blood cell production in the spleen or fibrotic marrow.  Because extramedullary hematopoiesis is less efficient than medullary hematopoiesis, patients typically have one or more #cytopenias#. $The diagnosis of primary myelofibrosis requires bone marrow evaluation.  Aspiration of bone marrow is frequently unsuccessful (#dry tap#) due to fibrosis.  Therefore, bone marrow biopsy is generally required and usually shows hypocellular marrow with @significant fibrosis@ and atypical megakaryocytes.  A minority of primary myelofibrosis cases have been linked to chemical exposure (eg, toluene, benzene). $#(Choice A)#  @Gaucher disease@ is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease associated with hepatosplenomegaly and pancytopenia due to the accumulation of glucocerebroside within the cytoplasm of macrophages (crumpled-paper appearance).  However, most cases present in childhood.  In addition, a dry tap on bone marrow aspirate and dacrocytes on peripheral smear would be atypical. $#(Choice B)#  Acute infections of the spleen (eg, septic emboli from infective endocarditis) are typically associated with diffuse neutrophilic infiltration.  Follicular necrosis is also common if the infection is due to group A Streptococcus.  A dry tap, dacrocytes, and lack of fever make this less likely. $#(Choice C)#  Congestive splenomegaly due to portal hypertension (eg, from liver cirrhosis) is associated with dilated sinusoids, fibrosis of the red pulp, and hemosiderin-laden macrophages.  A dry tap and dacrocytes would not be seen. $#(Choice E)#  Splenic noncaseating granulomas are common in @sarcoidosis@, some malignancies, and some infectious disorders.  However, a dry tap and dacrocytes make primary myelofibrosis far more likely. $#Educational objective# Primary myelofibrosis is a chronic myeloproliferative disorder associated with bone marrow fibrosis.  Extramedullary hematopoiesis leads to marked expansion of the splenic red pulp with hematopoietic progenitor cells, resulting in massive splenomegaly.  Patients also usually have hepatomegaly, cytopenias, and peripheral smear abnormalities (eg, dacrocytes, nucleated red cells, immature granulocytes).  ",

  "explanation_2": "#Von Willebrand disease# (vWD) is caused by genetic mutations that lead to decreased quantity or impaired function of #von Willebrand factor# (vWF), a multimeric glycoprotein produced by platelets and endothelial cells.  VWF has 2 important @hemostatic functions@:  $1. It binds platelets to vascular subendothelial components at sites of injury (and platelets to each other), which results in the formation of hemostatic platelet plugs.  Therefore, patients with VWD have impaired platelet aggregation but #normal platelet count# (as platelet consumption/production is unaffected).  $2. VWF acts as a #carrier protein for factor VIII# and protects it from degradation.  Because factor VIII is part of the @intrinsic@ (contact activation) coagulation pathway, patients with VWD sometimes have #prolonged PTT# (due to increased destruction of factor VIII), but #PT will be normal#. $VWD is typically transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion so a #family history# of bleeding is often an important diagnostic clue.  Most cases are asymptomatic, but a minority (~1%) have easy bruising, skin bleeding, and bleeding from mucous membranes (eg, oropharyngeal, gastrointestinal, uterine).  Testing for vWF level and activity (eg, ristocetin cofactor assay) can help confirm the diagnosis. $#(Choice A)#  Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disease associated with immune-mediated platelet destruction.  Although patients with ITP often have easy bleeding, VWF levels and activity are normal, and a family history of bleeding is uncommon (as ITP is an acquired disorder).  ITP is marked by thrombocytopenia and normal PT/PTT. $#(Choice B)#  Disseminated intravascular coagulation is caused by widespread activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis due to sepsis, malignancy, trauma, or obstetric complication.  It is an acquired disorder, so a family history of bleeding is uncommon.  Disseminated intravascular coagulation is associated with low platelets and elevated PT and PTT. $#(Choice D)#  Vitamin K deficiency and warfarin use impair synthesis of vitamin K–dependent clotting factors (II, VII, IX, and X), which leads to prolonged PT and normal platelet count and PTT (PTT can sometimes be mildly elevated).  Although vitamin K deficiency is common in newborns, it is very uncommon in otherwise healthy children and adults.  In addition, the family history of bleeding disorder makes this much less likely than vWD. $#(Choice E)#  Patients with severe liver disease often have impaired hepatic synthetic function and are unable to generate sufficient quantities of clotting factors.  Therefore, they often have elevated PT and PTT (with normal or low platelets).  This otherwise healthy boy is unlikely to have significant liver disease. $#Educational objective# Von Willebrand disease is the most common inherited bleeding disorder and is usually transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion.  Symptomatic patients typically present with easy bruising and mucosal bleeding.  Laboratory evaluation will show normal platelets, normal PT, and either normal or prolonged PTT due to low levels of factor VIII.  ",

Although chronic alcohol use can cause bone marrow suppression due to toxic effects on hematopoietic stem cells, severe leukopenia or thrombocytopenia is rare. $#(Choice B)#  Chronic blood loss causes iron deficiency, which leads to normocytic (early) or microcytic (late) anemia.  In contrast, the presence of macrocytic anemia and hypersegmented neutrophils indicates megaloblastic anemia, which is caused by folate and vitamin B12 deficiency. $#(Choice D)#  This patient's low reticulocyte count indicates that the bone marrow is unable to appropriately accelerate erythrocyte production in response to his anemia.  In contrast, when anemia is due primarily to peripheral hemolysis, reticulocyte count is elevated as a result of rapid mobilization of maturing bone marrow erythrocytes. $#Educational objective# Folate is essential for nucleic acid metabolism, and deficiency causes ineffective hematopoiesis with a low reticulocyte count.

A number of underlying processes can cause anemia, but the differential diagnosis can usually be narrowed by concurrent clinical data.  In this case, the peripheral blood smear demonstrates #hypochromic, microcytic erythrocytes# and a variety of erythrocyte shapes #(poikilocytosis)#, raising strong suspicion for severe @iron deficiency anemia@ (IDA).  Young women often develop IDA from heavy menstruation. $Patients with severe IDA do not have enough iron to generate adequate hemoglobin for each erythrocyte, which results in low mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (hypochromia) and small erythrocyte size (microcytosis).  Interstitial fibroblasts in the peritubular capillaries and proximal convoluted tubule of the kidney detect the reduced oxygen carrying capacity of the blood (mild tissue hypoxia) and #increase erythropoietin release# to drive the generation of new erythrocytes.  However, new erythrocytes cannot be produced at a level to compensate for the anemia due to insufficient serum iron; therefore, patients typically have #minimal reticulocytes# and #low red blood cell counts# in the peripheral blood. $#(Choice A)#  Transferrin is a serum protein that binds free iron.  The concentration of transferrin is increased in IDA (to maximize free iron scavenge), but the amount of iron bound to it is reduced, leading to a low transferrin saturation on laboratory evaluation. $#(Choices B, C, and E)#  Hepcidin is a small peptide released by the liver in response to inflammation.  It binds to and inhibits iron channels on the surface of enterocytes and on reticuloendothelial macrophages, which reduces iron absorption in the gut and reduces iron release from the reticuloendothelial system (the primary site of iron recycling).  Because IDA is not mediated by inflammation, hepcidin levels are typically low; this increases gastrointestinal iron absorption and iron release from the reticuloendothelial system (eg, splenic macrophages).  In contrast, anemia of chronic disease is associated with very high levels of hepcidin (and other inflammatory cytokines), which reduces iron availability for erythrocytosis despite adequate total body stores of iron.  Patients with anemia of chronic disease typically have normocytic anemia and normochromia (not hypochromia). $#Educational objective# Patients with severe iron deficiency anemia (IDA) typically have evidence of hypochromic, microcytic erythrocytes on peripheral blood smear with poikilocytosis.  Laboratory studies will reveal low red blood cell count, low hepcidin, and high transferrin.  Although erythropoietin is markedly elevated in IDA, there is not enough iron to efficiently generate erythrocytes; therefore, reticulocyte count is low.  ",

Other common symptoms include weight loss, constipation (due to hypercalcemia), fatigue, and recurrent infection. $Kidney disease in MM is largely due to #light chain cast nephropathy# (myeloma kidney).

  "explanation_2": "This patient with morbid obesity has normocytic anemia with a low reticulocyte count, raising strong suspicion for #anemia of chronic disease# (ACD).  Because ACD is triggered by #long-standing elevations in serum inflammatory cytokines#, it is classically associated with underlying rheumatologic disease, persistent infection, or malignancy.  However, ACD is also commonly caused by less obvious sources of inflammation such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, severe traumatic injury, and #morbid obesity#. $The major inflammatory cytokine that drives ACD is #hepcidin#, a small peptide released from the liver in response to inflammation or bacterial lipopolysaccharide.  Hepcidin binds to and #inhibits iron channels# (ferroportin) on the surface of enterocytes and reticuloendothelial macrophages, leading to decreased iron absorption in the gut and decreased iron release by the reticuloendothelial system (which supplies ~95% of daily iron for erythropoiesis).  Because heme synthesis is impaired without sufficient iron, patients with ACD typically develop a #normocytic# (or slightly microcytic) #anemia# with a #minimal reticulocyte response#. $#(Choice B)#  Extravascular hemolysis typically occurs due to the formation of IgG autoantibodies against the erythrocyte membrane, which results in erythrocyte destruction by splenic macrophages.  Patients generally develop an acute normocytic anemia with a strong (not suppressed) reticulocyte response. $#(Choice C)#  Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia is associated with shearing of red blood cells in the microvasculature due to the formation of fibrin-rich platelet clots.  Patients typically have normocytic anemia, significant reticulocytosis, and severe thrombocytopenia (~10,000/mm3). $#(Choice D)#  Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) from an occult gastrointestinal bleed is common in older individuals.  IDA is also associated with a low reticulocyte count.  Although IDA can cause mild normocytic anemia early in the disease course, by the time individuals develop profound anemia (eg, hemoglobin of 8.6 mg/dL), they almost always have severe microcytosis (eg, MCV < 70).  This patient's severe anemia is accompanied by a normal MCV, making iron deficiency anemia highly unlikely. $#(Choice E)#  Vitamin B12 deficiency is associated with macrocytic (not normocytic) anemia due to impaired maturation of erythrocytes. $#Educational objective# Anemia of chronic disease (ACD) occurs in patients with rheumatologic diseases, chronic infection, malignancy, congestive heart failure, and morbid obesity due to chronic elevation of inflammatory cytokines.  The primary mediator is hepcidin, a peptide released from the liver that inhibits iron channels on enterocytes and reticuloendothelial macrophages.

The sharply demarcated purpuric lesion likely represents #warfarin-induced skin necrosis#, a rare complication that results from an excessive decrease in protein C activity; patients with underlying #protein C deficiency# are at increased risk. $Protein C and S are innate anticoagulants that are vitamin K dependent, as are procoagulant factors II, VII, IX, and X.  Warfarin inhibits @epoxide reductase@ (responsible for regenerating vitamin K), which leads to decreased levels of these proteins.  Factor VII and #protein C# are #depleted first# due to their shorter half-life.  The early loss of protein C activity relative to procoagulant factor activity leads to a #transient hypercoagulable state# that persists until the other procoagulant factors are @sufficiently inhibited@.  In patients with protein C deficiency, this procoagulant state is exaggerated, promoting #microvasculature occlusion# and hemorrhagic skin necrosis.  Underlying protein S deficiency also increases the risk of warfarin-induced skin necrosis, though not to the same extent. $Treatment of warfarin-induced skin necrosis includes discontinuing warfarin and administering fresh frozen plasma or protein C concentrate.  The condition may be prevented by the coadministration of heparin during the first several days of warfarin therapy. $#(Choice A)#  Allergic drug reactions are immune-mediated hypersensitivity reactions that can have variable cutaneous findings ranging from diffuse erythematous eruptions to extensive blistering and exfoliation (eg, Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis); this patient's recent warfarin use and localized skin findings are more suggestive of warfarin-induced skin necrosis. $#(Choice B)#  Antithrombin deficiency can be inherited (autosomal dominant) or acquired (eg, cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome) and presents with venous thromboembolism (eg, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) and resistance to heparin.  Warfarin does not affect antithrombin activity. $#(Choice C)#  Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is an autoimmune phenomenon that causes arterial and venous thrombosis.  It can produce skin findings similar to this patient's but would generally be associated with thrombocytopenia and recent heparin use. $#(Choice E)#  Vitamin K deficiency most often occurs in patients with fat malabsorption or those taking broad-spectrum antibiotics.  The deficiency increases the inhibitory effect of warfarin on all vitamin K-dependent proteins (both anticoagulant and procoagulant), so it does not alter the relative coagulability balance to encourage warfarin-induced skin necrosis. $#Education objective:# Patients started on warfarin develop a transient hypercoagulable state due to the short half-life of protein C.  This hypercoagulability is further exaggerated by preexisting protein C deficiency and can result in thrombotic occlusion of the microvasculature with skin necrosis.  ",

Most mutations are #point mutations# leading to faulty #mRNA processing# (eg, splicing error) or premature translation termination.

Impaired heme synthesis results in porphyria.  Thalassemia is due to disruption to the globin component. $#Educational objective# Patients with beta-thalassemia trait have 1 normal beta-globin allele and 1 mutated beta-globin allele.

She has a normal hematocrit, leukocyte count and differential, fibrinogen level, and prothrombin time/International Normalized Ratio.  She takes no medications, and there is no obvious hepatosplenomegaly on physical examination.  Taken together, these findings suggest an isolated acquired thrombocytopenia. $Common causes of acquired thrombocytopenia include increased platelet consumption, sequestration, and/or destruction.  In this patient, primary #immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)# is the most likely diagnosis as, other than thrombocytopenia (with associated ecchymosis), her physical examination and laboratory findings are unremarkable.  ITP is characterized by the #autoimmune# destruction of platelets by anti-platelet antibodies, likely IgG autoantibodies against the platelet membrane glycoproteins GPIIb/IIIa.  In children, ITP is typically acute and self-limited, whereas it tends to run an insidious and chronic course in adults.  A peripheral blood smear with #isolated# thrombocytopenia and no other platelet abnormalities would help confirm the diagnosis (megakaryocytes can sometimes be seen).  Treatment involves systemic immunosuppression (corticosteroids).  Secondary ITP is sometimes associated with HIV or hepatitis C infection. $#(Choice A)#  Bone marrow aplasia would cause pancytopenia.  It is unlikely that this patient's thrombocytopenia is due to bone marrow failure as the peripheral counts of the hematopoietic cell lines, other than platelets, are normal.  Common causes of aplastic anemia include parvovirus and Epstein-Barr virus infections, high-dose chemotherapy, and radiation. $#(Choice B)#  Malignant infiltration of the bone marrow would be expected to cause pancytopenia and extramedullary hematopoiesis within the liver and spleen, leading to hepatosplenomegaly. $#(Choice C)#  If this patient were experiencing accelerated platelet consumption due to disseminated intravascular coagulation, the plasma fibrinogen level would be decreased and the prothrombin time would be elevated due to clotting factor consumption. $#(Choice E)#  Splenic sequestration of platelets typically occurs in disorders that produce splenomegaly, such as portal hypertension; the platelet count usually remains >30,000/mm3, and abnormal bleeding generally does not occur.  Although platelets can undergo splenic sequestration in ITP, the primary mechanism responsible for the thrombocytopenia is immune destruction. $#(Choice F)#  In von Willebrand disease, platelet function is impaired because von Willebrand factor, which normally facilitates platelet binding to damaged endothelium, is deficient.  The platelet count would be normal (unlike in this patient), and the bleeding time and partial thromboplastin time would be prolonged. $#Educational objective# Autoimmune platelet destruction is a common cause of thrombocytopenia and should be suspected in patients with ecchymoses, petechiae, mucosal bleeding, and no other obvious causes of thrombocytopenia (eg, medications, bone marrow failure).

Other anticoagulant proteins (eg, protein C, protein S) are also rapidly consumed. $Patients with acute DIC usually have bleeding (eg, oozing from venipuncture sites) and end organ damage (eg, confusion, lung injury, renal insufficiency); laboratory studies are diagnostic and show #thrombocytopenia# (due to consumption of platelets) and #prolonged PT/PTT# (due to consumption of coagulation factors). $#Educational objective# Disseminated intravascular coagulation is marked by widespread activation of the coagulation cascade, leading to excessive thrombin production and formation of microthrombi.  Subsequent conversion of plasminogen to plasmin results in increased fibrinolysis to clear the thrombi.  Laboratory studies show a consumption of clotting factors (prolonged PT/PTT) and platelets (thrombocytopenia) and signs of excessive fibrinolysis (eg, elevated D-dimer).  ",

Additional treatment options include direct factor Xa inhibitors (eg, apixaban, rivaroxaban) and direct thrombin inhibitors (eg, dabigatran). $In general, medications that affect the extrinsic pathway prolong the prothrombin time (PT), whereas inhibition of the intrinsic pathway mainly prolongs the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT).

  "explanation_2": "$Beginning around age 6 months, term infants are at risk for developing iron deficiency.  They are typically born with enough iron required for the first few months of life.  As iron is lost steadily by shedding epithelium (eg, skin, intestinal tract), it must be replenished through dietary intake; newborns also require additional iron to support rapid body growth.  Breastmilk contains only a low concentration of iron.  Therefore, breastfed infants who do not receive additional iron-rich foods are at risk for developing iron deficiency. $Iron deficiency progresses through the following stages:  $1. #Decreased iron storage#:  When there is a net negative iron balance, iron is first removed from the storage pool (eg, hepatocytes, reticuloendothelial system); iron is stored intracellularly within ferritin complexes.  Ferritin is also found in the blood, and serum levels generally fluctuate in proportion to iron stores.  Therefore, the body's depletion of storage iron can be detected through a #low serum ferritin level#.  $2. #Iron-limited erythropoiesis#:  As iron stores become depleted, serum iron levels decrease, followed by a compensatory #rise in transferrin# and a resultant decrease in transferrin saturation #(choice E).#  During this phase, there is iron-limited erythropoiesis, in which newly made erythrocytes (ie, reticulocytes) are iron deficient and reticulocyte production may begin to be limited.  Because mature erythrocytes have a slow turnover (ie, 120 days), most cells sampled during this stage still have normal morphology, and the total hemoglobin value may still be normal.  $3. #Iron deficiency anemia#:  If iron deficiency continues, the last phase is frank iron deficiency anemia, which is reflected by a low hemoglobin level with #microcytosis# (low mean corpuscular volume [MCV]) and #hypochromia# (low mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration [MCHC]) in most erythrocytes #(choices B and C)#.  Reticulocyte production decreases, resulting in an inappropriately low number of reticulocytes #(choice D).# $Therefore, a patient in the earliest stages of iron deficiency anemia would likely have only decreased ferritin with an otherwise normal transferrin saturation, MCV, MCHC, and reticulocyte count. $#Educational objective# Infants who do not receive adequate iron supplementation are at risk for developing iron deficiency, which progresses in stages as total body iron is depleted.  The earliest stage involves loss of iron in storage (decreased serum ferritin), followed by iron-limited erythropoiesis with decreased serum iron and transferrin saturation.  Frank iron deficiency anemia, involving the classic findings of low hemoglobin, microcytic/hypochromic erythrocytes, and a low reticulocyte count, is a late finding.  "

These findings are suggestive of #platelet dysfunction#, a common cause of easy bruising and mucosal bleeding in patients with CKD. $Normally, primary hemostasis consists of the formation of a @platelet plug@.  This process begins with binding of von Willebrand factor (vWF) to the denuded endothelium after injury; vWF creates a bridge between subendothelial collagen and platelets (#adhesion#).  Platelets are then #activated# and release substances (eg, ADP, thromboxane A2) to promote #aggregation# (ie, platelet-to-platelet clumping via binding of fibrinogen to the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor). $In #CKD#, platelet function is thought to be disrupted due to #inappropriate upregulation of nitric oxide#.  Patients with CKD have elevated urea, the end product of @ammonia breakdown@, which is derived from arginine.  As urea levels rise, arginine and its precursors are shunted to a different pathway, instead producing guanidinosuccinic acid (GSA), a precursor to nitric oxide.  Inappropriately high nitric oxide levels in CKD inhibit primary hemostasis via the following mechanisms: $• #Decreased platelet adhesion:# Nitric oxide downregulates vWF secretion by endothelial cells. $• #Decreased activation and aggregation:# Nitric oxide leads to reduced levels of ADP and thromboxane A2.  In addition, it inhibits activation of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor. $Anemia in CKD (due to reduced erythropoietin production) can also contribute to platelet dysfunction by reducing platelet marginalization along the endothelial surface. $#(Choice A)#  Bruising due to atrophy of dermal collagen describes senile purpura (ie, benign purple patches on the hands/forearms in patients age ≥65); this patient's age is inconsistent with this diagnosis. $#(Choice B)#  Bleeding complications are typical of acute disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), a consumptive coagulopathy.

The patient's results show #progressive attenuation# of the intrapleural pressure (ie, progressively weaker diaphragmatic contractions) despite #no decrease in nerve activity#, which could potentially be caused by primary respiratory muscle fatigue (due to increased work of breathing from severe obstructive/restrictive lung disease) or impaired neuromuscular transmission; onset in the postpartum period is suggestive of #myasthenia gravis#, an autoimmune disorder that impacts the #neuromuscular junction#. $In myasthenia gravis, autoantibodies against postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors cause fatigable muscle weakness as #acetylcholine stores# within the presynaptic nerve terminal become progressively #depleted# with repetitive stimulation.  Although weakness in myasthenia gravis most commonly impacts the eyes (eg, diplopia), bulbar muscles, and/or extremities, it can manifest as respiratory failure (ie, myasthenic crisis), as seen in this patient. $#(Choice A)#  Impairment of the respiratory control centers in the brainstem can result in decreased frequency and/or amplitude of involuntary respirations (Ondine curse).  Voluntary breathing is unaffected. $#(Choice B)#  Nasopharyngeal lesions are unlikely to cause inspiratory airflow obstruction severe enough to cause rapid diaphragmatic fatigue because the oropharynx remains unobstructed (allowing the patient to breathe from the mouth). $#(Choices D and E)#  Metastatic disease to the pericardium could compress the phrenic nerve along its course.  In addition, the phrenic nerve can be affected by peripheral neuropathy.  However, both diseases cause uniform, weak inspirations during maximal voluntary ventilation rather than progressively weaker (ie, fatigable) diaphragmatic contractions. $#Educational objective# Progressively weakening diaphragmatic contractions during maximal voluntary ventilation with intact phrenic nerve stimulation indicate neuromuscular junction pathology (eg, myasthenia gravis) or abnormally rapid primary muscle fatigue (eg, severe obstructive/restrictive lung disease).

Critical illness, especially due to sepsis, can result in #neuromuscular weakness# caused by one or both of the following: $• Critical illness myopathy (CIM), which results in a decrease of muscle membrane excitability and loss of myosin with resultant #atrophy of myofibers# $• Critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP), which results in decreased nerve excitability (due to inactivation of sodium channels) and #axonal degeneration# (possibly due to injury to the microcirculation by inflammatory mediators) $Clinical features of CIM and CIP typically include symmetric weakness greater in #proximal#, rather than distal, muscles with #decreased deep tendon reflexes#.  It is often diagnosed when patients are unable to be liberated from the ventilator due to chest wall weakness.  Treatment is focused on controlling underlying medical conditions, preventing further complications, and rehabilitation.  Patients may improve over weeks to months with rehabilitation, but many have persistent weakness. $#(Choice A)#  Corticospinal tract demyelination can occur at multiple levels including the pons (eg, central pontine myelinolysis) or spinal cord (eg, vitamin B12 deficiency).  However, this would result in upper motor neuron signs (eg, hyperreflexia). $#(Choice B)#  Patients with sepsis have an increased risk of stroke, which can result in motor cortex ischemic injury.  However, patients with stroke often have asymmetric neurologic findings, and because it affects upper motor neurons, hyperreflexia (rather than loss of deep tendon reflexes) would be expected. $#(Choice C)#  Myasthenia gravis (MG) can lead to antibody-induced motor endplate receptor loss; myasthenic crisis can be triggered by infection and lead to respiratory failure.  However, patients with MG rarely have muscle atrophy, and deep tendon reflexes are classically preserved (MG causes fatigable weakness). $#(Choice D)#  Myofiber lymphocytic inflammation occurs with inflammatory myopathies (eg, polymyositis), which classically present insidiously (rather than over 2 weeks) with symmetrical proximal muscle weakness.  In addition, polymyositis does not typically affect the respiratory muscles, and deep tendon reflexes are usually normal. $#Educational objective# Critical illness can lead to weakness due to both myopathy (eg, atrophy of muscles) and polyneuropathy (eg, axonal degeneration, decreased nerve excitability).  This can lead to both extremity weakness and difficulty breathing due to chest wall weakness.  "

In addition, young children are particularly susceptible to febrile #viral illnesses# (eg, roseola, influenza) associated with #high fever# (≥39.5 C [103 F]), a key risk factor for development of seizures due to #hyperthermia-induced neuronal dysfunction#. $A simple febrile seizure is characterized by a generalized seizure (eg, unresponsiveness, tonic-clonic movements) that is short (<15 min) and does not recur within 24 hours.  Benzodiazepines can be used to abort seizures lasting ≥5 mins; however, most self-resolve prior to presentation.  Treatment primarily involves #antipyretics# (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), which #decrease fever# by inhibiting prostaglandin E2 synthesis and counteracting the effects of circulating cytokines, resulting in reduction of the thermoregulatory set point in the hypothalamus. $#(Choice B)#  Microbial invasion of the meningeal layers occurs with meningitis, a serious infection that may progress to encephalitis and trigger generalized seizures.  However, meningitis causes other findings not seen in this patient, such as nausea/vomiting, photophobia, nuchal rigidity, and prolonged confusion (ie, persisting after post-ictal period). $#(Choice C)#  Neuronal injury from cross-reacting antiviral antibodies describes acute cerebellar ataxia, which often occurs in children following a viral illness but presents with gait instability, impaired coordination, and tremor. $#(Choice D)#  Severe neuronal loss and gliosis in the hippocampus (ie, hippocampal sclerosis) causes mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.  Although this condition is associated with a history of childhood febrile seizures, it usually presents in young adults as focal-onset seizures (rather than generalized-onset seizures) characterized by unilateral motor symptoms, a rising epigastric sensation, and auditory/olfactory auras. $#(Choice E)#  Absence seizures are initiated by synchronized slow-wave discharge of thalamocortical tracts.  Although these seizures are more common in children with a history of febrile seizures, they are characterized by staring spells of <20 seconds, not unresponsiveness for 40 seconds with shaking movements. $#Educational objective# Febrile seizure is usually a benign neurologic disorder that occurs most commonly in children age 6 months to 5 years who have high fever due to a viral illness.

An #aura# may precede the headache in some patients and is most commonly visual (eg, scotoma) or sensory (eg, unilateral extremity paresthesia). $The pathogenesis of migraines is multifactorial with a genetic predisposition to #increased cerebral excitability#, allowing a wave of #cortical spreading depression# to propagate across the cerebral cortex.  Cortical spreading depression is likely involved in generating the pre-migraine #aura# and is associated with the abnormal activation of #trigeminal afferents#, which extend to the meninges and intracranial vasculature.  This activation results in the release of #calcitonin gene-related peptide# (CGRP), a neuropeptide involved in #pain transmission#.  CGRP also causes local vasodilation and increased neurogenic inflammation, which can further sensitize trigeminal afferents and increase pain. $The role of CGRP in migraine pathogenesis has been supported by the effectiveness of triptans ([5-HT1B/1D] receptor agonists that decrease CGRP release) and anti-CGRP antibodies (eg, erenumab) in treating migraine headaches. $#(Choice A)#  Pheochromocytoma is a catecholamine-producing adrenal medullary tumor that causes brief (<1 hr) episodic headaches associated with sweating, palpitations, and hypertension (rather than an aura). $#(Choice B)#  Amplification of epidermal growth factor receptors is associated with the development of astrocytoma and glioblastoma.  Headache and vomiting due to increased intracranial pressure are common but typically associated with other neurologic manifestations (eg, seizures, focal neurologic deficits). $#(Choice C)#  Orexin A and B are excitatory neuropeptides that are produced in the lateral hypothalamus during wakefulness and inhibit the transition to REM sleep.  Instead of episodic headaches, deficiency of these neuropeptides causes the daytime sleepiness, inappropriate bouts of REM sleep (ie, sleep attacks), and emotionally triggered transient muscle weakness (ie, cataplexy) seen in narcolepsy. $#(Choice D)#  Dysfunction of the thalamocortical fiber calcium channels can contribute to the development of absence seizures, which are brief (10-20 sec) staring episodes with impairment of consciousness, not recurrent headaches. $#Educational objective# Migraines are episodic, unilateral, throbbing headaches associated with nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light.  The pathogenesis of migraines involves a genetic predisposition to increased cerebral excitability (eg, cortical spreading depression), which leads to abnormal neuronal activation of trigeminal afferents and the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide, a vasoactive neuropeptide involved in the transmission of pain signals.

Other classic clinical features include a horizontal gaze paralysis, obtundation, and \"locked in\" syndrome, in which patients are aware but unable to move or communicate verbally. $Decreased plasma osmolality from hyponatremia (common in patients with alcohol abuse) results in water flowing across the osmotic gradient into brain cells; if this happens acutely, life-threatening cerebral edema can occur.  However, with slowly developing (chronic) hyponatremia, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes excrete osmotically active organic solutes (eg, glutamate, myoinositol) to cause compensatory intracellular water loss and normalization of brain volume.  Therefore, chronic hyponatremia can present with minimal neurologic symptoms. $However, #overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia# (eg, bolus of normal saline) reverses the osmotic gradient, drawing water from the cells into the plasma.  The astrocytes and oligodendrocytes are unable to rapidly re-accumulate the lost organic solutes, resulting in cell shrinkage, dehydration, and apoptosis.  The resultant demyelination preferentially affects the pons, possibly because the cells there are less metabolically active and less able to rapidly regenerate organic solutes. $#(Choice A)#  Vertebrobasilar atheroma formation can result in a pontine stroke with similar symptoms; however, ischemia (not demyelination) is expected on MRI. $#(Choice B)#  Septic emboli (hematogenous spread of bacteria or fungi) are typically associated with endocarditis.

Korsakoff syndrome (chronic memory impairment) can also occur.  Mamillary body atrophy is often visible on MRI. $#(Choice E)#  Paraneoplastic production of anti-neuronal antibodies can be seen in a variety of malignancies (eg, small cell lung cancer, thymoma), but symptoms are often nonfocal (eg, altered mentation, seizures).  Demyelination is unexpected. $#Educational objective# Osmotic demyelination syndrome results from overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia.

  "explanation_2": "$Voluntary facial movement is initiated by the motor cortex (located in the frontal lobe), which delivers input to the facial nerve (CN VII), a peripheral nerve that innervates the muscles of facial expression.  Central or peripheral lesions can often be distinguished by assessing movement in the upper face. $• #Central nervous system lesions# (eg, stroke) typically affect the motor cortex or the descending tracts; this results in contralateral lower face weakness.  However, the nuclei that innervate the #upper face# receive #bilateral input# from the motor cortices, so movement of the upper facial muscles (eg, forehead, brow) is often #spared#. $• #Peripheral nerve lesions# (eg, Bell palsy) affect the entire facial nerve.  This results in unilateral weakness of half of the face; #forehead movement is lost#. $The most common cause of acute unilateral @upper and lower@ facial weakness is #Bell palsy#, an acute peripheral neuropathy of #CN VII#.  Common findings include an inability to raise the eyebrow or close the eye, drooping of the mouth corner (with the mouth drawn to the unaffected side), and disappearance of the nasolabial fold.  For most patients, partial or complete recovery occurs within 3-4 months. $#(Choices A, C, and D)#  Patients with facial nerve lesions often have decreased tear production (due to loss of parasympathetic innervation to the lacrimal gland), hyperacusis (due to weakness of the stapedius muscle), and decreased sensation of taste over the ipsilateral anterior two-thirds of the tongue (which is innervated by the chorda tympani nerve, a branch of the facial nerve). $#(Choice B)#  The platysma muscle, responsible for tensing the skin on the neck, is also innervated by the facial nerve.  It would be affected in both central and peripheral lesions. $#Educational objective# Because the upper face receives bilateral input from the motor cortices, central nervous system lesions typically cause lower facial weakness that spares the forehead on one side of the face.  In contrast, peripheral lesions (eg, Bell palsy) cause weakness of the entire side of the face.  Bell palsy may also result in decreased tear production, hyperacusis, and reduced taste sensation.  ",

This #autosomal recessive# condition is caused by a defect in the ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) gene. $ATM kinase normally plays a role in the detection of DNA damage (eg, oxidative injury) through phosphorylation of various proteins, which then halt the cell cycle to allow for #DNA break repair#.  Without this surveillance mechanism, DNA is susceptible to ionizing radiation and prone to chromosomal breakage; accumulation of DNA mutations also increases the risk of malignant transformation. $Neurons are particularly prone to oxidative stress, and the first manifestations of AT are typically due to cerebellar degeneration.  #Unsteady gait# progressively worsens in early childhood, and patients often display delayed and slurred (#dysarthria#) speech.

Defective MHC class II expression (eg, bare lymphocyte syndrome) impairs T cell immune response and activation of B cells.  Patients present in infancy with severe infections and failure to thrive.  Ataxia does not occur. $#(Choice C)#  Friedreich ataxia is due to a trinucleotide (GAA) repeat expansion affecting the mitochondrial protein Frataxin.  Mitochondrial iron transport is impaired, leading to progressive ataxia in adolescents, as well as kyphoscoliosis, cardiomyopathy, and glucose intolerance.  Immune deficiency and telangiectasias are not seen. $#(Choice D)#  Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is a disorder of purine catabolism resulting from an X-linked recessive mutation in the gene encoding hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase.  This defect leads to severe hyperuricemia and gout; patients classically also exhibit self-mutilating behavior, choreoathetoid movements, and spasticity. $#(Choice E)#  Niemann-Pick disease is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective sphingolipid degradation due to a mutation in sphingomyelinase.  Motor neuropathy (eg, hypotonia, areflexia) occurs rather than ataxia, and hepatosplenomegaly and a cherry-red macular spot are typical. $#Educational objective# Ataxia-telangiectasia is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting from defective DNA break repair.

Neuronal cell body damage could potentially result in reduced signal amplitude if there is secondary axonal degeneration. $#(Choice C)#  Myasthenia gravis is due to autoimmune attack on the acetylcholine receptors of the postsynaptic membrane.  This causes fatigable weakness of the ocular, facial, and proximal muscles.  NCS is typically normal, but muscle stimulation studies demonstrate a reduction in motor signal strength with repetitive stimuli. $#(Choice E)#  Botulinum toxin blocks acetylcholine release from presynaptic membranes of the neuromuscular junction by impairing fusion of secretory vesicles with the synaptic membrane.  Patients typically develop cranial neuropathies with symmetric, descending flaccid paralysis.  NCS is typically normal; muscle stimulation studies may show a reduction in motor signal strength that improves with repetitive stimuli. $#Educational objective# Ulnar neuropathy is characterized by numbness of the fourth and fifth digits, pain, and weakness.  It is most commonly caused by compressive injury, leading to tissue ischemia and demyelination (Schwann cell injury).  A nerve conduction study can help differentiate demyelinating versus axonal neuropathies; demyelination causes slowed or blocked nerve conduction velocity whereas axonal injury leads to a reduction in signal strength.

Transected nerves undergo @wallerian degeneration@, which involves axonal dissolution while activated Schwann cells and macrophages degrade myelin.  In addition to clearing cellular debris, Schwann cells and macrophages stimulate formation of a growth cone from the proximal axon stump to facilitate #nerve regeneration#.  However, if the regenerating axons #cannot find their distal target#, regeneration can result in formation of a disorganized mass of axonal processes, Schwann cells, vascular hyalinization, and fibrosis known as a #neuroma#. $Chronic axonal injury or inflammation (such as occurs with a neuroma) induces increased expression of voltage-gated #sodium channels#, which are important for the generation and #propagation of action potentials#.  The density of voltage-gated sodium channels correlates with the excitability of nerves; therefore, the upregulated sodium channels in injured nerves and neuromas increase nociceptive (pain) sensitivity. $To support the diagnosis of a neuroma, @local anesthetic@, which blocks sodium channels in the neuronal cell membrane, is administered to prevent depolarization of the nerve.  This often provides immediate relief of pain. $#(Choice A)#  Action potential propagation depends on voltage-gated calcium channels in certain @cardiac conduction tissues@ (eg, sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes).  However, peripheral nerve depolarization is driven primarily by sodium, rather than calcium, influx. $#(Choice B)#  The influx of negative chloride ions often causes hyperpolarization, which inhibits formation of action potentials. $#(Choice C)#  Magnesium selective ion channels are not directly involved in nerve depolarization.  However, magnesium ions block calcium channels, preventing calcium influx at the axon terminal.  This impairs release of neurotransmitter vesicles into the synapse, inhibiting impulse transmission. $#(Choice D)#  The efflux of potassium out of the cell leads to @hyperpolarization@.  Therefore, upregulation of potassium channels would tend to keep the membrane potential away from the depolarization threshold, leading to less signal transmission (ie, less pain). $#Educational objective# A neuroma forms when regenerating axons are unable to find their distal target and create a haphazard mass of axons and supporting cells.  Upregulation of voltage-gated sodium channels, which generate and propagate action potentials, is likely responsible for the increased pain of these lesions.  ",

Neuronal loss begins #10-20 years prior# to the onset of typical motor parkinsonism.  During this period, known as #prodromal# or premotor PD, powerful #compensatory mechanisms# counteract presynaptic dopamine deficiency: $• In the surviving presynaptic SN neurons, de novo dopamine synthesis is stimulated by the upregulation of tyrosine hydroxylase expression and activity #(choice B).# $• In the synapse, dopamine reuptake is inhibited due to the downregulation of dopamine transporters.

Very subtle motor difficulties, especially in tasks requiring finesse and nimble movement (eg, double-clicking mouse), may be the earliest findings. $Because #nonmotor# manifestations are driven by alpha-synuclein neuronal toxicity, rather than dopamine deficiency, they are the hallmark of prodromal PD.  #Autonomic dysfunction# is common due to alpha-synuclein invasion of the enteric nervous system (gut hypomotility, #constipation#) and vascular sympathetic nerves (#orthostatic hypotension#), as seen in this patient.  Invasion of the brainstem sleep centers produces REM behavior disorder, a highly specific prodromal presentation; 90% of patients are diagnosed with an alpha-synucleinopathy within 10 years. $#(Choice A)#  Blockade of postsynaptic dopamine receptors in the basal ganglia occurs in drug-induced parkinsonism (eg, antipsychotic agents), which is clinically indistinguishable from idiopathic PD.

Symptoms correspond to the area of brain involvement; for example, #twitching/jerking# of the face or limb #(motor cortex of frontal lobe)#, paresthesia (somatosensory cortex of parietal lobe), auditory/olfactory hallucinations (temporal lobe), or visual hallucinations (occipital lobe). $• Focal impaired awareness seizures (formerly complex partial seizures): Patients appear awake but do not interact appropriately with their environment (eg, blank stare).  They frequently engage in repetitive, stereotyped actions known as automatisms (eg, lip smacking, hand wringing, repeating words). $The most common underlying cause of focal-onset seizures is a #focal structural brain abnormality# (eg, cerebral neoplasms, stroke, hippocampal sclerosis).  These seizures can remain localized or #generalize #to involve both hemispheres (focal to bilateral tonic-clonic) and are frequently associated with #postictal focal neurologic deficits# (eg, this patient's right hand weakness). $#(Choices A, D, and E)#  Diffuse cerebral hypoperfusion, neuroexcitatory substance use, and neuronal metabolic disturbances (except hyperglycemia, which can cause focal seizures) all affect the brain globally and therefore are more likely to present as a generalized seizure rather than a focal seizure.  Generalized seizures are characterized by widespread and rapid propagation of neuronal hyperexcitability without the initial localizing symptoms of a focal abnormality. $#(Choice C)#  Genetic epilepsy syndromes can have either focal seizures (eg, benign focal epilepsy of infancy) or generalized seizures (eg, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome), but these conditions typically present in childhood and persist into adulthood. $#Educational objective# Focal-onset seizures most commonly occur due to a focal structural abnormality (eg, stroke, neoplasm) that causes a region of hyperexcitable neuronal activity in one cerebral hemisphere.  These seizures begin with localized symptomatology (eg, muscle twitching, paresthesia) and are classified according to level of consciousness (eg, aware, impaired awareness).  They can progress to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures if the excitatory neuronal activity spreads to involve both cerebral hemispheres.  ",

The CTG expansion is notably unstable in #nondividing cells#, including #skeletal muscle#, the #brain#, and myocardium (repeat lengths are several-fold longer in these cells).  In addition, cellular mRNA content typically decreases with mitosis and increases when the cell is not dividing, therefore, cells that remain senescent (eg, #myocardial cells#) tend to accumulate more mutant mRNAs over time.

However, these proliferating cells (ie, airway basal cells, erythroblasts, intestinal epithelial cells, osteogenic cells) are not typically affected in DM1.  This may be due to having more stable and shorter CTG repeats, along with having less accumulation of mutant mRNAs compared to nondividing cells. $#Educational objective# Myotonic dystrophy type 1 is due to a cytosine-thymine-guanine trinucleotide repeat expansion in the dystrophia myotonica protein kinase (DMPK) gene, resulting in untranslatable mutant mRNAs.  The mutant mRNAs form hairpin structures and accumulate in the nucleus, sequestering certain RNA-binding proteins and leading to aberrant splicing.

Binding of antibodies to these receptors results in blockade of the receptor's active site, receptor internalization and degradation, and damage to the motor end plate due to complement fixation.  This leads to #decreased numbers of functional acetylcholine receptors# at the neuromuscular junction. $The decrease in the number of available cation channels reduces the end plate potential following acetylcholine release.

In skeletal muscle, this process begins with the release of calcium into the cytoplasm, which subsequently binds troponin C and induces a conformational change, allowing actin and myosin to bind.  Impaired coupling implies that an action potential occurs, but the skeletal muscle cannot contract (eg, impaired actin and myosin binding), whereas MG is caused by a failure to achieve the threshold for an action potential to occur. $#(Choices B, C, and D)#  The action potential amplitude, propagation velocity, and refractory period of the muscle cell are determined by intrinsic properties of the cell membrane.  In MG, only the neuromuscular junction is impacted, so the action potential amplitude, propagation velocity, and refractory period are normal when an action potential is actually triggered in the cell.  In contrast, the compound muscle action potential (ie, the summed action potentials of all the muscle fibers in a motor unit) decreases with repeated excitation in patients with MG due to depolarization of fewer myofibers. $#Educational objective# Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease that causes a decreased number of functional acetylcholine receptors within the neuromuscular junction.

  "explanation_2": "First-line treatment of #myasthenia gravis# (MG) is a #cholinesterase inhibitor#, such as pyridostigmine, which inhibits the degradation of acetylcholine in the neuromuscular junction, prolonging the action of acetylcholine.  Because it increases the concentration of acetylcholine, it increases the stimulation of both nicotinic receptors, which are impacted in MG, and muscarinic receptors, which are normal in MG.  Therefore, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors improve skeletal muscle weakness but can cause #muscarinic overstimulation# of the smooth muscles and excessive glandular secretions (eg, diarrhea, diaphoresis, abdominal cramping, emesis). $#Selective muscarinic antagonists# (eg, glycopyrrolate, hyoscyamine, propantheline) can be used to reduce the adverse effects of cholinesterase inhibitors in sites where acetylcholine action is mediated by muscarinic receptors (ie, gastrointestinal tract).  Because of their selectivity, these drugs improve adverse effects without affecting the action of cholinesterase inhibitors on skeletal muscle. $#(Choice A)#  Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor used primarily in the treatment of depression.  It acts in a fashion similar to the cholinesterase inhibitors in that it prolongs the activity of a neurotransmitter on its target tissue.  However, fluoxetine is otherwise unrelated to cholinesterase inhibitors or their effects. $#(Choice C)#  Pilocarpine is a nonselective muscarinic receptor agonist often used to improve symptoms of dry mouth (eg, Sjögren disease).  Use of this agent would worsen this patient's side effects. $#(Choices D and E)#  Prazosin is an alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist and propranolol is a beta-adrenergic antagonist; these agents can be used to treat hypertension.  Use of either agent does not prevent the adverse effects of a cholinesterase inhibitor. $#Educational objective# The treatment of myasthenia gravis involves the use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.  Adverse effects are related to muscarinic overstimulation, which can be ameliorated by the use of an antimuscarinic agent such as glycopyrrolate.  "

  "explanation_2": "$Ischemic neuron death (eg, stroke) typically extends beyond the borders of the primary infarction zone.  #Glutamate-induced excitotoxicity# has emerged as a key player in the outward propagation of injury.  The main events in this process are as follows: $• #Ischemic glutamate release:#  Within minutes of focal cerebral ischemia, neurons #depolarize# because of ATP depletion.  Neuronal depolarization causes exocytosis of glutamate-containing vesicles.  Clearance of glutamate is also impaired due to astrocyte dysfunction.  The result is a sudden, massive surge of glutamate into the extracellular space. $• #NMDA receptor activation:#  Glutamate enters the synaptic cleft.  The @glutamate NMDA receptor@ is activated, increasing the conductance of cations and causing depolarization (and additional glutamate release) from neurons adjacent to the infarct core. $• #Intracellular calcium overload:#  Opening of the NMDA receptors causes #calcium influx# into the cell.  Fluctuations of cytoplasmic calcium are normally buffered by the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum.  Rapid calcium overload overwhelms the cell, causing mitochondrial dysfunction, free radical formation, and calcium-dependent protease activation. $• #Neuron death:#  The neuron suffers energetic failure (mitochondrial dysfunction) and macromolecule damage (eg, membrane lipid peroxidation, DNA cleavage).  The neuron ultimately dies, ruptures, and releases more glutamate. $This vicious cycle of depolarization (excitotoxicity) and glutamate release has been identified as a final common pathway of brain tissue loss (eg, ischemic stroke, traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer dementia).  NMDA receptor antagonists (eg, memantine) have neuroprotective effects for some patients with neurodegenerative diseases. $#(Choices A and D)#  Dopamine and norepinephrine can increase neuronal calcium levels by activating calcium release from intracellular stores through the inositol triphosphate, second-messenger pathway.  This homeostatic process promotes neuron growth and survival rather than cytotoxicity.  Because these metabotropic (ie, G-protein coupled) receptors do not activate calcium channels in the plasma membrane, they do not depolarize the neuron on binding. $#(Choice C)#  Glycine is an inhibitory neurotransmitter found primarily in the spinal cord rather than the brain.  It acts on a ligand-gated ion channel that permits passage of chloride anions, causing hyperpolarization rather than excitation. $#(Choice E)#  The 5-HT3 serotonin receptor is the only isoform that acts as a ligand-gated cation channel causing depolarization; however, this is mediated primarily by sodium and potassium, rather than calcium, influx.  Furthermore, all other serotonin receptors are G-protein coupled, acting through second messengers (cyclic AMP). $#Educational objective# Glutamate is released from injured neurons, causing pathologic hyperactivation of NMDA receptors and leading to depolarization, calcium overload, and death of neighboring cells.  This cascade of excitotoxicity contributes to neurodegeneration and propagation of neuron death after focal injury.  ",

These components trigger the release of #inflammatory cytokines# (eg, tumor necrosis factor–alpha, interferon-gamma, interleukin 12), leading to loosening of the tight junctions of the blood-brain barrier, vasogenic edema, elevation of intracranial pressure, and recruitment of leukocytes. $#Streptococcus pneumoniae#, a gram-positive diplococcus, is the leading cause of acute bacterial meningitis in adults.  Initial antibiotic therapy against S pneumoniae lyses the bacteria and releases cell wall components that increase cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inflammatory cytokines.

Other forms of bacterial meningitis, such as those due to Neisseria meningitidis and Haemophilus influenzae, do not benefit from glucocorticoid pretreatment, possibly because these gram-negative organisms have thinner cell walls (less peptidoglycan and no teichoic acid), resulting in less inflammatory cytokine release. $#(Choice A)#  Therapeutic hypothermia (32-34 C [89.6-93.2 F]) can be used after hypoxic/ischemic brain injury due to cardiac arrest.  It reduces cerebral metabolic activity and limits metabolic strain within damaged neurologic tissue.

Dexamethasone reduces the inflammatory response and would be expected to decrease permeability of the blood-brain barrier. $#(Choice D)#  Glucocorticoids promote the release of granulocytes from the bone marrow and the movement of neutrophils off the endothelial wall into the systemic circulation.  This often leads to an increase in the circulating white blood cell count with delayed migration into infected tissues. $#(Choice E)#  Glucocorticoids can cause a dose-dependent increase in fasting serum glucose levels due to stimulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis and inhibition of glucose uptake in adipose tissue.  Although this increases the delivery of glucose to the brain, the primary reason glucocorticoids are protective in those with S pneumoniae meningitis is a reduction in brain inflammation. $#Educational objective# Pneumococcal meningitis is associated with massive cerebrospinal fluid inflammatory cytokine release in response to bacterial cell wall components.  Treatment with dexamethasone prior to antibiotic therapy has been shown to reduce inflammation and decrease the risk of adverse outcomes (eg, seizures, focal neurologic deficits) and death.

The spinal cord is not affected, so proprioception remains intact and ataxia does not occur. $#(Choice C)#  Lead intoxication is usually asymptomatic but can cause nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, constipation, abdominal pain) and neurobehavioral problems (eg, poor memory, difficulty concentrating).  Severe toxicity may lead to encephalopathy and ataxia, but spinal cord degeneration would not be seen. $#(Choice D)#  Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a prion disease that presents with progressive dementia and myoclonic jerks of the extremities.

Most cases are related to salicylates (eg, #aspirin#), which can cause #mitochondrial toxicity#, particularly when given to young children for virally-induced fever. $In the liver, impaired fatty acid oxidation by mitochondria leads to @fat deposition@ in hepatocytes (ie, #hepatic steatosis#), hepatomegaly, and acute liver failure.

Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), which disrupts cerebral perfusion, is a major cause of death. $#(Choice B)#  Dural venous thrombosis most commonly presents with headache in young women with hypercoagulable risk factors (eg, oral contraception).  Encephalopathy due to increased ICP can occur in severe cases, but liver function would not be affected.  This patient's age, elevated aminotransferases, and hyperammonemia make this diagnosis unlikely. $#(Choices C and D)#  Hemorrhagic necrosis of the temporal lobe is characteristic of herpes simplex virus encephalitis, which can present with altered mental status and focal neurologic deficits similar to those of an inflammatory CNS vasculitis.  However, hepatomegaly and acute liver failure would not be expected with either condition. $#(Choice E)#  Long-chain fatty acid deposition in the brain can be seen in patients with Alzheimer disease, which causes chronic dementia, not rapidly progressive encephalopathy.  Although serum fatty acids can be elevated with Reye syndrome, cerebral deposition does not occur. $#(Choice F)#  Pontine myelinolysis (osmotic demyelination syndrome) can cause confusion, lethargy, and coma but typically occurs with rapid correction of hyponatremia due to shifting of water out of brain cells.  Liver dysfunction is not associated with this condition. $#Educational objective# Reye syndrome should be suspected in a young child with acute liver failure and encephalopathy after receiving aspirin for a virus-induced fever.  Aspirin in this setting is a mitochondrial toxin that leads to hepatic steatosis, hyperammonemia, and diffuse astrocyte swelling (ie, cerebral edema).  ",

In addition, @functional residual capacity@ (FRC) (ie, the volume of air in the lungs at end-tidal expiration) is reduced. $#Mechanical ventilation# is typically needed for the management of ARDS because it allows for the application of #positive end-expiratory pressure# (PEEP).  PEEP helps treat ARDS by #opening collapsed alveoli# to reduce intrapulmonary shunting #(choice D)# and #increase FRC# back to near-normal levels.  The increase in FRC has the following beneficial effects: $• There is a critical lung capacity (ie, closing capacity) at which some of the lung's small airways collapse during expiration (due to decreased radial traction at lower lung volumes).  When FRC drops below this critical capacity, alveoli supplied by the collapsed airways are without ventilation for part of the respiratory cycle, which contributes to intrapulmonary shunting and increases ventilation-perfusion mismatching.  Increasing FRC minimizes the time spent below @closing capacity@ and in doing so #decreases ventilation-perfusion mismatching#. $• Because the FRC air volume remains in the lungs throughout the respiratory cycle, it acts as a store of oxygen that the body can pull from during brief periods of increased need.  Therefore, increasing FRC #increases the oxygen reserves# in the lungs. $#(Choice A)#  PEEP increases, rather than decreases, alveolar pressure, which has the negative effect of increasing the risk of pulmonary barotrauma. $#(Choice B)#  Intrapleural pressure is normally negative throughout the respiratory cycle due to the opposing elasticity of the lungs (tend to collapse) and chest wall (tends to expand).  Increased end-expiratory airway pressure during PEEP reduces the collapsing force of the lungs, causing the intrapleural pressure to increase. $#(Choice E)#  Minute ventilation is determined by the product of tidal volume and respiratory rate.  PEEP causes breathing to occur at a higher baseline lung volume (ie, higher FRC), but tidal volume and respiratory rate are not directly affected, and minute ventilation is unchanged. $#Educational objective# Positive end-expiratory pressure helps treat acute respiratory distress syndrome by opening collapsed alveoli to reduce intrapulmonary shunting and increase functional residual capacity (FRC).

  "explanation_2": "$In healthy persons who never smoke, lung function peaks at approximately age 30.  Afterward, there is a @gradual decline@ in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of approximately 25 mL/year.  In the average person who #smokes tobacco#, the rate of lung #function declines# approximately #3 times faster#. $Cigarette smoke contains numerous toxins (eg, formaldehyde, acrolein) that provoke# inflammatory proteolytic damage# to the airways and alveoli.  These changes are responsible for airway inflammation and narrowing (chronic bronchitis: ↑ airway resistance) and alveolar septal destruction (emphysema: ↓ elastic recoil pressure).  Together these conditions lead to expiratory flow limitation, typically measured as a# reduction in FEV1#. $Once lost, lung function is not recoverable.  However, smoking #cessation# can markedly #slow the decline# in FEV1.  Within a year of complete abstinence, a successful quitter's rate of FEV1 decline returns to that of normally aging nonsmokers.  Therefore, after this patient quits smoking, the slope of his FEV1 decline curve will decrease, but no function will be regained.  This trajectory is best represented by #Curve C#. $#(Choices A and B)#  FEV1 declines persistently with age in all individuals past age 30.  It is not physiologically possible for FEV1 to increase with further aging.  Pulmonary function decline in @normal aging@ is mostly due to a gradual, spontaneous loss of lung elastin. $#(Choice D)#  This curve represents the expected result if the patient continues smoking at his current level.  With smoking cessation, the rate of FEV1 decline would slow down rather than continue on the same accelerated trajectory. $#(Choice E)#  This curve represents further acceleration of FEV1 decline, which would occur if the patient increased his cigarette smoking. $#Educational objective# Cigarette smoking substantially accelerates the normal age-related decline of lung function that occurs after age 30.  Smoking cessation does not restore lung function that has already been lost.  However, it slows the decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second, restoring its trajectory to that of normally aging nonsmokers.  ",

COPD is characterized by chronic airway inflammation, which results in both parenchymal destruction (emphysema) and remodeling of the airways (chronic bronchitis). $The primary cell lines that are increased in the airways of patients with COPD are #neutrophils#, #macrophages#, and #CD8+ T lymphocytes#.  These cells release cytotoxic enzymes and proteases that cause alveolar damage, reduced ciliary motion, and increased mucus secretion by goblet cells.  Although more abundant, the infiltrating inflammatory cells show impaired ability to phagocytize bacterial pathogens, contributing to increased risk of respiratory infections such as community-acquired pneumonia. $#(Choice A)#  The involvement of B lymphocytes in COPD pathogenesis is controversial; however, they do not appear to have a major role, and their increased numbers may actually be protective against bacterial colonization. $#(Choice B)#  Although CD4+ T lymphocytes are slightly increased in COPD, their numbers and pathologic role are much less significant than those of CD8+ T lymphocytes; CD4+ T lymphocytes (in particular TH2 cells) play a more important role in asthma pathogenesis. $#(Choice C)#  Eosinophils play an important role in asthma but do not appear to have a major impact in COPD.  Their increased presence in patients with COPD may indicate coexisting asthma. $#(Choice D)#  Patients with mast cell disorders can have flushing, abdominal discomfort, and respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea and wheezing due to bronchoconstriction.  However, mast cells do not play an important role in the pathogenesis of COPD. $#Educational objective# Neutrophils, macrophages, and CD8+ T lymphocytes are the primary mediators of disease in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

LHF of any cause (eg, LV systolic dysfunction, valvular dysfunction) will result in #higher diastolic filling pressures#.

The remodeling is less extensive than in (primary) @pulmonary arterial hypertension@; therefore, the PH is at least partially reversible with treatment of the LHF. $#(Choices A and E)#  Hypoxia-induced vasoconstriction and emphysematous obliteration of the vasculature underlie PH that occurs secondary to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  Although there is a small component of hypoxia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction in LHF, pulmonary venous congestion is the major cause of PH. $#(Choice B)#  Congenital heart disease that causes left-to-right shunting (eg, ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect) can lead to PH via an increase in pulmonary arterial blood flow.  In LHF, PH occurs due to backwards transmission of pressure from increased pulmonary venous blood volume; pulmonary arterial blood flow remains the same or decreases as LHF worsens. $#(Choice D)#  Inflammatory large-vessel vasculitis (ie, Takayasu arteritis, giant cell arteritis) can sometimes involve the pulmonary arteries and cause PH.  However, pulmonary vascular inflammation does not play a role in PH occurring secondary to LHF. $#(Choice F)#  Thrombotic obstruction of the pulmonary arterial tree occurs in acute pulmonary embolism, and some patients can develop chronic thromboembolic PH despite receiving appropriate anticoagulation therapy.  However, this patient has no history of thromboembolic disease, and his orthopnea and crackles are more suggestive of PH due to LHF. $#Educational objective# Left-sided heart failure can cause secondary pulmonary hypertension via elevated left-sided diastolic filling pressures transmitting backward to the pulmonary veins, resulting in pulmonary venous congestion.

With pulmonary edema, the #alveoli become flooded# and unable to fill with gas (ventilation: V ≈ 0).  However, they are still being perfused (Q), resulting in many alveoli with ventilation-perfusion @(V/Q) ratios@ approaching zero. $Because blood passing through the lungs returns to the left atrium without being oxygenated, this situation is analogous to a true right-to-left anatomic shunt (eg, atrial septal defect with flow from the right to the left atrium) and is termed #intrapulmonary shunt effect#.  Increasing the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) to 100% does not improve oxygenation because the shunted blood never \"sees\" the alveolar gas.  Therefore, this patient's low arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) has #not corrected with# 100% supplemental #oxygen#. $Because pure oxygen alone cannot improve hypoxemia, treatment depends on reducing the shunt effect.  This can be done by #pressurizing# the inspired gas in a closed circuit (eg, mechanical ventilator).

It is increased, not decreased, in an intubated patient due to the extra volume of the ventilator tubing.  At any given tidal volume, increased anatomic dead space causes less air to reach alveoli with each breath, contributing to hypoventilation and worsening hypoxemia. $#(Choice C)#  When fluid enters the alveolar airspace (ie, pulmonary edema), the surface tension increases (due to dilution of surfactant) causing the alveolar walls to cling together and collapse (ie, atelectasis), which decreases lung compliance.  PEEP props open (\"recruits\") the partially flooded alveoli, improving lung compliance. $#(Choices D and E)#  PEEP raises intrathoracic pressure, which compresses pulmonary capillaries and raises pulmonary vascular resistance.  This increases pressure within the right heart chambers and can increase right-to-left shunting through an existing intracardiac shunt (eg, atrial or ventricular septal defect), worsening hypoxemia.  Therefore, PEEP is generally avoided in patients with intracardiac shunts. $#Educational objective# Severe hypoxemia that does not correct with 100% supplemental oxygen is consistent with a right-to-left shunt.  Intrapulmonary shunt effect occurs when an alveolar filling process (eg, diffuse pulmonary edema) causes poor alveolar ventilation despite continued perfusion; this improves with positive end-expiratory pressure.

This is especially true during exercise, when expiration time is limited.  Because patients with COPD require extra time for exhalation, increasing amounts of air can become trapped in the lungs during rapid breathing, leading to further reduction in tidal volume.  This is known as #dynamic hyperinflation# and is believed to be a major cause of dyspnea and exercise limitation in COPD. $#(Choice A)#  Alveolar hyaline membranes are seen in acute respiratory distress syndrome.  The pulmonary edema tends to reduce lung compliance, causing a restrictive flow-volume pattern (purple curve). $#(Choice B)#  Atelectasis due to extrinsic pulmonary compression may occur when the pleural cavity fills with air (ie, pneumothorax) or fluid (eg, exudate, blood).  Lung volumes and total lung compliance are likely reduced under such conditions, producing a restrictive flow-volume pattern. $#(Choice D)#  Diffuse intraalveolar hemorrhage tends to dilute alveolar surfactant, increasing alveolar surface tension and promoting alveolar atelectasis.  These changes would reduce lung volumes and lung compliance, resulting in a restrictive flow-volume pattern. $#(Choice E)#  Pulmonary fibrosis tends to decrease lung volume and compliance, producing a restrictive pattern.  In restrictive diseases, total lung capacity and residual volume are reduced.  The expiratory flow rate is increased relative to the low lung volumes but is reduced compared to normal peak expiratory flow rates. $#(Choice F)#  In pulmonary thromboembolism there is decreased perfusion but minimal effect on ventilation.  Therefore, the flow-volume curve will remain mostly normal. $#Educational objective# The flow-volume loop for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is characterized by increased residual volume and total lung capacity, as well as a \"scooped-out\" expiratory pattern due to reduced expiratory flow rates.  Both airway narrowing due to chronic bronchitis and decreased elasticity due to emphysematous destruction of interalveolar walls are responsible for the hyperinflation and airflow limitation.  ",

Sepsis is a florid host inflammatory response to infection that can lead to @multiple organ system dysfunction@. $Septic organ dysfunction is driven mainly by #poor tissue oxygen use#.  This cellular dysoxia is caused by 3 major mechanisms: $• Bacterial components (eg, endotoxin) and acute phase cytokines (eg, IL-1-beta) trigger production of free radicals that damage mitochondria and interfere with the electron transport chain.  Immediate postmortem analysis of patients with sepsis reveals surprisingly minimal tissue necrosis but, often, extensive mitochondrial damage.  This mitochondrial dysfunction leads to #decreased oxidative phosphorylation# with loss of ATP production.  A compensatory bioenergetic shift toward glycolysis often results in #lactic acidosis#. $• Widespread microcirculatory failure with vasodilation causes blood to shunt rapidly through organs, decreasing the opportunity for oxygen extraction. $• Increased capillary permeability causes tissue edema (third spacing), which increases the diffusion distance for oxygen to reach mitochondria of target cells. $Because oxygen use decreases, the transorgan arteriovenous oxygen gradient is small; therefore, #oxygen saturation of central venous blood# (ScvO2) (superior vena cava) – returning from the periphery – #increases#.  Central venous catheters are often placed therapeutically to deliver medications; they can be used diagnostically to differentiate septic (#↑ ScvO2#) from cardiogenic (↓ ScvO2) shock. $#(Choice A)#  Cardiac output (oxygen delivery) is typically increased in sepsis due to systemic vasodilation (warm extremities, wide pulse pressure).  Decreased cardiac output is the hallmark of severe heart failure (cold extremities, narrow pulse pressure), and ScvO2 decreases with heart failure because peripheral oxygen consumption outstrips its delivery. $#(Choice C)#  Sepsis is associated with microvascular (rather than macrovascular) thrombosis due to endothelial injury and focal or disseminated intravascular coagulation, further impairing oxygenation.  Widespread large-vessel thrombosis and infarction are seen in conditions such as catastrophic antiphospholipid-antibody syndrome. $#(Choice D)#  Sepsis can induce capillary permeability in the lung, leading to pulmonary edema with resultant arterial hypoxemia (acute respiratory distress syndrome).  However, this patient's pulmonary function and oxygenation are intact, as evidenced by normal lung examination (no crackles) and arterial oxygen saturation. $#(Choice E)#  Hemoglobin oxygen unloading to peripheral tissues is facilitated by sepsis-induced (lactic) acidosis and fever, which lead to @rightward shifting@ of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve (ie, weaker oxygen-hemoglobin binding). $#Educational objective# Sepsis is a host inflammatory response to infection that can lead to multiple organ dysfunction due to defective mitochondrial oxidative respiration, resulting in a widespread dissociation between oxygen delivery and extraction.

The resulting increase in hematocrit, known as #secondary polycythemia#, is an expected finding in conditions that cause significant chronic hypoxemia (eg, COPD, interstitial lung disease, residence at high altitude). $#(Choice A)#  Air trapping leads to an increase in the @functional residual capacity@ in patients with COPD. $#(Choice B)#  Hypoxic vasoconstriction in advanced COPD increases pulmonary vascular resistance and leads to increased right ventricular afterload. $#(Choice D)#  Airway obstruction in COPD leads to decreased expiratory flow rates.  This is apparent as reduced in forced expiratory volume in 1 second. $#(Choice E)#  Left ventricular compliance is increased in conditions that lead to eccentric left ventricular hypertrophy (eg, dilated cardiomyopathy).  It is not significantly affected in COPD. $#Educational objective# In response to chronic hypoxemia (eg advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), specialized peritubular fibroblasts in the renal cortex release erythropoietin.  This hormone stimulates red blood cell production (ie, secondary polycythemia) by the bone marrow, improving the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood.  ",

The infection causes the alveoli to fill with inflammatory, neutrophil-rich exudate (pus); alveolar filling with any kind of fluid (eg, pus, edema, blood) creates #alveolar consolidation#. $Alveolar consolidation leads to a number of characteristic physical examination findings.  Sound travels faster and more efficiently through liquids than gases; therefore, fluid-filled alveoli transmit higher intensity sound than those filled with air.  As a result, #breath sounds# and #tactile fremitus #(vibration) are #more prominent #over areas of alveolar consolidation.  #Bronchophony#, a phenomenon in which a patient's spoken words (eg, \"ninety-nine,\" \"toy boat\") are #heard more loudly and clearly# when auscultated over an area of consolidation compared to normal lung, is also present.  The higher density of fluid-filled alveoli also creates relative #dullness to percussion# compared to the resonant sound created on percussion of air-filled alveoli. $#(Choice A)#  Accumulation of interstitial fluid within the pleural space (pleural effusion) insulates breath sounds and vibrations that originate in the airways of the lungs.  Consequently, tactile fremitus and breath sound intensity are decreased.  The fluid in the chest cavity creates dullness to percussion over the affected area. $#(Choice B)#  Pulmonary embolism typically has minimal effect on physical examination findings for the lungs. $#(Choice D)#  As in pleural effusion, accumulation of air in the pleural space (pneumothorax) insulates sounds and vibrations that originate in the lungs, and breath sound intensity and tactile fremitus are decreased.  In contrast to pleural effusion, the relatively low density of the air in the pleural space creates hyperresonance to percussion. $#(Choice E)#  A mass in a proximal bronchial airway (eg, malignancy, mucus plug) can cause airway obstruction and consequent collapse (atelectasis) of distal alveoli.  Breath sounds and tactile fremitus are decreased, and dullness to percussion is created due to the absence of air. $#(Choice F)#  Transudation of interstitial fluid into the alveoli occurs in heart failure and can create alveolar consolidation with physical examination findings similar to bacterial pneumonia.  However, in heart failure the findings are typically similar bilaterally.  Pneumonia, with accumulation of inflammatory exudate, is more likely in this patient with low-grade fever and evidence of unilateral alveolar consolidation. $#Educational objective# Alveolar consolidation occurs when the alveoli become filled with fluid (eg, inflammatory exudate in bacterial pneumonia).  The increased compactness of the alveolar fluid (compared to air) causes sound to travel faster and more efficiently, resulting in bronchophony, increased tactile fremitus (vibration), and increased intensity of breath sounds over the affected area.

  "explanation_2": "$The #ΔF508 mutation# in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (#CFTR#) protein is the most common mutation in patients with #cystic fibrosis# (CF).  In unaffected individuals, the CFTR protein serves as a chloride channel that regulates the flow of sodium, chloride, and water across the epithelial membranes of the airways, biliary tree, intestines, sweat ducts, and pancreatic ducts. $Newborn screening for CF is performed in the United States, but positive results should be confirmed by #sweat testing#.  When eccrine sweat is first produced, it is isotonic with extracellular fluid.  As sweat travels through the eccrine duct to the skin's surface, chloride is normally resorbed via CFTR, and sodium and water follow.  CFTR facilitates production of hypotonic sweat in patients without CF.  However, patients with CF are unable to reabsorb chloride and sodium in the eccrine ducts and therefore secrete #sweat with high sodium and chloride# levels. $The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms (lethargy, vomiting) is #hyponatremia due to excessive salt wasting# from his sweat.  Risk factors for hyponatremia in patients with CF include exclusive breast or formula feeding prior to the introduction of sodium-rich, solid foods; exposure to high-temperature environments; and exercise.  Therefore, #salt supplementation# is recommended for patients with CF. $#(Choice A)#  Chloride ions are an important contributor to extracellular fluid volume, and hypochloremia is also very common in patients with CF due to sweat losses.  In contrast, hyperchloremia is more likely to develop in normal patients with excessive sweating due to increased free water loss from hypotonic sweat. $#(Choice B)#  Hyperkalemia typically occurs with cell lysis (eg, rhabdomyolysis, tumor lysis syndrome), metabolic acidosis (due to intracellular to extracellular K+ shift), or abnormalities with renal excretion. $#(Choice C)#  Hypernatremia classically occurs with excessive salt intake or free water loss (eg, diarrhea, diabetes insipidus, improperly prepared infant formula).  Patients with CF typically do not experience hypernatremia as they lose excess sodium through their sweat glands. $#(Choice D)#  Hypomagnesemia most commonly arises from urinary loss due to medications (eg, loop diuretics), alcohol use, or uncontrolled diabetes mellitus with polyuria. $#Educational objective# Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) produce eccrine sweat with higher-than-normal concentrations of sodium and chloride.  Exposure to high temperature or exercise can lead to hyponatremia and hypochloremia due to excessive sodium chloride loss through sweat; therefore, salt supplementation is recommended.  "

When a clot occludes the pulmonary system, the bronchial system continues to supply nutrients to pulmonary tissue and can even backfill the pulmonary capillaries to partially maintain gas exchange in the area of the thromboembolism. $Distal PEs in small arteries (≤3 mm) are more likely to cause infarction as they may occlude areas distal to the pulmonary-bronchial anastomoses.  When a pulmonary infarction does occur, it is typically #hemorrhagic# (red) rather than ischemic (white) due to the relatively low density of lung tissue and the dual blood supply. $#(Choice B)#  Alveolar inflammation triggered by PE can eventually lead to decreased surfactant and some degree of atelectasis.  This process can take up to 2 days to develop, and the resulting intrapulmonary shunting makes a small contribution to the hypoxemia that occurs with PE. $#(Choice C)#  Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) may be used to treat PE in patients who are hemodynamically unstable.  However, endothelial-derived TPA is limited primarily to the bronchial circulation, and spontaneous recanalization of the pulmonary artery is a slow process. $#(Choice D)#  PE leads to increased pulmonary arterial pressure; however, the pulmonary venous pressure is unchanged or decreased as blood flow through the proximal pulmonary circulation is obstructed.  Patients with an underlying elevation in pulmonary venous pressure (eg, decompensated heart failure) may be more likely to experience lung infarction with PE due to the high pulmonary venous pressure impairing collateral flow from the bronchial circulation. $#(Choice E)#  Intrapulmonary shunting occurs when an area of the lung is adequately perfused but poorly ventilated.  PE causes intrapulmonary shunting due to redistribution of blood away from segments directly affected by the clot; the remaining accessible alveoli are unable to fully oxygenate all the blood passing through the pulmonary circulation, resulting in hypoxemia.  In contrast, areas distal to the clot receive adequate ventilation but poor perfusion (ie, @dead space ventilation@). $#Educational objective# The lungs are supplied by dual circulation from both the pulmonary and bronchial arteries.

  "explanation_2": "#Lung abscess# is a necrotic infection of the pulmonary parenchyma that usually presents with several days of fever, cough productive of #copious sputum# (often foul-smelling), and chest x-ray evidence of @cavitation with air-fluid level@.  Most cases are due to aspiration of anaerobic bacteria from the oropharynx, but lung abscess can also develop in the setting of untreated pneumonia. $#Neutrophils# are the key player in the formation of lung abscess.  They are @recruited@ from the systemic circulation by chemokines and are subsequently activated by microbial molecules (eg, lipopolysaccharide, peptidoglycan, bacterial DNA) and opsonizing factors (eg, IgG, complement) to phagocytize and destroy the pathogenic bacteria.  Activated neutrophils also #release cytotoxic granules# (lysosomes) containing myeloperoxidase and other digestive enzymes that destroy extracellular bacteria and recruit additional immune components to the area.  However, these enzymes also cause significant damage to the pulmonary parenchyma and can result in #liquefying necrosis# of lung tissue and (potentially) lung abscess. $#(Choices A and B)#  Dendritic and other antigen-presenting cells release interleukin-12, which stimulates differentiation of Th1 helper cells and production of interferon-gamma by T-cells.  Interferon-gamma activates macrophages, leading to the development of mature phagolysosomes capable of destroying phagocytosed bacteria.  Macrophages are particularly important for the elimination of certain intracellular infections such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis.  Although tuberculosis can be associated with @pulmonary cavitation@, the cavitations usually form in the upper lobes and generally take months to develop. $#(Choice D)#  Major basic protein is the predominant component of eosinophilic granules and plays a crucial role in the elimination of parasites.  Lung abscess formation is primarily mediated by neutrophils, not eosinophils. $#(Choice E)#  Transforming growth factor-beta is secreted by inflammatory cells and results in the recruitment of fibroblasts and the deposition of connective tissue.  This cytokine contributes to scar formation after injury and plays a role in the fibrosis seen with chronic inflammation. $#Educational objective# Abscess formation is largely driven by neutrophil recruitment and activation leading to the release of cytotoxic granules that kill bacteria but also cause liquefying necrosis of surrounding tissue.

OSA is caused by @closure of the upper airway@ due to #relaxation of pharyngeal muscle tone# during sleep.  Additional contributing factors include #obesity#, tonsillar hypertrophy, and hypothyroidism.  When the airway is occluded, PO2 declines and PCO2 rises until chemoreceptors in the carotid body and brainstem trigger arousal and pharyngeal tone returns.  Sleep is repeatedly disrupted throughout the night, even in the absence of cortical awareness. $Typical symptoms include excessive daytime sleepiness, #morning headaches#, cognitive impairment, and depression.  Most patients also experience loud #snoring# due to partial closure of the airway.  Chronic OSA can lead to systemic and pulmonary hypertension with #right heart failure# and an increased risk for cardiac arrhythmias. $#(Choice A)#  Central sleep apnea is due to diminished respiratory drive from a neurologic disorder.  Symptoms may superficially resemble OSA, but it is usually associated with significant underlying chronic illness (eg, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, renal insufficiency) and is not more common in obesity. $#(Choice B)#  Narcolepsy is characterized by poorly regulated rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.  It frequently causes excessive daytime sleepiness, but patients also suffer from cataplexy, sleep attacks, hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. $#(Choice C)#  Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (Pickwickian syndrome) is caused by restricted expansion of the chest wall due to severe obesity.  This leads to hypoventilation with a chronically elevated PCO2 and reduced PO2.  This patient's normal blood gases and mild obesity are not consistent with obesity hypoventilation. $#(Choice E)#  Patients with simple insomnia may have daytime fatigue, but nonrestorative sleep, morning headaches, and elevated blood pressure suggest OSA. $#(Choice F)#  Restless leg syndrome is characterized by vague discomfort in the limbs that is brought on when trying to sleep and relieved with movement.  Symptoms may recur through the night and lead to nonrestorative sleep, but patients are usually aware of the symptoms. $#Educational objective# Obstructive sleep apnea is due to relaxation of oropharyngeal muscle tone with occlusion of the upper airway.

These changes include the following: $• #Decreased chest wall compliance:#  Calcification of the intercostal joints and tendon insertion sites, as well as degeneration of the spine (eg, kyphosis), reduces chest wall expansion and limits the potential increase in tidal volume. $• #Decreased alveolar elastic recoil#:  Degeneration of elastin causes increased alveolar compliance with alveolar enlargement and increased air trapping.

Because of the close proximity of the subclavian vein to the apex of the lung, there is risk of lung puncture during the procedure. $Lung puncture allows air to pass into the pleural space.  If the puncture is small, the patient may remain asymptomatic.  With a large puncture, air rushes into the pleural space, leading to @pressure equalization@ and #loss of intrapleural negative pressure#, which causes shortness of breath due to inability to expand the affected lung.  Intrapleural and lung pressures usually remain nearly equivalent (ie, #simple pneumothorax#), and symptoms are limited to chest pain and respiratory difficulty. $Sometimes lung puncture results in formation of a #one-way tissue valve# that opens during inspiration to allow air into the pleural space and closes during expiration to trap that air, causing intrapleural pressure to @progressively increase@ with each breath (ie, #tension pathophysiology#).  The increasing pressure leads to contralateral mediastinal shifting (eg, tracheal deviation) and #vena cava collapse#, resulting in #decreased venous return# to the heart.

This patient's tachycardia suggests that the baroreceptor reflex is intact. $#(Choice E)#  Increased intrapericardial pressure occurs in cardiac tamponade.  The increased pressure impairs diastolic filling of the right ventricle, leading to obstructive shock.  Although jugular venous distension is expected, cardiac tamponade does not explain this patient's unilaterally decreased breath sounds and tracheal deviation. $#Educational objective# Tension pneumothorax involves progressively increasing intrapleural pressure that leads to contralateral mediastinal shifting (eg, tracheal deviation) and vena cava collapse.

This leads to increased transmission of vibration and sound (ie, increased tactile fremitus and breath sound intensity) and dullness to percussion. $#(Choice G)#  Normal lung demonstrates resonance to percussion, baseline tactile fremitus, and vesicular (normal-intensity) breath sounds. $#Educational objective# Pneumothorax is recognized on chest x-ray by a continuous line without lung markings peripheral to it.

Interstitial fibrosis increases lung stiffness whereas severe obesity increases chest wall stiffness. $• #Airflow resistance# is the opposition to airflow created by limited airway diameter and turbulent airflow; it is increased at higher respiratory rates (due to faster airflow with increased turbulence) and at low lung volumes (due to reduced airway diameter).  #Obstructive lung diseases# (eg, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) increase airflow resistance due to bronchoconstriction and/or airway collapse. $To reduce the WOB, the tidal volume and respiratory rate are optimized by the respiratory control centers.

Therefore, to compensate for low lung volumes, #rapid#, #shallow breathing# is favored (as in this patient).

Because the breathing rate is higher than the normal optimal rate, the work done against airflow resistance (and total work) is increased. $#(Choice D)#  A fixed upper airway obstruction (eg, caused by a large goiter) leads to increased air flow resistance and favors slow, deep breaths to minimize the WOB. $#Educational objective# The work of breathing is minimized in patients with increased elastic resistance (eg, pulmonary fibrosis) when their respiratory rate is high and tidal volume is low (fast, shallow breaths).

ARDS is an innate immune response driven primarily by neutrophils rather than autoantibodies. $#(Choice B)#  AEP is an idiopathic form of pneumonia caused by eosinophilic invasion of the lung tissue, often with hyaline membranes, a nonspecific finding of inflammatory fibrinous edema.  ARDS also features prominent hyaline membranes, but the inflammation is driven by neutrophils rather than eosinophils. $#(Choice C)#  HP is characterized by lymphocyte-driven granuloma formation in response to extrinsic antigens (eg, mold, bird dander).

Cardiovascular manifestations include profound #vasodilation# resulting in low systemic vascular resistance and hypotension.  Refractory hypotension (ie, vasoplegia) despite adequate intravascular volume (ie, normal jugular venous pressure), as in this patient, indicates progression to #septic shock#. $Septic shock is an extreme manifestation of sepsis, in which vasodilatory mediators overwhelm endogenous vasoconstrictor mechanisms.  Key vasodilators include #nitric oxide# and prostaglandins; their production is #upregulated# by acute-phase cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α, #IL-1#, and IL-6 released from innate immune cells and endothelium exposed to bacterial cell wall glycoproteins and endotoxins #(choices C and D)#. $The normal physiologic response to hypotension is compensatory secretion of vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone) by the posterior pituitary.  In addition to promoting water retention (via renal collecting duct V2 receptors), vasopressin is one of the most potent vasoconstrictors (via arteriolar smooth muscle V1 receptors).  In septic shock, however, #vasopressin is suppressed#, possibly due to impaired baroreceptor reflexes and/or depletion of endogenous stores. $For this reason, infusion of vasopressin can be helpful during treatment of septic shock, often decreasing the need for other pharmacologic vasoconstrictor agents (eg, norepinephrine). $#(Choice A)#  C-reactive protein is an acute-phase protein produced in the liver in response to inflammation; it activates the classical @complement pathway@ and promotes phagocytosis, thereby facilitating clearance of bacteria and cellular debris.  Levels of C-reactive protein are elevated in sepsis. $#(Choice B)#  Endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) is a cell wall component of gram-negative bacteria that triggers an acute inflammatory response by binding to toll-like receptor 4 on immune cells.  The vast majority of urinary tract infections are caused by gram-negative bacteria, and nitrite production is generally exclusive to gram-negative bacteria; therefore, endotoxin concentrations are likely markedly elevated in this patient. $#Educational objective# Septic shock is a dysfunctional host response to an infectious pathogen resulting from massive upregulation of vasodilators.  A vasopressin deficit contributes to unbalanced vasodilation and refractory hypotension.  ",

In both cases, the innate immune system is activated by 2 types of danger signals: $• Pathogen-associated molecular patterns #(PAMPs)#: exogenous motifs such as bacterial cell wall products (eg, lipopolysaccharide, peptidoglycans). $• Damage-associated molecular patterns #(DAMPs)#: endogenous (ie, self) motifs released during tissue injury (eg, mitochondrial DNA, histones, hyaluronic acid fragments).

Furthermore, lipopolysaccharide is produced by gram-negative bacteria; this patient has a group A Streptococcus (gram-positive) infection. $#(Choice B)#  @Granulomatous inflammation@ involves proliferation of macrophages driven by T cells, such as with tuberculosis and sarcoidosis.  These conditions typically cause chronic lung disease developing over months (rather than acute respiratory distress) and present with nodules and lymphadenopathy (not diffuse alveolar infiltrates). $#(Choice C)#  Mast cell degranulation contributes primarily to bronchoconstriction (eg, asthma, anaphylaxis) due to release of preformed mediators (eg, histamine, prostaglandins).

  "explanation_2": "This patient with dyspnea, hypoxemia, and patchy alveolar infiltrates shortly after arriving at high altitude likely has #high-altitude pulmonary edema# (HAPE).  HAPE can occur within several days of arrival at an altitude >2,500 m (~8,000 ft), with the risk increasing as altitude increases.  The pathophysiology is driven by the #reduced partial pressure of oxygen# (PiO2) at high altitude, which leads to #hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction# and consequent #increased pulmonary arterial pressure#.  In some individuals with genetic predisposition, the hypoxic vasoconstriction is unevenly distributed, exposing the capillary beds in relatively less vasoconstricted areas to high perfusion pressure.  This causes #alveolar-capillary membrane disruption# and leads to patchy, bilateral @pulmonary edema@. $HAPE typically presents with dyspnea (progressive over 1-2 days) and cough (sometimes with hemoptysis).  Accompanying symptoms of #acute mountain sickness# (eg, headache, nausea) are often present, and physical examination reveals bilateral lung crackles.  The #hypoxemia# characteristically #improves with supplemental oxygen# (likely due to alleviation of pulmonary vasoconstriction), which differentiates HAPE from other causes of diffuse pulmonary edema.  Although potentially fatal, HAPE usually resolves rapidly upon descent to lower altitudes. $#(Choice B)#  Acute pulmonary embolism causes dyspnea and hypoxemia; however, jugular venous distension and an absence of pulmonary edema (eg, no ausculatory crackles, clear lungs on chest x-ray) are also expected. $#(Choice C)#  Hyperventilation leading to reduced PaCO2 and respiratory alkalosis is expected at high altitude.  An extreme drop in PaCO2 can cause severe alkalosis with associated tingling, numbness, tetany, and possibly seizures, but it does not cause pulmonary edema. $#(Choice D)#  Left ventricular function is unaffected in HAPE (the pulmonary edema is noncardiogenic).  Myocardial infarction can lead to acute left ventricular dysfunction with pulmonary edema, but it would be expected to present with severe chest pain and to cause jugular venous distension. $#(Choice E)#  In response to the reduced PiO2 at high altitude, the body increases erythrocyte production to increase O2-carrying capacity.  However, this secondary polycythemia does not contribute to pulmonary edema. $#Educational objective# High-altitude pulmonary edema presents with dyspnea and cough within several days of arrival at high altitude.  It is driven by reduced ambient oxygen, which leads to hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and pulmonary arterial hypertension.

This finding of severe right ventricular hypertrophy in a young woman with #progressive dyspnea# and sudden death is suggestive of #pulmonary arterial hypertension# (PAH). $@Pulmonary hypertension@ can be caused by a number of conditions, including chronic lung disease and left heart failure.  Pulmonary hypertension due to primary processes affecting the lung vasculature is referred to as PAH, a condition that most often affects women ages 20-40.  @PAH@ is characterized by intimal hyperplasia and fibrosis, medial hypertrophy, and formation of capillary tufts. $Long-standing pulmonary hypertension eventually leads to hypertrophy and/or dilation of the right ventricle (#cor pulmonale#).  Patients typically present with progressive dyspnea, exertional angina, or syncope.  As PAH progresses, signs of right-sided heart failure (eg, hepatomegaly, ascites, peripheral edema) can become prominent.  The most common cause of death in patients with PAH is right heart failure with circulatory collapse and respiratory failure. $#(Choices A and C)#  Aortic stenosis and essential hypertension cause left ventricular wall thickening and hypertrophy, not right ventricular hypertrophy. $#(Choice B)#  Dilated cardiomyopathy typically increases the size of one or both ventricular chambers.  This patient's ventricular cavities are small and normal in size, not enlarged.  Moreover, the left ventricle is relatively normal in shape (elliptical, with a long axis approximately twice that of lateral short axis dimensions), which is not the case with left ventricular dilation. $#(Choice D)#  Myocardial infarctions occur more frequently in older patients (age >65).  Morphological changes in the myocardium include an area of reddish-blue discoloration that evolves into a yellow-tan discrete infarct with eventual formation of a white scar. $#(Choice F)#  Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome should be suspected in any case of sudden cardiac death in an otherwise healthy young individual.  WPW syndrome is an electrophysiological abnormality of atrioventricular (AV) node conduction that is discernible on histology as small accessory AV impulse conduction pathway(s) anatomically separate from the AV node.  There are no consistent gross morphological changes to the ventricles. $#Educational objective# Pulmonary hypertension should be suspected in young and otherwise healthy patients with fatigue, progressive dyspnea, atypical chest pain, or unexplained syncope.  Long-standing pulmonary hypertension leads to hypertrophy and/or dilation of the right ventricle (cor pulmonale).  ",

A1AT is a serum protein secreted by the liver that @inhibits proteolytic enzymes@ (particularly neutrophil elastase) released by inflammatory cells.  The lungs use A1AT to inhibit low levels of naturally occurring proteolysis.  Without A1AT, these proteolytic enzymes go unchecked, causing #emphysematous destruction# of alveoli and the surrounding tissue, typically in a @panacinar@ pattern. $Characteristic pulmonary test findings of emphysema (from any cause) include: $• #Decreased FEV1/FVC# (ie, an obstructive ratio [≤0.7]) due to significant airflow obstruction by narrow and floppy airways (loss of supporting elastin reduces the radial traction that holds small airways open). $• Increased residual volume due to incomplete lung emptying (air trapping) and #elevated total lung capacity# (TLC) due to emphysematous tissue destruction with subsequent airspace enlargement. $• Diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (#DLCO#) tends to be #reduced# due to destruction of the alveolar capillary beds (decreased surface area available for gas exchange). $The development of emphysema (eg, lung hyperresonance) in these patients is greatly #accelerated by cigarette smoking#; even in the absence of smoking, patients with A1AT deficiency typically develop #early-onset emphysema# prior to age 50. $#(Choice A)#  Asthma is another obstructive lung disease that presents with reduced FEV1/FVC; although TLC can also be increased due to lung hyperinflation, it is more characteristic of COPD (extensive tissue destruction).  In contrast to COPD, patients with asthma sometimes develop a high DLCO (increased negative intrathoracic pressure during inspiration increases pulmonary capillary blood volume, causing additional gas uptake). $#(Choice C)#  Pulmonary arterial hypertension presents with reduced DLCO in the setting of normal spirometry and lung volumes, as the poor pulmonary capillary blood flow impairs the lungs' ability to extract oxygen (reduced DLCO); the airways and lung parenchyma are unaffected, resulting in intact lung mechanics (normal FEV1/FVC ratio and TLC). $#(Choices D and E)#  Restrictive processes demonstrate reduced lung volumes (eg, low TLC) with a normal or an increased FEV1/FVC ratio (although FEV1 and FVC are reduced individually).  The DLCO differentiates intrinsic restriction (eg, interstitial lung disease) from extrinsic restriction (eg, kyphosis, neuromuscular disease); it is decreased in the former (thickened basement membrane) and normal in the latter. $#Educational objective# Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency can induce early-onset emphysema, which is further accelerated by smoking.  Emphysema is characterized by expiratory airflow obstruction (decreased FEV1/FVC ratio), airspace enlargement and hyperinflation (increased total lung capacity), and a decreased diffusing capacity due to loss of alveolar surface area.

  "explanation_2": "#Asthma# is a disease of airway inflammation and bronchial hyperreactivity, with #variable airflow obstruction# that improves with bronchodilator medications.  Classic symptoms include cough, shortness of breath, and wheeze, although these are nonspecific.  Most patients with asthma have a chronic reduction in the FEV1/FVC ratio (≤70%; normal ~80%) due to increased expiratory airflow resistance.  However, asymptomatic patients may have normal lung function tests, with alterations in lung function occurring only during exacerbations.  This patient with intermittent shortness of breath has a normal FEV1/FVC ratio, therefore, further studies are required to exclude the diagnosis of asthma. $#Bronchial challenge testing# is a highly sensitive test with #high negative predictive value# used to assess #bronchial hyperreactivity# and exclude asthma.  A provocative stimulus (typically aerosolized #methacholine#, a cholinergic muscarinic agonist) is administered at increasing concentrations to induce bronchoconstriction.  Patients with asthma are hyperresponsive to this stimulus and experience a decline in FEV1 at lower doses than nonasthmatics.  However, the test is nonspecific and positive results may also be seen with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, and allergic rhinitis. $#(Choice A)#  Although peripheral eosinophil counts may be elevated in asthmatics, the presence of eosinophilia is not a sensitive or specific indicator of asthma and may be seen in other allergic diseases (eg, allergic rhinitis, drug reactions), parasitic infections (eg, strongyloides), and certain myeloid neoplasms. $#(Choice B)#  Most patients with asthma are sensitive to a variety of inhaled allergens, and in such patients, skin tests to various allergens will provoke a localized, immediate, type I hypersensitivity reaction.  However, patients may have allergic disease without asthma and patients with nonallergic (intrinsic) asthma may not have allergies; therefore this test is not useful for diagnosing asthma. $#(Choice D)#  During an asthma attack, the lungs may appear hyperinflated on chest x-ray.  However, chest x-rays are often normal between attacks; therefore, a chest x-ray cannot exclude asthma. $#(Choice E)#  Although serum IgE levels are generally elevated in patients with allergic asthma, patients with nonimmune-mediated asthma have normal levels of serum IgE.  Intrinsic asthma can be precipitated by pulmonary infections (especially viral), aspirin ingestion, cold air, inhaled irritants (eg, perfumes), stress, and exercise. $#Educational objective# Bronchial challenge testing is a highly sensitive but nonspecific measure that can help exclude a diagnosis of asthma.  A provocative stimulus (typically aerosolized methacholine) is administered at increasing concentrations to induce bronchoconstriction.  Patients with asthma are hyperresponsive to this stimulus and experience a decline in FEV1 at lower doses than nonasthmatics.  "

The diagnosis of CF typically is based on elevated sweat chloride concentrations, characteristic clinical findings (#recurrent sinopulmonary infections#, pancreatic insufficiency), and/or a positive family history.  However, patients with mild mutations of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene may have normal sweat testing.  In these cases, a useful diagnostic adjunct involves measuring the nasal transepithelial potential difference. $In intestinal and #respiratory epithelia#, the CFTR channel secretes chloride ions into the lumen and also has a tonic inhibitory effect on the opening of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), which decreases sodium reabsorption into the cell.  This high luminal salt content helps retain water in the lumen, forming well-hydrated mucus.  During the #nasal transepithelial potential difference# test, a saline solution is applied to the nose.  Because patients with CF have #increased sodium absorption# via the ENaC, sodium is absorbed intracellularly but chloride in the saline solution is retained in the lumen.  The higher relative amounts of negatively charged chloride on the epithelial surface result in a #more negative# transepithelial voltage difference. $CFTR channel functioning is reversed in @sweat ducts@ compared with that in respiratory and intestinal glands.  CFTR reduces the salt content of sweat by reabsorbing luminal chloride and stimulating ENaC to increase sodium absorption from the lumen into the cells.  CFTR mutations therefore result in the production of sweat with high chloride and sodium content. $#(Choice A)#  CFTR mutations lower the rate of bicarbonate secretion in the pancreatic ducts, promoting mucin precipitation and the formation of intraductal concretions that cause exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.  However, this effect is not related to the nasal transepithelial potential difference test. $#(Choice B)#  CFTR mutations impair the passive transport of chloride along its concentration gradient, decreasing chloride secretion by respiratory epithelial cells. $#(Choice C)#  The water content of mucus is decreased (not increased) in patients with CF, resulting in dehydrated mucus that predisposes to the formation of mucus plugs and chronic sinopulmonary infections. $#(Choice E)#  CFTR mutations do not significantly alter transmembrane potassium transport. $#Educational objective# In cystic fibrosis, impairment of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein reduces chloride secretion and increases sodium absorption by the respiratory epithelia, resulting in dehydrated mucus.  When saline is applied to the nasal mucosa, the increased sodium absorption in patients with CF causes a more negative nasal transepithelial potential difference, which can be used to diagnose cystic fibrosis.

  "explanation_2": "This patient has symptoms of hypercortisolism, including weight gain, weakness, and easy bruising.  She also has increased 24-hour urine excretion of cortisol and an elevated serum cortisol level that is not suppressed by low-dose dexamethasone, which confirm the diagnosis of @Cushing syndrome@.  In addition, her ACTH level is elevated (ACTH-dependent Cushing syndrome), which is most commonly due to an ACTH-secreting corticotroph pituitary adenoma (#Cushing disease#). $Initially, #excess ACTH# rapidly acts to increase adrenal blood flow and metabolic activity, primarily within the zona fasciculata and reticularis.  ACTH stimulates the transfer of cholesterol to the inner mitochondrial membrane by steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (the rate limiting step in steroid production) and its conversion to pregnenolone by cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme.  Increased pregnenolone availability results in #increased cortisol synthesis# within the zona fasciculata and #increased androgen production# within the zona reticularis (can lead to irregular menstruation, hirsutism).  ACTH also has a trophic (growth) effect on the #zona fasciculata and reticularis#; as time passes, high levels of ACTH upregulate RNA and protein synthesis and induce cellular proliferation (#hyperplasia#). $#(Choice A)#  Although increased ACTH can have a transient effect on aldosterone production, angiotensin II is the primary trophic hormone for the zona glomerulosa.  Adenoma or nodular hyperplasia of the zona glomerulosa can be associated with increased secretion of mineralocorticoids (primary hyperaldosteronism [Conn syndrome]), which presents with hypertension and hypokalemia (muscle weakness). $#(Choice B)#  Atrophy of the entire adrenal cortex is most commonly caused by autoimmune adrenalitis and presents with chronic adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease).  There is a compensatory rise in ACTH secretion, but, unlike in this patient, urine cortisol excretion is not elevated. $#(Choices C and E)#  Pheochromocytoma is a catecholamine-secreting tumor derived from the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla.  Adrenal medullary hyperplasia is a rare disorder that may be a precursor to pheochromocytoma.  These disorders typically present with symptoms of catecholamine excess (eg, palpitations, diaphoresis) and episodic hypertension.  Patients have elevated blood and urine levels of catecholamines rather than cortisol. $#Educational objective# ACTH is the major trophic hormone of the zona fasciculata and reticularis, whereas the zona glomerulosa is primarily regulated by angiotensin II.  Excess production of ACTH causes increased cortisol synthesis within the zona fasciculata (@Cushing's@ manifestations) and increased androgen production within the zona reticularis (irregular menstruation, hirsutism in women).

  "explanation_2": "This patient has hypertension and likely #type 2 diabetes mellitus#.  The primary defects in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes include #defective insulin secretion# from pancreatic beta cells and #insulin resistance# in peripheral tissues.  Insulin resistance is caused by a number of genetic (eg, insulin receptor and postreceptor mutations) and environmental factors (eg, lack of physical activity, obesity). $An adipose body habitus is commonly associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.  In particular, excess #visceral fat# (surrounding internal organs) correlates much more strongly with insulin resistance than does subcutaneous fat.  Measurement of #waist circumference# or #waist-to-hip ratio# is an effective indirect assessment of visceral fat, especially in patients who are overweight (BMI 25-29.9 kg/m2) or mildly obese (BMI 30-34.9 kg/m2).  A waist circumference >102 cm (40 in) in men and >88 cm (35 in) in women is associated with a higher risk of insulin resistance. $The association of insulin resistance, increased visceral adiposity (ie, increased waist circumference), hypertension, and serum lipid abnormalities (high triglyceride levels, low HDL levels) is known as #metabolic syndrome# (sometimes called syndrome X).  Patients with metabolic syndrome have increased rates of #cardiovascular events# and warrant careful risk factor management. $#(Choice A)#  Insulin suppresses gluconeogenesis and promotes glycogen synthesis in the liver.  In patients with insulin resistance, the inhibitory effect of insulin on gluconeogenesis is reduced, leading to increased hepatic glucose production. $#(Choice B)#  High LDL levels are an independent risk factor for atherosclerotic heart disease in patients with diabetes, but are not directly associated with increased insulin resistance.  In contrast, insulin resistance is associated with high triglyceride and low HDL levels. $#(Choice C)#  High urinary excretion of ketones suggests absolute insulin deficiency, as seen in type 1 diabetes, rather than insulin resistance.  Patients with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance typically have high circulating insulin levels that are more than adequate to suppress ketone formation. $#(Choice D)#  Skeletal muscle is a major repository for ingested glucose due to insulin-mediated glucose uptake.  In patients with insulin resistance, decreased glucose uptake in skeletal muscle leads to reduced glycogen synthesis and higher blood glucose levels. $#Educational objective# Visceral obesity as measured by waist circumference or waist-to-hip ratio is an important predictor of insulin resistance.

Bilateral adrenal hyperplasia is the most common cause, followed by a unilateral adrenal adenoma. $#Aldosterone#, which is normally regulated by angiotensin II and K+ levels, stimulates reabsorption of sodium (Na+) and secretion of potassium (K+) and hydrogen (H+) in the renal collecting ducts.  Excess aldosterone causes Na+ retention, hypertension, and feedback suppression of the renin-angiotensin system (ie, #low renin activity#).  Some patients also develop metabolic alkalosis and #hypokalemia#.  Symptomatic hypokalemia may cause #muscle weakness#, cramps, and, occasionally, rhabdomyolysis and cardiac arrhythmias. $Despite increased Na+ reabsorption, extravascular volume overload (eg, peripheral edema) is rarely seen due to a phenomenon known as @aldosterone escape@.  With aldosterone escape, increased intravascular volume increases pressure natriuresis and augments atrial natriuretic peptide release, thereby limiting net Na+ retention and extravascular volume overload.  Hypernatremia is also not typically seen because the temporary increase in serum osmolality triggers a compensatory rise in antidiuretic hormone release. $#(Choices A and B)#  Pheochromocytomas are catecholamine-secreting tumors arising from the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla or extraadrenal sympathetic chain that typically present with severe hypertension.  Pheochromocytomas stimulate the renin-angiotensin system due to high circulating catecholamine levels and are associated with tachycardia and symptoms of catecholamine excess (eg, sweating, palpitations, headache). $#(Choice C)#  Increased renin production by the juxtaglomerular apparatus leads to hypertension with elevated aldosterone levels.  This typically occurs in the setting of renal artery stenosis due to decreased renal blood flow.  However, this patient's renin activity is suppressed. $#(Choices D and F)#  Hypersecretion from cells of the zona fasciculata or zona reticularis would lead to Cushing syndrome or hyperandrogenism, respectively.  Cushing syndrome can cause hypertension and hypokalemia but is usually associated with weight gain and a cushingoid body habitus (eg, central obesity, moon facies).  Clinical manifestations of adrenal hyperandrogenism are typically minimal in men because androgen levels are already high due to testicular testosterone production. $#Educational objective# Primary hyperaldosteronism is caused by excessive aldosterone secretion, typically due to an aldosterone-producing adrenal adenoma or bilateral nodular hyperplasia of the zona glomerulosa.

However, hypotension in adrenal crisis is often refractory to vasopressors because glucocorticoids have a permissive effect on vasoconstriction. $#(Choice E)#  Clinical features of hypothyroid crisis may include hypoglycemia and hypotension, as seen in this patient, but would usually also include altered sensorium, hypothermia, bradycardia, and hypoventilation.  In addition, due to the long plasma half life of levothyroxine, missing 2 days of therapy would be unlikely to cause a symptomatic drop in thyroid hormone levels. $#Educational objective# Patients with adrenal insufficiency are not able to increase glucocorticoid production in response to acute stress (eg, illness, surgery).

However, these conditions are commonly seen in older individuals (age >50-60). $#(Choice C)#  Loss of sensation in the perineal area (saddle anesthesia) can indicate cauda equina syndrome, which is commonly due to epidural cord compression from a malignancy.  Patients usually develop urinary retention late in the course of the disease, usually associated with fecal incontinence. $#(Choices D and E)#  Cognitive impairment (mini-mental status examination score ≤ 22) is often seen in normal pressure hydrocephalus, and lower extremity hyperreflexia would suggest spinal cord disease.  Both of these conditions can cause loss of central nervous system inhibition of detrusor contraction, leading to urge incontinence.  Urge incontinence is characterized by a sudden desire to urinate.  However, absence of other symptoms (eg, gait disturbance) in this patient makes these conditions less likely. $#Educational objective# Diabetic autonomic neuropathy is common in type 1 diabetics and can cause overflow incontinence due to inability to sense a full bladder and incomplete emptying.  Postvoid residual (PVR) testing with ultrasound or catheterization can confirm inadequate bladder emptying.  "

Enzyme deficiency causes the #buildup of 17-OHP#, which is then shunted toward androgen production. $Deficiency of 21-hydroxylase can result in varying clinical phenotypes depending on the amount of residual enzyme available.

It is not commonly associated with SAH. $#(Choice B)#  Impaired renal concentrating ability is seen in diabetes insipidus (DI), which occurs either due to ADH resistance (nephrogenic DI) or decreased ADH production (central DI).  DI may follow cerebral injury; however, it does not cause hyponatremia.  Rather, DI results in a clinical picture opposite that of SIADH, featuring hypernatremia, increased serum osmolality, and dilute urine (ie, low urine osmolality). $#(Choice C)#  Inadequate dietary intake of sodium is a rare cause of hyponatremia primarily seen in cases of chronic alcohol abuse (eg, beer potomania).  SIADH is a more likely cause of hyponatremia in this patient. $#Educational objective# Hyponatremia following cerebral injury (eg, subarachnoid hemorrhage) is most commonly due to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion.

Somatostatin is now known to be secreted from other parts of the central nervous system and from pancreatic delta cells.  Somatostatin secreted from pancreatic \"delta cells\" decreases the secretion of secretin, cholecystokinin, glucagon, insulin, and gastrin.  Somatostatinomas are rare pancreatic islet cell tumors that arise from delta cells.

However, the secretion of insulin is more profoundly inhibited than is glucagon; therefore, the net result is hyperglycemia. $#(Choice A)#  Steatorrhea results from the decreased secretion of secretin as well as a decrease in gastrointestinal motility. $#(Choice E)#  A decrease in gastrin release causes hypochlorhydria. $#(Choice F)#  As indicated above, somatostatin does decrease growth hormone secretion from the normal pituitary gland, and it does so in growth-hormone-secreting pituitary adenomas.

  "explanation_2": "$Like most hormones, secretion of cortisol is regulated via a @negative feedback loop@.  Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is secreted by the hypothalamus in response to stress and circadian signals received from other parts of the central nervous system.  CRH stimulates ACTH release by the pituitary, which in turn increases cortisol secretion by the adrenal cortex.  High cortisol levels suppress secretion of ACTH and CRH, and low cortisol levels cause an increase in ACTH and CRH secretion. $Although not commonly used, the #metyrapone stimulation test# is a sensitive indicator of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis integrity.  Metyrapone blocks cortisol synthesis by inhibiting #11-β-hydroxylase#, which converts #11-deoxycortisol to cortisol# in the @zona fasciculata@.  Because 11-deoxycortisol lacks glucocorticoid activity, it does not inhibit pituitary ACTH secretion.  As a result, the reduction in cortisol levels following metyrapone administration cause an increase in pituitary ACTH secretion.  This leads to increased production of 11-deoxycortisol, which is further metabolized by the liver to #17-hydroxycorticosteroids# that accumulate in the urine. $Serum 11-deoxycortisol and urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroid levels will normally rise in response to metyrapone, indicating an intact HPA axis.  Failure of these steroid levels to increase implies primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency, which can be distinguished based on plasma ACTH levels. $#(Choices B and D)#  The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system regulates aldosterone synthesis by the zona glomerulosa.  Because metyrapone inhibits 11-β-hydroxylase, aldosterone synthesis will decrease.  However, accumulation of the aldosterone precursor 11-deoxycorticosterone (a weak mineralocorticoid) prevents the development of mineralocorticoid deficiency, so renin levels will not change significantly. $#(Choice C)#  The inhibition of 11-β-hydroxylase by metyrapone would lead to a decrease in cortisol, not an increase. $#(Choice E)#  Vasopressin is a hormone secreted by the posterior pituitary that is responsible for regulating water balance.  Additionally, vasopressin acts as a potentiator for CRH, enhancing the release of ACTH.  However, there is no clear feedback loop between cortisol and vasopressin; therefore, metyrapone administration is unlikely to lead to vasopressin overproduction. $#Educational objective# Administration of metyrapone will cause a decrease in cortisol synthesis via inhibition of 11-β-hydroxylase.  In patients with an intact hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, this will cause a reactive increase in ACTH, 11-deoxycortisol, and urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroid levels.  ",

Endocrine dysfunction is due to pancreatic fibrosis and fat infiltration, which cause progressive encroachment, disruption, and #destruction of pancreatic islet cells#.  This injury results in #decreased insulin production# and #CF-related diabetes# (CFRD).  In the initial stages, glucose is typically normal when fasting (ie, able to produce some insulin) but elevated after a glycemic load, as seen in this patient.  As the disease progresses, there is fasting hyperglycemia and increasing hemoglobin A1c levels. $Because early diagnosis and treatment with insulin are associated with improved pulmonary status and overall survival, all CF patients should undergo regular screening with oral glucose tolerance tests. $#(Choice B)#  Decreased insulin production due to pancreatic islet cell autoantibodies describes the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes mellitus.  Islet cell destruction in CFRD is not an autoimmune process. $#(Choice C)#  Although glucagon increases in response to starvation, chronic malnutrition is likely to result in glucagon resistance.  In addition, glucagon-producing alpha islet cells are damaged along with beta cells in patients with CF, resulting in decreased glucagon secretion. $#(Choices D and E)#  Stress-induced hyperglycemia and insulin resistance can occur in times of acutely increased metabolic demand (eg, trauma, burn, sepsis) due to the release of cortisol, epinephrine, and glucagon.  Patients with late-stage CFRD may have a component of insulin resistance during times of acute stress and inflammation (eg, pulmonary exacerbation); however, this is not the primary mechanism of CFRD. $#Educational objective# Cystic fibrosis (CF) causes the accumulation of thick, viscous secretions in ducts throughout the body.  CF-related diabetes occurs after the progressive destruction of pancreatic islet cells leads to decreased insulin production.  ",

  "explanation_2": "Excessive male-pattern hair growth in a woman is called #hirsutism#.  Hirsutism can be due to increased androgen production (eg, polycystic ovary syndrome, Cushing syndrome, ovarian and adrenal tumors), increased local conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), or higher sensitivity of hair follicles to DHT (eg, idiopathic hirsutism).  With excessive androgen exposure, soft, non-pigmented villous hair changes to coarse pigmented terminal hair in androgen-dependent areas of the body (eg, face, chest, back).  #Virilization #occurs with very high androgen levels and is characterized by clitoromegaly, increased muscularity, and voice deepening in addition to hirsutism. $The most common cause of hirsutism is #polycystic ovary syndrome #(PCOS), which is often associated with elevated androgen levels.  Combination oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) are usually the first choice for treating hirsutism in PCOS.  OCPs work by suppressing LH secretion from the pituitary, thereby decreasing ovarian androgen production.  They also increase sex hormone-binding globulin synthesis by the liver, decreasing free testosterone levels. $#(Choice A)#  Ornithine decarboxylase is involved in DNA stabilization and repair.  Inhibition leads to decreased cell growth and increased apoptosis.  Eflornithine is a topical ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor used to decrease the rate of facial hair growth. $#(Choice C)#  Patients with PCOS who develop diabetes mellitus are usually treated with metformin, which increases insulin sensitivity.  Metformin can also help normalize menses but would not improve hirsutism. $#(Choices D and E)#  Testosterone receptor antagonists (eg, spironolactone) are effective in suppressing androgen-dependent hair growth.  5-α-reductase inhibitors (eg, finasteride) decrease peripheral conversion of testosterone to DHT but are less effective than testosterone receptor antagonists in treating hirsutism.  Both are strongly teratogenic. $#Educational objective# Male-pattern hair growth in a woman is called hirsutism; the most common cause is polycystic ovary syndrome.  Combination oral contraceptive pills can treat hirsutism by suppressing pituitary LH secretion and subsequently decreasing ovarian androgen production.  "

The most common cause of CAH is #21-hydroxylase# #deficiency#, accounting for 90% of all cases.  This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of #progesterone to 11-deoxycorticosterone# (aldosterone precursor) in the zona glomerulosa, and 17-hydroxyprogesterone to 11-deoxycortisol (cortisol precursor) in the zona fasciculata. $In 21-hydroxylase deficiency, the adrenal gland cannot synthesize aldosterone and cortisol efficiently.  ACTH levels increase as a result of low cortisol levels, stimulating #increased adrenal androgen# production by diverting the accumulating aldosterone and cortisol precursors toward the androgen biosynthetic pathway.  Genetic females (46,XX) affected with @classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency@ are usually identified at birth as increased androgen levels lead to ambiguous genitalia (#virilization#).  However, genetic males (46,XY) have normal genitalia and therefore typically present later with symptoms of #salt-wasting# or precocious puberty. $Infants with 21-hydroxylase deficiency are often detected during routine newborn screening, and a high serum level of #17-hydroxyprogesterone# confirms the diagnosis. $#(Choice A)#  Side-chain cleavage enzyme catalyzes the conversion of cholesterol into pregnenolone.  Lack of this enzyme leads to absent steroid hormone synthesis.

Although deficiency of this enzyme can result in adrenal insufficiency and ambiguous genitalia (in both sexes), it is a very rare cause of CAH. $#(Choice D)#  Synthesis of 17-hydroxyprogesterone from progesterone is catalyzed by @17α-hydroxylase@.  Deficiency of this enzyme causes mineralocorticoid excess and impaired androgen synthesis.  Genetic males have ambiguous genitalia, whereas genetic females appear phenotypically normal. $#(Choice E)#  @5α-reductase deficiency@ prevents the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, the hormone responsible for the development of male external genitalia.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus is caused by autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells and is associated with an increased risk of other autoimmune endocrinopathies.  Autoimmune adrenalitis is the most common cause of primary adrenal insufficiency and results from autoantibodies against all 3 zones of the adrenal cortex.  Because the main defect is in the adrenal gland, #exogenous ACTH# administration #does not increase cortisol# levels.  Decreased negative feedback of cortisol on the pituitary gland increases release of ACTH and melanocyte-stimulating hormone, resulting in #hyperpigmentation#.  Affected diabetic patients often develop #reduced insulin requirements# due to decreased appetite, weight loss, and increased insulin sensitivity (glucocorticoids decrease insulin sensitivity). $Hypoaldosteronism in primary adrenal insufficiency leads to decreased Na+ reabsorption and decreased urinary excretion of K+ and H+.  Decreased H+ excretion causes a nonanion gap metabolic acidosis with low plasma HCO3-.  This leads to compensatory Cl- retention to maintain electrical neutrality of the extracellular fluid.  The hypotension induced by lack of aldosterone stimulates vasopressin release, increasing free water reabsorption and further exacerbating hyponatremia.  As a result, patients with primary adrenal insufficiency present with #hyponatremia#, #hyperkalemia#, hyperchloremia, and #nonanion gap metabolic acidosis#. $#(Choice A)#  Mineralocorticoid excess (ie, primary hyperaldosteronism) leads to Na+ retention, urinary loss of K+ and H+, and metabolic alkalosis (ie, increased plasma HCO3-).  However, significant hypernatremia is avoided due to @aldosterone escape@. $#(Choice C)#  Thiazide diuretics block Na+/Cl- reabsorption in the distal tubule.  This allows more Na+ to reach the collecting tubule, enhancing K+ and H+ excretion.  Findings include hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis. $#(Choice D)#  Isolated hyperkalemia is usually due to excess dietary potassium intake or cell lysis (eg, hemolysis, rhabdomyolysis).  Hyperkalemia can also be caused by decreased shift of K+ into the cells due to insulin deficiency or occasionally by beta-2 antagonists (eg, propranolol). $#(Choice E)#  Normal serum sodium in the setting of hypokalemia and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis suggests distal hypokalemic or proximal renal tubular acidosis. $#Educational objective# Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus are at increased risk for other autoimmune endocrinopathies, including primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease).

Common nonreproductive manifestations include intellectual and language impairment. $Klinefelter syndrome is the most common cause of male hypogonadism and is characterized by progressive destruction and hyalinization of the seminiferous tubules, leading to small, firm testes.  Serum #inhibin levels are decreased# as a result of the Sertoli cell damage; Leydig cells are usually dysfunctional as well, resulting in #reduced testosterone# levels.  The loss of @feedback inhibition@ leads to #increased FSH and LH secretion#.  Gynecomastia is caused by an increased ratio of estrogens to androgens (high gonadotropin levels increase aromatase activity, which increases conversion of testosterone to estradiol). $#(Choice A)#  Hypogonadotropic (central) hypogonadism is caused by injury or dysfunction of the hypothalamus (eg, Kallmann syndrome) or pituitary gland (eg, adenomas).  LH, FSH, and testosterone levels are all low, and spermatogenesis is impaired.  Unlike in this patient, testes in central hypogonadism are atrophic and soft (not hyalinized and firm), and gynecomastia is uncommon because the decrease in gonadotropins reduces aromatase activity. $#(Choice B)#  Azoospermia associated with a normal hormonal profile suggests an obstruction along the path from the testes to the seminal fluid (eg, congenital absence of the vas deferens in cystic fibrosis).  In these patients, the testes and breasts are grossly normal. $#(Choice C)#  Decreased LH, normal FSH, and elevated testosterone in the setting of a low sperm count suggest exogenous testosterone use.  High androgen levels suppress LH secretion, decreasing endogenous testosterone production.  Despite the high circulating levels of exogenous androgen, these patients have a low sperm count because local androgen concentrations in the seminiferous tubule are suboptimal for spermatogenesis.  Over time, this leads to atrophy of the seminiferous tubules and soft, small testes. $#(Choice E)#  Normal LH and testosterone, elevated FSH, and a low sperm count can be seen in patients with cryptorchidism.  In this condition, the seminiferous tubules are damaged (resulting in elevated FSH levels), and the interstitial Leydig cells are preserved (maintaining normal LH and testosterone levels). $#Educational objective# Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY) causes infertility characterized by primary hypogonadism (elevated FSH and LH, low testosterone) and azoospermia.

  "explanation_2": "$This young patient has both clinical (eg, polyuria, polydipsia, volume depletion) and biochemical (eg, hyperglycemia, low bicarbonate, high anion gap, decreased serum sodium levels) signs of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).  DKA is often precipitated by infections, including urinary tract infections (likely in this patient).  Patients with DKA lose significant amounts of potassium in the urine, primarily via glycosuria-induced osmotic diuresis and hypovolemia-mediated increase in aldosterone secretion.  This results in a #total body potassium deficit# that is reflected by decreased intracellular potassium stores (since 98% of the body's potassium is stored intracellularly).  Despite the low intracellular potassium levels, #extracellular potassium concentrations are normal or increased# due to the following mechanisms:  $1. Loss of intracellular free water caused by increased plasma osmolality leads to extracellular movement of potassium secondary to increasing intracellular potassium concentration  $2. Lack of insulin also causes extracellular shifting of potassium as insulin normally promotes cellular uptake of potassium $Clinicians must be careful when giving insulin and intravenous fluids during resuscitation of dehydrated, hyperglycemic patients.  These interventions force potassium back into the cells, causing a precipitous drop in serum potassium due to the total body deficit.  Despite normal or elevated serum potassium, timely administration of potassium supplementation is essential when treating a patient with DKA. $#(Choice A)#  A decrease in both intra- and extracellular potassium levels is seen with mineralocorticoids excess, diuretic use, and chronic gastrointestinal losses. $#(Choice B)#  Extracellular potassium concentration decreases following glucose and insulin administration as potassium moves into the intracellular compartment.  Stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors also causes increased transfer of potassium to the intracellular compartment. $#(Choice D)#  Renal excretion of potassium is impaired in most patients with chronic renal failure, resulting in increased total body potassium storage and hyperkalemia. $#(Choice E)#  Normal extracellular potassium levels are common in patients with DKA as the extracellular potassium shift is often mitigated by increased urinary potassium losses.  However, intracellular potassium levels are always decreased in DKA. $#Educational objective# Most patients with diabetic ketoacidosis have normal to increased serum potassium levels despite a total body potassium deficit.  Replacement of potassium is a crucial step in the management of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis.  "

  "explanation_2": "$This patient has hyperparathyroidism, presenting with #osteoporosis# and nephrolithiasis associated with mild #hypercalcemia# and an inappropriately #elevated parathyroid hormone# (PTH) level. $PTH increases bone turnover by stimulating the differentiation and activity of osteoblasts, leading to increased bone formation.  In addition, PTH upregulates the expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANK-L) on the surface of the activated osteoblasts, which binds RANK on nearby osteoclast precursor cells and induces maturation to active osteoclasts.  Therefore, #PTH #causes #bone formation# (by direct effect on osteoblasts) and #bone resorption# (by paracrine effect on osteoclasts).  @Bone turnover@ is normally #balanced#, with bone formation proportionate to resorption. $In #hyperparathyroid states#, continuous exposure to high PTH levels cause increased RANK-L expression along with suppression of osteoprotegerin (a counterregulatory decoy receptor).  This leads to greater bone resorption than formation and #net bone loss#. $#(Choices A and D)#  PTH upregulates 1-alpha-hydroxylase in the kidneys, which leads to increased (not decreased) conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (calcidiol) to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol).  Calcitriol subsequently induces increased (not decreased) intestinal calcium absorption. $#(Choice B)#  PTH increases renal reabsorption of calcium.  Despite this, hypercalciuria is common in hyperparathyroidism because the filtered calcium load may exceed renal reabsorption capacity.  However, the local concentrations of calcium in the bone remain elevated, and urinary calcium wasting is not a major contributor to bone loss. $#(Choice C)#  Supraphysiologic glucocorticoid (eg, prednisone) doses can cause osteoporosis, in part due to decreased proliferation and differentiation of osteoblast precursor cells.  PTH increases the differentiation of osteoblast precursors; osteoporosis occurs in hyperparathyroidism because of a proportionally greater increase in osteoclast activity. $#Educational objective# Parathyroid hormone directly stimulates osteoblasts, leading to increased bone formation.  Expression of RANK-L on osteoblasts induces increased bone resorption via a paracrine effect on nearby osteoclasts.  Hyperparathyroidism causes increased RANK-L expression and decreased expression of osteoprotegerin, leading to net bone loss.  ",

These findings, along with suppressed plasma renin, suggest #primary hyperaldosteronism# (ie, mineralocorticoid excess).  Primary hyperaldosteronism is most commonly caused by a unilateral #adrenal adenoma# (Conn syndrome) or bilateral adrenal hyperplasia (idiopathic hyperaldosteronism). $Hyperaldosteronism is characterized by increased distal @Na+ reabsorption@ in the renal collecting ducts.  This creates a negative charge in the lumen, pulling H+ and K+ from tubular cells and leading to their urinary excretion.  As a result, #hypokalemia# is common.  Increased H+ excretion by alpha-intercalated cells promotes bicarbonate production and increased activity of the basolateral HCO3−/Cl− exchanger, resulting in elevated serum bicarbonate and #metabolic alkalosis (choice E).# $Despite increased Na+ reabsorption, overt volume overload (eg, pedal edema) is rarely seen due to a phenomenon known as #aldosterone escape#.  Increased intravascular volume increases pressure natriuresis and augments atrial natriuretic peptide release, thereby limiting net sodium retention and overt volume overload.  Hypernatremia is also not typically seen because the temporary increase in serum osmolality triggers a compensatory rise in antidiuretic hormone (ADH) release. $#(Choice A)#  Loop or thiazide diuretic use can cause metabolic alkalosis, hypokalemia, and hyponatremia (mostly with thiazides) due to urinary losses of H+, K+, and Na+.  Na+ loss leads to hypovolemia, which can exacerbate hyponatremia (due to nonosmotic stimulus for ADH secretion) and alkalosis (due to increased bicarbonate reabsorption). $#(Choice C)#  Primary adrenal insufficiency reduces urinary excretion of H+ and K+ and promotes renal Na+ loss due to low aldosterone.  As a result, metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, and hypovolemia develop. $#(Choice D)#  Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (eg, spironolactone) block aldosterone receptors, thereby impairing urinary excretion of H+ and K+.  Common adverse effects therefore include metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia.  Na+ excretion is only mildly increased, and serum Na+ concentration is usually not significantly affected. $#Educational objective# Primary hyperaldosteronism increases distal Na+ reabsorption (secondary hypertension), leading to increased urinary excretion of H+ and K+ (metabolic alkalosis and hypokalemia).  Overt volume overload is not seen due to aldosterone escape, and serum Na+ concentration is typically normal due to preserved antidiuretic hormone function.  ",

Blood pressure and electrolytes are unaffected. $#(Choice B)#  @11 beta-hydroxylase deficiency@ causes decreased glucocorticoid synthesis and increased production of adrenal androgens.  Because the production of 11-deoxycorticosterone (weak mineralocorticoid) is also increased, individuals with this deficiency have features of mineralocorticoid excess (eg, hypertension, hypokalemia).  However, genetic males appear phenotypically normal. $#(Choice D)#  20,22-desmolase (side chain cleavage enzyme) deficiency results in impaired synthesis of all steroid hormones with accumulation of cholesterol esters in the adrenal glands and gonads.  Complete deficiency is lethal, and partial deficiency typically presents in infancy with signs of adrenal insufficiency (eg, hypotension, hyperkalemia). $#(Choice E)#  The most common form of CAH is @21-hydroxylase deficiency@.  It causes decreased glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid synthesis and increased adrenal androgen production.  In contrast to this patient, genetic males with 21-hydroxylase deficiency appear phenotypically normal. $#Educational objective# Deficiency of 17 alpha-hydroxylase is a rare form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia characterized by impaired synthesis of androgens, estrogens, and cortisol with excess production of mineralocorticoids.  Genetic males with this deficiency may have phenotypically female external genitalia and present with hypertension and hypokalemia around the expected time of puberty.  ",

Glucagon-induced glycogenolysis is the predominant initial means of rapidly increasing blood glucose levels during hypoglycemia. $Glucagon functions by stimulating G protein–coupled receptors on hepatocytes, increasing intracellular cAMP concentration and activating protein kinase A.  This leads to activation of the key glycogenolytic enzyme, glycogen phosphorylase.  It also stimulates gluconeogenesis by activating rate-limiting gluconeogenetic enzymes (eg, pyruvate carboxylase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase) and decreasing intracellular fructose-2,6-bisphosphate levels (inhibiting glycolysis). $#(Choices A, B, and F)#  Epinephrine from the adrenals increases glucose by multiple mechanisms, including increased glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in the liver and decreased glucose uptake by skeletal muscle.  Epinephrine also causes increased alanine release from skeletal muscle, which serves as a source of gluconeogenesis in the liver.  In adipose tissue, epinephrine increases the breakdown of triglycerides, thereby increasing circulating free fatty acids and glycerol that can be utilized as gluconeogenetic substrates. $#(Choice C)#  During the first 12 hours of fasting, hepatic glycogenolysis is the source for most of the body's glucose.  When hypoglycemia is sustained, gluconeogenesis in the renal cortex becomes an important glucose source.  Epinephrine is more effective than glucagon in stimulating renal gluconeogenesis. $#(Choice E)#  Glucagon and insulin are pancreatic hormones that act as key blood glucose regulators.  Insulin decreases blood glucose levels and suppresses glucagon secretion.  Although it sounds counterintuitive, glucagon stimulates insulin secretion by acting on the pancreatic beta cells (allowing glucose to be taken up by insulin-sensitive tissues). $#(Choice G)#  The treatment of choice in hypoglycemic patients without an altered sensorium is to administer glucose orally as glucose is a monosaccharide that gets absorbed rapidly from the gastrointestinal tract. $#Educational objective# Glucagon increases serum glucose by increasing hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis.  Glucagon also stimulates insulin secretion from the pancreas.  Unlike epinephrine, glucagon has an insignificant effect on glucose homeostasis in the skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and renal cortex.  "

Other possible findings include hyperglycemia, dermal atrophy, and easy bruisability.  Hypercortisolism can be confirmed on finding an elevated late-night salivary cortisol concentration or #increased 24-hour urine cortisol# excretion. $Cushing syndrome can be categorized as ACTH-dependent (ie, #↑ACTH# stimulating excess cortisol production) or ACTH-independent (ie, glucocorticoid excess not caused by ACTH).  Excess ACTH secretion causes identifiable clinical findings: $• #Hyperpigmentation:#  Both ACTH and alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) are derived from pro-opiomelanocortin, leading to cosecretion of alpha-MSH.  ACTH also directly stimulates the MC2R receptor on melanocytes. $• Androgenization:  ACTH stimulates production of adrenal androgens (eg, #↑DHEAS# [dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate], androstenedione).  This leads to #hirsutism#, #menstrual abnormalities#, and oily skin. $This patient's hyperpigmentation and hirsutism are consistent with ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism, likely due to a corticotroph pituitary adenoma (#Cushing disease#). $#(Choice B)#  Primary adrenal insufficiency leads to decreased cortisol levels (and decreased urinary cortisol excretion) with a compensatory rise in ACTH.  Hyperpigmentation may be present, but adrenal androgen production is often diminished (due to loss of androgen-producing adrenocortical cells) and hirsutism is not present. $#(Choices C and E)#  ACTH-independent Cushing syndrome due to a cortisol-producing adrenal adenoma is characterized by increased urinary cortisol excretion with suppressed ACTH levels.  Exogenous glucocorticoids also cause suppression of ACTH, but with decreased production (and urinary excretion) of cortisol.  Low cortisol excretion and ACTH levels are also seen in central adrenal insufficiency.  Because ACTH is low in these states, patients do not have hyperpigmentation or hyperandrogenic features (eg, hirsutism). $#(Choice D)#  Polycystic ovary syndrome is characterized by excessive ovarian production of androgens.  Common clinical features include oligo/amenorrhea, obesity, and hirsutism.  However, ACTH and cortisol production are unaffected, and hyperpigmentation is not seen. $#Educational objective# Cushing syndrome can be categorized as ACTH-dependent or ACTH-independent.

Large tumors can cause #headaches# due to mass effect, and compression of the optic chiasm by suprasellar extension of the tumor can cause #bitemporal hemianopsia#.  These tumors can also cause loss of normal pituitary function by compression of surrounding cells.  Pituitary adenomas typically arise from 1 of the 5 major cell types of the anterior pituitary; physiologic symptoms depend on the hormones produced by the tumor.  The most common hormonally active (functional) adenomas are prolactin-secreting adenomas (#prolactinomas#). $Prolactin is a peptide hormone whose primary action is maintenance of lactation in the postpartum period; prolactinomas classically cause galactorrhea in premenopausal women.  Prolactin also suppresses @GnRH production@ from the hypothalamus, which in women leads to amenorrhea and in men causes #hypogonadism# (eg, impotence, #decreased libido#, infertility).  Because the symptoms of hyperprolactinemia in men and postmenopausal women are often mild and nonspecific, patients may not seek care until the tumors are large and cause mass effect symptoms. $#(Choices B, D, and F)#  Somatotroph (growth hormone-secreting) adenomas can present with gigantism (in children) or @acromegaly@ in adults.  Thyrotroph (TSH-secreting) adenomas cause central hyperthyroidism (eg, heat intolerance, tachycardia).

These tumors are significantly less common than prolactinomas. $#(Choice C)#  Mass lesions involving the pituitary stalk or posterior pituitary could cause headaches and bitemporal hemianopsia in addition to central diabetes insipidus (due to decreased release of antidiuretic hormone [ADH] from the posterior pituitary).  However, polyuria is typically only transient (lasting <6 weeks) because the hypothalamus is able to bypass the pituitary and directly release ADH into the circulation. $#(Choice E)#  Hyperpigmentation in the context of pituitary disease is typically due to hypersecretion of ACTH, either due to a corticotroph adenoma or in response to primary adrenal insufficiency. $#Educational objective# Pituitary tumors can present with headaches, bitemporal hemianopsia, and hypopituitarism; the most common hormonally active (functional) adenomas are prolactin-secreting adenomas (prolactinomas).

  "explanation_2": "#Pheochromocytoma# is a tumor of the #chromaffin cells# of the #adrenal medulla# characterized by excess production of #catecholamines# (norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine).  Fluctuating catecholamine release results in increased vascular tone and hypertension, often associated with episodic headache, diaphoresis, and palpitations.  The diagnosis is confirmed by detecting elevated levels of urinary and plasma catecholamines and metanephrines (catecholamine breakdown products). $Histopathology shows a highly vascular tumor with nests of spindle-shaped or polygonal cells.  The neurohormonal character of the cells is confirmed with stains for #synaptophysin#, #chromogranin#, and #neuron-specific enolase#, and electron microscopy may show dense membrane-bound granules containing catecholamines. $#(Choices A and C)#  Syndromes associated with steroid hormone-producing tumors of the adrenal cortex include hypercortisolism (@Cushing syndrome@), hyperaldosteronism (hypertension, hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis), and hyperandrogenism (hirsutism, acne, androgenetic hair loss).  Metabolically active ovarian tumors also can cause hyperandrogenism.  Overproduction of steroid hormones is apparent on electron microscopy as well-developed smooth endoplasmic reticulum rather than membrane-bound secretory granules. $#(Choice D)#  Parathyroid adenomas (or carcinomas) cause primary hyperparathyroidism resulting in hypercalcemia.  Characteristic symptoms include constipation, abdominal pain, bone pain, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. $#(Choice E)#  Toxic nodular thyroid disease could produce this patient's symptoms (eg, diaphoresis, weight loss).  However, metabolically active thyroid adenomas typically show a follicular structure, with uniform cells and large amounts of follicular colloid. $#Educational objective# Pheochromocytoma is a tumor arising from the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla characterized by excess production of catecholamines.  Clinical features include episodic hypertension, diaphoresis, and palpitations.  Microscopic examination of the tumor cells shows electron-dense, membrane-bound secretory granules, and immunohistochemistry is positive for synaptophysin, chromogranin, and neuron-specific enolase.

Prolactin-secreting adenomas (prolactinomas) are the most common pituitary tumors.  In premenopausal women, prolactinomas typically present with metabolic symptoms (eg, menstrual irregularities, galactorrhea); in men and postmenopausal women they usually present later when tumor enlargement leads to mass effect symptoms such as headache or #bitemporal visual field defects# (causing clumsiness in this patient) due to compression of the optic chiasm. $#Entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors# are the third major tumor type in MEN1.

This patient has visual field defects consistent with a pituitary mass lesion, which warrants cerebral imaging.  In addition, he has a history of symptomatic hyperparathyroidism.  Given these features of MEN1, he is also at increased risk for entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. $#(Choice A)#  Pheochromocytoma is an adrenal medullary tumor that occurs commonly in MEN2A and 2B.  However, this patient's visual field defect suggests a pituitary tumor, which is more characteristic of MEN1 (not associated with pheochromocytoma). $#(Choice B)#  Primary bone tumors are not increased in MEN1, although malignant neuroendocrine tumors may occasionally metastasize to bone. $#(Choice C)#  The major inherited syndromes associated with breast cancer include BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations (breast, ovarian, uterine/fallopian tube, pancreatic cancers).  Less common syndromes include Cowden syndrome,  Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.  Hyperparathyroidism and pituitary tumors are not prominent manifestations of any of these syndromes and are more consistent with MEN1. $#(Choice D)#  Familial adenomatous polyposis is associated with an increased risk of colon cancer and with adrenal adenomas and thyroid cancer. $#Educational objective# Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 syndrome is characterized by tumors of the pituitary, parathyroid gland, and pancreas (the \"3 Ps\").

Characteristic features include unilateral or bilateral breast enlargement that is directly under the nipple-areolar complex, is often #tender#, and measures <4 cm. $The mechanism of physiologic gynecomastia is likely multifactorial: $• #Imbalance of estradiol and testosterone:#  During early male puberty, adrenal androgens increase (ie, adrenarche) and are converted by aromatase to estrogens, which stimulate growth of glandular breast tissue.  Testosterone, which is produced by the testes and inhibits the development of breast tissue, typically remains low until full maturation of the @hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis@.  This may cause a transient estrogen excess, and some patients may be prone to gynecomastia because of a greater local concentration of aromatase. $• Higher insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels:  Boys with physiologic gynecomastia have #higher serum IGF-1#, which stimulates glandular breast tissue, than those without, resulting in a further imbalance of prostimulatory hormones. $Diagnosis is clinical, but all adolescents should also be screened for substance use (eg, marijuana, alcohol, anabolic steroids), as was done in this patient, because it may contribute to gynecomastia.  Management of physiologic gynecomastia includes observation and #reassurance# that it typically #self-resolves# within a year; frequent follow-up may be required for patients with psychosocial stress (eg, low self-esteem). $#(Choices A, C, and D)#  Pathologic gynecomastia should be suspected in patients who develop breast tissue outside of midpuberty or who have rapidly enlarging tissue or tissue >4 cm.  Evaluation may include a serum hormone panel (eg, hCG, LH, estradiol, testosterone) to evaluate for pathologic hormone imbalance.  For example, low testosterone levels suggest hypogonadism and may warrant karyotyping to evaluate for @Klinefelter syndrome@ (47,XXY) and/or serum prolactin to assess for a prolactin-secreting tumor.  This patient's stage 4 pubic hair and otherwise normal examination make physiologic gynecomastia much more likely. $#(Choice B)#  Mammography may be indicated for findings concerning for breast cancer, such as a fixed, nontender mass outside of the nipple-areolar complex with associated skin dimpling, nipple discharge, or adenopathy.  Breast cancer is exceedingly rare in adolescent boys, and this patient has no red-flag findings. $#Educational objective# Physiologic gynecomastia is a benign condition caused by a transient proestrogenic hormonal imbalance during midpuberty; it presents in adolescent boys with unilateral or bilateral tender breast enlargement.

Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is normally produced in the hypothalamus and secreted from the @posterior pituitary@  in response to changes in plasma osmolality and intravascular volume.  However, #small cell lung carcinomas#, which are tumors of neuroendocrine origin, often release ADH independent of feedback inhibition (paraneoplastic effect).  This @inappropriate secretion@ of ADH leads to hyponatremia, decreased plasma osmolality, and elevated urine osmolality (which normally should be <100 mOsm/kg when hyponatremia is present).  The profound hyponatremia that occurs in SIADH can cause headache, weakness, #altered mental status#, and seizures. $In SIADH, increased ADH causes excessive water absorption by the kidneys, leading to a transient, subclinical hypervolemia.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient with new-onset hyponatremia after drug exposure most likely has the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (#SIADH#).  This condition can be caused by a multitude of drugs, including #carbamazepine#, cyclophosphamide, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. $Posterior pituitary hormones (eg, #ADH#, oxytocin) are #synthesized# within magnocellular neurons found in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the #hypothalamus#, with the former primarily producing ADH and the latter oxytocin #(choices D and F)#.  Once translated, these hormones are attached to carrier proteins known as neurophysins.  The complexes are packaged into vesicles and travel down axon projections via anterograde transport into the posterior pituitary (neurohypophysis). $At their terminal endings, the axons become neurosecretory terminals known as Herring bodies, temporarily storing secretory vesicles.  Pituicytes (glial cells) regulate the permeability of the hypophysial capillaries, facilitating #secretion# of ADH and oxytocin from the #posterior pituitary# into the hypophysial vein. $#(Choice A)#  The anterior pituitary (adenohypophysis) is the glandular portion of the pituitary that lies closest to the optic chiasm.  It is composed of various hormone-secreting cells, including lactotrophs (prolactin), corticotrophs (ACTH), somatotrophs (growth hormone), thyrotrophs (TSH), and gonadotrophs (FSH, LH). $#(Choice B)#  The intermediate lobe of the pituitary gland is a vestigial region derived from the posterior wall of the Rathke pouch during embryonic development.  Although predominantly nonfunctioning, the remainder produces melanocyte-stimulating hormone and endorphins. $#(Choice C)#  The median eminence is a small ridge of hypothalamic tissue that secretes regulatory hormones (both releasing and inhibitory) that modulate the anterior pituitary.  These include corticotropin-releasing hormone, gonadotropin releasing hormone, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, and growth hormone–releasing hormone. $#Educational objective# Vasopressin and oxytocin are synthesized and packaged with carrier proteins (neurophysins) within neurons found in the hypothalamus.  The hormones are then transported down axonal projections to the posterior pituitary (neurohypophysis), where they are secreted into circulation.  "

Cranial imaging (typically MRI scan) can confirm the diagnosis of a pituitary adenoma.  Unlike other pituitary hormones, prolactin secretion is under negative regulation by dopamine from the hypothalamus, and any disruption of dopaminergic pathways in the pituitary stalk can cause a moderate increase in prolactin release.  However, #very high prolactin levels#, as seen in this patient, suggest a prolactin-secreting adenoma (#prolactinoma#). $Increased circulating levels of prolactin @suppress GnRH secretion@, leading to a reduction in release of LH from the pituitary and decreased testicular testosterone production.  In premenopausal women, prolactinomas typically present early with galactorrhea and amenorrhea.  However, in men and postmenopausal women, early symptoms may be subtle and nonspecific (eg, decreased libido), and patients frequently present later with mass effect symptoms (eg, headache, visual field defects). $#(Choices B and D)#  Physiologic GnRH secretion occurs in a pulsatile fashion and initiates gonadotropin (eg, LH, FSH) and subsequently testosterone secretion.  However, prolonged, continuous GnRH secretion suppresses gonadotropins, resulting in lower levels of sex steroids.  Long-acting GnRH agonists (eg, leuprolide) are used to suppress sex steroid–dependent diseases (eg, prostate cancer). $#(Choice C)#  Primary hypogonadism with low testosterone levels results in loss of negative feedback on GnRH release, causing elevated levels of GnRH and LH. $#(Choice E)#  Intake of exogenous testosterone (eg, anabolic steroid use) will suppress release of GnRH and subsequently LH. $#Educational objective# Large prolactin-secreting pituitary tumors can compress the optic chiasm, causing bitemporal hemianopsia.

Hypoalbuminemia lowers the plasma oncotic pressure and causes interstitial edema formation due to net plasma filtration.  Minimal change disease (MCD) is the most common cause of nephrosis in children, and can occur in adults as well. $#(Choice A)#  A decrease in capillary hydrostatic pressure would tend to decrease net plasma filtration and interstitial edema formation. $#(Choice B)#  This patient's ankle edema is the result of a transudate of plasma into the interstitial tissues of the ankle.  We would therefore expect an increase in the steady state interstitial fluid pressure in the ankles. $#(Choice D)#  While a primary decrease in lymphatic drainage can cause interstitial edema, the rate of lymphatic drainage would be increased in this particular patient because of the accumulation of ankle interstitial fluid. $#(Choice E)#  In nephrotic syndrome, the plasma oncotic pressure is decreased, which causes net plasma filtration into the interstitium, thus decreasing the effective circulating intravascular volume.  This reduction of the intravascular volume stimulates a compensatory increase in the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.  Patients with nephrotic syndrome tend to have elevated circulating aldosterone levels. $#Educational objective# Frothy or foamy urine may be caused by proteinuria.

This information is transmitted to nearby #JG cells# that are located mainly in the wall of the #afferent arteriole#.

Long-term renal hypoperfusion, such as caused by renal artery stenosis, leads the JG cells of the affected kidney(s) to undergo #hyperplasia# as a result of chronic stimulation. $When renal artery stenosis is restricted to one side and the contralateral kidney functions normally, chronic kidney disease does not occur as the normal kidney is still able to efficiently filter and excrete waste products (eg, creatinine, urea).  However, hypertension can occur in both unilateral and bilateral disease, as secretion of renin by one kidney will lead to systemic vasoconstriction and retention of salt and water by both kidneys. $#(Choices A, C, and E)#  The cuboidal cells of the proximal tubule, the intraglomerular mesangial cells (which are distinct from the extraglomerular mesangial [Lacis] cells), and the squamous cells of the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle are not components of the JG apparatus and do not undergo hyperplasia in response to hypoperfusion.  In fact, these tissues may atrophy in the clipped kidney due to ischemia. $#(Choice B)#  The endothelium is composed of a single layer of squamous cells that line blood vessel walls; endothelial cells do not undergo hyperplasia in response to hypoperfusion.  Efferent arteriolar smooth muscle cells may undergo hypertrophy/hyperplasia with chronic angiotensin stimulation, but these lie within the arteriolar wall (underneath the endothelium). $#Educational objective# Renal artery stenosis causing significant renal hypoperfusion will result in a decreased glomerular filtration rate and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.

  "explanation_2": "This patient's presentation is consistent with #urge incontinence#, which is due to detrusor overactivity causing a sudden and/or frequent urge to urinate and empty the bladder.  The micturition reflex is an autonomic spinal reflex mediated by both sensory and motor fibers from nerve centers at the S2-S4 levels.  Parasympathetic stimulation causes detrusor muscle contraction and internal urethral sphincter relaxation.  Sympathetic fibers cause internal sphincter contraction and also help with sensing a full bladder. $Multiple sclerosis (MS) is likely an autoimmune disease that causes varying degrees of demyelination, inflammation, and gliosis in the central nervous system (eg, optic nerves, spinal cord, brainstem, periventricular white matter, and cerebellum).  Regions in the pons and cerebral cortex partially inhibit the micturition reflex and also regulate contraction/relaxation of the external urethral sphincter.  Spinal cord lesions above the sacral region cause a loss of higher center control of micturition and lead to detrusor hyperreflexia and urge incontinence.  Patients typically develop a frequent urge to urinate and pass a small amount of urine.  As the disease progresses, the bladder can become atonic and dilated leading to overflow incontinence. $#(Choice A)#  Overflow incontinence can be due to impaired detrusor contractility or bladder outlet obstruction (eg, tumor obstructing urethra).  Patients usually develop involuntary and continuous urinary leakage when the bladder is full and often have incomplete emptying.  Post-void residual urine volume is usually high. $#(Choice B)#  Osmotic diuresis due to hyperglycemia can occur in uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and causes polyuria.  However, it more commonly occurs with blood sugar >250 mg/dL.  This patient's blood sugar of 160 mg/dL and absence of glycosuria make this less likely. $#(Choice C)#  Bladder infection (cystitis) can cause irritation of the bladder wall and findings similar to urge incontinence with urinary urgency, frequency, and incontinence.  However, this patient's relatively normal urinalysis (no leukocyte esterase, hematuria, or bacteria seen) makes this less likely.  Up to 5 wbc/hpf is normal.  $#(Choice D)#  Stress incontinence occurs in patients with sphincter dysfunction or weakness when intraabdominal pressure exceeds the urethral sphincter pressure (eg, sneezing, coughing), causing involuntary urine leakage.  This patient's absence of urinary leakage with coughing or sneezing makes this less likely. $#Educational objective# Patients with multiple sclerosis most commonly develop urge incontinence due to loss of central nervous system inhibition of detrusor contraction in the bladder.

The GFR is the volume of fluid filtered from the renal glomerular capillaries into the Bowman capsule per unit of time.  The RPF is the volume of plasma delivered to the kidney per unit of time.  The #filtration fraction# (FF) is the ratio of GFR to RPF (FF = GFR/RPF).  On average, approximately one-fifth of the plasma that passes through the glomerular capillaries is filtered into the Bowman capsule. $This patient is severely hypovolemic due to profuse diarrhea and vomiting.  The decline in circulating blood volume is sensed by arterial and cardiac baroreceptors and triggers increased systemic arteriolar vasoconstriction.  Renal vasoconstriction further lowers the RPF, which is already decreased due to the decline in circulating blood volume.  Decreased RPF causes glomerular perfusion pressure to drop, lowering the GFR and reducing #distal tubule sodium delivery#.  This stimulates secretion of renin and increased #angiotensin II# production.  Angiotensin II preferentially constricts the efferent glomerular arteriole, which increases hydrostatic pressure in the glomerular capillaries to maintain GFR (#autoregulation#).  Due to this compensatory mechanism, the decrease in GFR is less pronounced than the decrease in RPF, resulting in an increased FF #(choices B, C, and E)#.  As RPF continues to decline, increasing glomerular oncotic pressure will eventually overwhelm the compensatory increase in hydrostatic pressure, leading to a precipitous drop in GFR and subsequent renal failure. $#(Choice D)#  Autoregulation improves but often cannot completely normalize the GFR in the setting of decreased renal perfusion pressure.  If the net GFR were increased above normal, it would result in decreased renin formation and loss of the angiotensin II-driven arteriolar constriction required to maintain it. $#Educational objective# Hypovolemia results in a reduced renal plasma flow (RPF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR).  This leads to compensatory efferent arteriolar vasoconstriction, which raises the filtration fraction and maintains GFR at near-normal levels.

It is classically characterized by anemia, bone pain/radiolucent lesions, and #hypercalcemia# due to tumor infiltration of the bone marrow; renal insufficiency can also occur due to hypercalcemia and clogging of the renal tubules with immunoglobulin light chains. $MM tumor cells secrete potent #osteolytic# #cytokines #(eg, tumor necrosis factor-alpha) that liberate calcium from bone and result in hypercalcemia.  Elevated serum calcium inhibits the release of parathyroid hormone (PTH) from parathyroid cells, which has several downstream effects including: $• #Hypercalciuria# – low PTH levels increase urinary calcium excretion due to reduced calcium reabsorption in the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the kidney (where PTH exerts its effects) $• #Low 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D levels# – low PTH (and renal insufficiency) reduce the activity of renal 1-alpha-hydroxylase, the enzyme that converts 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (the more active form) $Therefore, patients with MM classically have low PTH and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels and elevated urinary calcium. $#(Choice A)#  Thiazide diuretics cause hypercalcemia by promoting calcium reabsorption in the @distal convoluted tubule@.  This leads to reduced urinary calcium excretion and low serum PTH levels (elevated serum calcium reduces PTH release).  Angiotensin receptor blockers (eg, valsartan) do not increase renal calcium reabsorption. $#(Choice B)#  Granulomatous diseases (eg, sarcoidosis, tuberculosis) can cause hypercalcemia due to production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D by 1-alpha-hydroxylase in granulomatous tissue.  This increases the intestinal absorption and urinary excretion of calcium (the latter effect being caused by concomitant suppression of PTH). $#(Choice C)#  Production of PTH-related protein (PTHrP) is the most common cause of hypercalcemia in malignancy (eg, squamous cell carcinoma).  PTHrP increases osteoclast activity and renal calcium absorption with minimal effect on 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.  The hypercalcemia seen in MM is not typically due to PTHrP; it is caused by osteolytic cytokines. $#(Choice E)#  Primary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by excessive PTH release, leading to increased bone resorption and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D formation.  Urinary calcium excretion is elevated due to the increased filtered calcium load (despite the increased renal reabsorption induced by PTH). $#(Choice F)#  Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is caused by inactivating mutations of the Ca2+-sensing receptor in the nephron and parathyroid glands.  Renal calcium reabsorption is increased (urinary calcium excretion is low) and higher serum calcium levels are required to suppress PTH release (serum PTH is slightly elevated or inappropriately normal). $#Educational objective# Multiple myeloma is associated with increased bone resorption due to the production of tumor-related cytokines.

However, although hypoalbuminemia lowers the bound fraction (and therefore total serum calcium), ionized calcium remains normal, and patients do not experience hypocalcemic symptoms. $#(Choice D)#  Fibroblast growth factor 23 levels are usually low in patients with normal phosphate metabolism but are increased in patients with renal failure in response to hyperphosphatemia. $#(Choice E)#  Vitamin D toxicity can occur in food faddists, patients with mental illness, and those inadvertently treated with excessive doses of vitamin D.  However, this causes hypercalcemia, not hypocalcemia. $#Educational objective# In chronic kidney disease, reduced excretion of phosphate can cause hyperphosphatemia.  This induces hypocalcemia directly by binding free calcium and depositing in tissues, and indirectly by triggering fibroblast growth factor 23 secretion (decreases calcitriol production and intestinal calcium absorption).  The resulting hypocalcemia can manifest as neuromuscular excitability (eg, carpal spasm).  ",

  "explanation_2": "$This patient cannot reabsorb bicarbonate (HCO3−) in the #proximal convoluted tubule# (PCT), which is characteristic of type 2 renal tubular acidosis (RTA).  #Type 2 RTA# commonly occurs as part of a generalized resorptive dysfunction affecting proximal tubular cells (ie, #Fanconi syndrome#).  Patients presenting in infancy or childhood often have an underlying genetic condition (eg, cystinosis, galactosemia, Dent disease) that predisposes to tubular dysfunction. $The PCT is normally responsible for #reabsorbing HCO3−# as well as #glucose#, #phosphate#, #potassium#, water, and amino acids.  The proximal tubule damage that occurs in Fanconi syndrome leads to loss of these substances in the urine, producing the following clinical effects: $• Inability to resorb HCO3− results in a normal anion gap #metabolic acidosis#.  The resulting decrease in serum HCO3− is compensated by #increased serum chloride# (Cl−) to maintain electronegative balance. $• Excessive tubular glucose impairs renal concentrating ability by acting as an osmotic diuretic, contributing to development of #polyuria #(eg, more wet diapers) and episodes of hypovolemia .  However, plasma glucose is tightly regulated by mechanisms (eg, insulin, glucagon) independent of renal reabsorption.  Therefore, serum #glucose remains normal#. $• #Hypophosphatemia# leads to @rickets@ (eg, widening of wrist joints, frontal bossing, bowing of the legs). $• #Hypokalemia# can cause muscle weakness. $• Loss of amino acids and low-molecular-weight proteins does not typically have a significant effect, but aminoaciduria can be a general marker of proximal tubular dysfunction. $Chronic acidosis, hypophosphatemia, and hypokalemia also contribute to #growth failure#, as seen in this patient. $#Educational objective# The proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) is responsible for reabsorption of bicarbonate as well as glucose, phosphate, potassium, water, and amino acids.  Generalized PCT dysfunction (eg, Fanconi syndrome) results in urinary loss of these substances; in addition, serum chloride rises to maintain electronegative balance from bicarbonate loss and serum glucose remains normal due to intact counterregulatory mechanisms.

Severe hypercalcemia results in impairment of the concentrating capacity of the distal tubule, leading to polyuria and volume depletion.  Mild hypercalcemia is usually due to benign causes (eg, primary hyperparathyroidism), but serum calcium >13 mg/dL suggests an underlying malignancy. $#Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy# (HHM) is the most common cause of hypercalcemia in patients with malignancy and is due to secretion of #parathyroid hormone-related peptide# (PTHrP) by malignant cells.  PTHrP closely resembles PTH at the bioactive amino-terminal region and causes increased bone resorption, decreased renal excretion of calcium, and increased renal excretion of phosphorus (leading to hypophosphatemia #[choice D]#).  However, unlike PTH, PTHrP does not significantly increase 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D production due to structural differences after the first 13 amino acids. $HHM occurs most commonly in squamous cell (ie, lung, head and neck), renal, bladder, breast, and ovarian carcinomas.  This patient's heavy smoking history, weight loss, and lung mass suggest squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.  Hypercalcemia can also occur due to osteolytic bony metastasis (eg, breast cancer, multiple myeloma), but this is less common than HHM and this patient has no lytic lesions visible on imaging. $#(Choice A)#  Hodgkin lymphoma and granulomatous diseases (eg, sarcoidosis) can express 1-alpha-hydroxylase, which increases the formation of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, leading to hypercalcemia.  However, this patient's large lung mass with regional lymph node enlargement is more suggestive of primary squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. $#(Choice B)#  Ectopic ACTH secretion causes paraneoplastic Cushing syndrome, characterized by hypertension, hyperpigmentation, and proximal muscle weakness.  Laboratory studies typically show hyperglycemia rather than hypercalcemia. $#(Choice C)#  Ectopic production of PTH is a very rare cause of hypercalcemia in patients with malignancy.  Patients with HHM have very low levels of PTH due to feedback suppression by hypercalcemia. $#(Choice F)#  Thyrotoxicosis can cause mild hypercalcemia due to increased bone turnover, but severe hypercalcemia is rare, and this patient's high calcium level and lung mass is more suggestive of an underlying malignancy. $#Educational objective# Serum calcium >13 mg/dL is suggestive of an underlying malignancy.

Signs of hypovolemia include dry skin with decreased turgor, dry mucous membranes, decreased urine output, and orthostatic hypotension. $Changes in blood volume or osmolality are detected by sensors in the carotid, hypothalamus, atria, and kidneys and result in activation of multiple compensatory mechanisms: $• Activation of the @renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system@ results in systemic vasoconstriction and increased aldosterone release.  Aldosterone increases #sodium reabsorption# and potassium excretion in the distal tubule and collecting duct. $• The hypothalamus stimulates thirst and increases the secretion of #antidiuretic hormone# (via the posterior pituitary), which promotes @water reabsorption@ in the collecting duct and increases systemic vasoconstriction. $• Sympathetic activity increases renal tubular sodium reabsorption, cardiac output, and systemic vasoconstriction. $The net effect is a rapid increase in blood pressure that helps maintain tissue perfusion, while the kidney begins the slower process of restoring circulatory volume by increasing sodium, urea, and water reabsorption.  #Increased urea reabsorption# is mediated by antidiuretic hormone, which increases urea permeability in the inner medullary collecting ducts. The increase in urea reabsorption accentuates the medullary concentration gradient, promoting maximal free water retention.  These actions typically result in an elevated serum urea level and blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio (typically >20:1).

The resulting #vitamin D deficiency# can present as rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. $Vitamin D increases intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorus; deficiency reduces calcium absorption, which in turn stimulates release of parathyroid hormone (PTH).  Vitamin D also directly inhibits PTH release, and therefore vitamin D deficiency facilitates a significant rise in PTH (secondary hyperparathyroidism).  PTH induces release of calcium and phosphorus from bones, leading to decreased bone mineralization.

However, hypocalcemia may eventually develop as bone stores are depleted in later or more severe cases. $#(Choice A)#  Primary hyperparathyroidism presents with elevated PTH, mild hypercalcemia, and low serum phosphorus (due to increased renal excretion) but is usually due to a parathyroid adenoma and is not associated with celiac disease. $#(Choice C)#  In hypoparathyroidism, low serum PTH is accompanied by hypocalcemia and an increase in serum phosphorus.  Hypoparathyroidism can be caused by severe hypomagnesemia, which can be seen with prolonged diarrhea, but this patient's magnesium level is normal. $#(Choices D and E)#  Chronic kidney disease causes hyperphosphatemia due to decreased filtration and excretion of phosphate.  Concurrently, there is decreased renal production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (the activated form) due to inadequate renal metabolic activity and suppression of 1-alpha-hydroxylase by hyperphosphatemia.  Hypocalcemia may be present, although increased PTH sometimes maintains calcium within laboratory norms.  Pseudohypoparathyroidism is characterized by resistance to PTH and presents with similar biochemical markers. $#Educational objective# Malabsorption caused by celiac disease can lead to vitamin D deficiency.  Patients have decreased serum phosphorus, increased serum parathyroid hormone (secondary hyperparathyroidism), and low (or normal) serum calcium.  "

Factors can include increased gastrointestinal absorption, increased mobilization of calcium from bone, or decreased renal tubular calcium reabsorption.  However, in the absence of an underlying metabolic disorder (eg, hyperparathyroidism), most patients remain #normocalcemic# due to regulation of plasma calcium levels by vitamin D and parathyroid hormone. $#(Choice A)#  Hypercalcemia with resulting hypercalciuria may occur in primary hyperparathyroidism, sarcoidosis, malignancy, and chronic acidemia.  However, these are less common causes of nephrolithiasis, and this patient has no symptoms of hypercalcemia (eg, fatigue, constipation) or clinical features to suggest a disorder that might cause hypercalcemia. $#(Choices B and E)#  Hyperuricosuria with hyperuricemia can occur with myeloproliferative disorders, tumor lysis syndrome, gout, and Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.  High-protein diets typically cause hyperuricosuria with normouricemia.  Hyperuricosuria can cause uric acid stone formation and also predisposes to calcium nephrolithiasis (uric acid precipitation acts as a nidus for calcium deposition). $#(Choice D)#  Hyperoxaluria can result from a diet high in oxalate (found in foods such as chocolate, nuts, and spinach).  Low-calcium diets and intestinal malabsorption syndromes such as Crohn disease can also cause hyperoxaluria as both cause less calcium to be available to bind and trap oxalate in the gut.  Hyperoxaluria is a less common risk factor for calcium stone formation than hypercalciuria. $#Educational objective# Hypercalciuria is the most common risk factor for calcium (calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate) kidney stones in adults; contributing factors may include increased gastrointestinal absorption, increased mobilization of calcium from bone, or decreased renal tubular calcium reabsorption.

Preeclampsia likely occurs due to abnormal placental development that results in high-resistance, low-perfusion vessels and subsequent placental ischemia.  Placental ischemia triggers #widespread endothelial dysfunction#, which causes dysregulated vascular tone (eg, #vasospasm#, vasoconstriction), increased vascular permeability, and decreased end-organ perfusion. $Therefore, a classic presentation of preeclampsia is hypertension with #headache# and #visual changes#: $• Headaches are typically severe and throbbing in nature.  They occur due to dysregulated cerebral blood flow, brain ischemia, and/or capillary leakage resulting in cerebral edema. $• Visual changes include blurry vision, photopsia (seeing \"sparks\"), and #scotomata# (partial vision loss [blind spots]), which are due to #retinal artery vasospasm# and optic nerve ischemia.  Eye movement and the pupillary light reflex typically remain intact. $Symptoms usually resolve after delivery, which is curative for preeclampsia.  However, in rare cases, patients with severe retinal ischemia or retinal detachment may have permanent vision loss. $#(Choice A)#  Choroidal neovascularization, abnormal vessel growth beneath the retina, causes age-related wet macular degeneration.  However, it presents with painless vision loss (no associated headache) and onset of symptoms is typically unilateral (ie, one eye affected first). $#(Choice B)#  A decreased anterior chamber angle (ie, angle-closure glaucoma) can cause headache and visual changes due to increased intraocular pressure.  However, patients typically have a painful red eye and a dilated pupil that reacts poorly to light. $#(Choice C)#  Vitreous hemorrhage is associated with eye injury, anticoagulation, and diabetic retinopathy.  It typically causes monocular vision loss associated with floaters/photopsia, not bilateral scotomata. $#(Choice D)#  Inflammatory optic nerve demyelination (ie, optic neuritis) causes monocular vision loss and eye pain with extraocular movement.  This patient has bilateral visual changes and normal extraocular movement. $#Educational objective# Preeclampsia causes widespread endothelial dysfunction, resulting in dysregulated vascular tone, increased vascular permeability, and decreased end-organ perfusion.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient with leakage of urine with coughing has #stress urinary incontinence# (SUI), a common condition during #pregnancy#.  Risk factors include increasing parity, age, BMI, and maternal weight gain, as in this patient. $Several physiologic changes in pregnancy contribute to SUI.  The gravid uterus applies pressure on the bladder and stretches the connective tissue and muscles that normally support the pelvic organs.  In addition, increased progesterone levels relax the muscles responsible for maintaining urinary continence: the external urethral sphincter and pelvic floor muscles (levator ani muscle complex).  Normally, the external urethral sphincter compresses the urethra and creates a high urethral closing pressure.  The pelvic floor muscles usually stabilize the urethra against the anterior vaginal wall and contract to decrease the @urethrovesical angle@, thereby kinking the urethra closed. $Because of #decreased urethral sphincter tone# and #pelvic floor muscle laxity#, the compression and position/angle of the urethra are compromised such that sudden #increases in intraabdominal pressure# (eg, #coughing#, sneezing) can cause the pressure within the bladder to exceed the urethral closing pressure.  This leads to intermittent leakage of urine. $#(Choices A and C)#  Bladder outlet obstruction (eg, urethral compression by uterine fibroids) and impaired detrusor contractility (eg, spinal cord injury) both lead to urinary retention.  In patients with urinary retention, urine slowly accumulates in the bladder until the intravesical pressure exceeds the urethral closing pressure, causing urine leakage.  Because urine constantly accumulates in the bladder, patients have persistent involuntary dribbling of urine (overflow incontinence) rather than intermittent leakage with cough. $#(Choice B)#  Detrusor muscle hyperactivity is the mechanism behind urgency incontinence (overactive bladder syndrome).  Patients typically have an intense urge to urinate followed by an immediate, involuntary loss of urine. $#(Choice E)#  During pregnancy, the sciatic nerve can become compressed due to increased joint laxity from circulating relaxin and changes in maternal posture (eg, spinal lordosis).  Sciatica commonly presents as lower back pain radiating down one side of the hip to the leg.  It does not cause urinary incontinence. $#(Choice F)#  During pregnancy, the gravid uterus compresses the ureters, leading to physiologic hydronephrosis and ureteral dilation.  These changes increase the risk for urinary stasis and urinary tract infection but do not cause incontinence. $#Educational objective# Stress urinary incontinence, the leakage of urine with increased intraabdominal pressure (eg, coughing), is common in pregnancy due to decreased external urethral sphincter tone and increased pelvic floor muscle laxity.

When either mechanism fails, patients may have PPH and life-threatening blood loss.  Therefore, medications used to treat PPH commonly increase either uterine contractions or clot formation. $After placental delivery, prothrombotic substances in the decidua (eg, tissue factor) activate the extrinsic coagulation cascade, generating thrombin that converts fibrinogen into fibrin, forming a fibrin clot.  At the same time, the @fibrinolytic pathway@ is also activated: tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) is released by damaged endothelium and cleaves plasminogen to form plasmin, which promotes bleeding by breaking down fibrin clots into fibrin degradation products. $#Tranexamic acid# (TXA) stabilizes thrombi/clots by #inhibiting plasmin formation#; therefore, TXA is an #antifibrinolytic medication# that provides more time for the uterine myometrium to contract and constrict the placental bed blood vessels.

In a normal @menstrual cycle@, ovulation (ie, oocyte release) creates the #ovarian corpus luteum#, which increases #progesterone production# to induce endometrial decidualization (ie, uterine lining thickening, formation of the decidua basalis) in preparation for both promotion and maintenance of embryonic implantation #(choice E).# $When the oocyte is fertilized, a blastocyst eventually develops and implants into the uterine decidua basalis approximately 6-7 days after fertilization.  The outer cells of the blastocyst (ie, trophoblast) then differentiate into the @cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast@, which develop into the placenta. $The #syncytiotrophoblast# invades the decidua basalis and #secretes β-hCG# into maternal circulation.  β-hCG signals the ovary to #maintain the corpus luteum# and to continue progesterone production, which maintains both the decidualized endometrium and the pregnancy until the placenta has developed enough to completely take over progesterone production (typically by 10 weeks gestation).  Following this #luteal-placental transition#, the corpus luteum degenerates, and the role of progesterone changes to maintain uterine quiescence (ie, inhibit contractions) #(choice B).# $#(Choice A)#  Estrogen, not hCG, stimulates the anterior pituitary to produce prolactin during pregnancy. $#(Choice C)#  The process of @embryonic cell division@ and differentiation begins before the formation of the placental syncytiotrophoblast, which secretes hCG; therefore, hCG does not cause embryonic cell division. $#Educational objective# β-hCG is a hormone secreted by the placental syncytiotrophoblast after uterine invasion that signals the ovary to maintain the corpus luteum, which produces progesterone in early pregnancy.

Microscopy would reveal @large, edematous villi@ with decreased blood vessels, proliferation of the villous trophoblastic lining, and no fetal tissue.  Ultrasound confirms lack of the fetal pole and amniotic sac, along with diffuse echogenic material in the uterus (eg, @snowstorm pattern@).  Immunohistochemical stain #p57 is negative# in complete moles because of the absence of a maternal genome (the corresponding gene is paternally imprinted). $Classic clinical findings of a complete mole include first-trimester #vaginal bleeding# and an enlarged uterine size out of proportion to gestational age.  #Hyperemesis gravidarum# can occur from increased β-hCG secretion by the proliferating trophoblast.  Excessive amounts of β-hCG also stimulate ovarian growth and can cause the formation of #theca lutein cysts#.  Preeclampsia, anemia, and hyperthyroidism can also be present with complete moles. $#β-hCG# levels must be monitored after uterine evacuation due to a significant risk of #malignant transformation#; rising or persistently elevated levels are a red flag for neoplastic conversion (eg, invasive mole, choriocarcinoma). $#(Choice A)#  An elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level in a pregnant woman may suggest a fetal neural tube defect.

This patient's ovarian cysts are likely theca lutein cysts. $#(Choice E)#  Vaginal cytology can be used to diagnose sarcoma botryoides (ie, embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma), which can occur in young girls (usually age <5 years).  It has a jelly-like cystic appearance (ie, bunch of grapes) and arises from the bladder or vaginal mucosa.

However, this diagnosis is less likely in this patient who also has a missed menstrual cycle and vaginal bleeding. $#(Choice B)#  @Ovarian torsion@ can cause unilateral abdominal pain and adnexal tenderness; patients with prolonged torsion may develop rebound and guarding due to ovarian necrosis.  However, the pain is typically sudden onset (ie, acute occlusion of ovarian blood flow) and vaginal bleeding is uncommon.  An adnexal mass (not present in this patient) may be palpable. $#(Choices C and E)#  Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) typically presents with abdominal pain and cervical motion tenderness due to infection and inflammation of the upper genital tract.  Tuboovarian abscess (TOA) is a severe form of PID that has localized to the adnexa.  Unlike this patient, those with PID or TOA are typically febrile with malodorous cervical discharge. $#Educational objective# Ectopic pregnancy may present with unilateral lower abdominal pain, adnexal tenderness, and vaginal bleeding.  Patients with a ruptured ectopic pregnancy have severe intraabdominal bleeding, which causes diffuse abdominal pain with rebound/guarding and hemodynamic instability.  ",

  "explanation_2": "$This genotypically female (46,XX) infant with ambiguous genitalia was born to a mother who developed masculinizing features during pregnancy, findings which are consistent with aromatase deficiency.  #Aromatase#, a key enzyme in #estrogen synthesis#, normally converts androstenedione to estrone and testosterone to estradiol in various body tissues, including the gonads, adrenal glands, and adipose tissue.  However, the majority of fetal estrogen is synthesized by aromatase #within the fetal placenta#. $#Aromatase deficiency# is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by #high androgen# (and corresponding low estrogen) levels in the fetus and placenta.  Lack of aromatase allows fetal androgens to cross the placenta and enter the maternal circulation, resulting in #maternal gestational virilization# (eg, acne, hirsutism, deep voice). $Newborn #females# with aromatase deficiency have normal internal genitalia but #ambiguous external genitalia# (eg, clitoromegaly).  At puberty, estrogen synthesis is impaired due to absent ovarian aromatase, which results in primary amenorrhea, osteoporosis, and tall stature due to delayed fusion of the epiphyses.  Males with aromatase deficiency have phenotypically normal genitalia but develop tall stature and osteoporosis as adults. $#(Choice A)#  5-Alpha reductase deficiency results in decreased synthesis of dihydrotestosterone, which is responsible for the development of external male genitalia (eg, scrotum, penis).  Affected males have underdeveloped genitalia, whereas females are unaffected at birth. $#(Choice B)#  @17-Alpha hydroxylase deficiency@ is a form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia.  Symptoms result from decreased production of glucocorticoids and androgens (ambiguous genitalia in males) and increased production of mineralocorticoids (hypertension, hypokalemia).  Females have phenotypically normal genitalia. $#(Choice C)#  @21-Hydroxylase deficiency@ is the most common type of congenital adrenal hyperplasia and is associated with salt wasting and adrenal crises due to decreased aldosterone and cortisol synthesis.  Increased androgen production causes ambiguous genitalia in females.  Unlike this case, however, maternal virilization does not occur due to intact placental aromatase activity, which prevents androgens from entering the maternal circulation. $#(Choice E)#  HMG-CoA reductase is the rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol synthesis pathway; statins inhibit this enzyme and reduce endogenous cholesterol synthesis.  It is not involved in sexual differentiation. $#Educational objective# Aromatase is responsible for converting androgens into estrogens.  Deficiency of this enzyme causes accumulation of androgens during pregnancy, resulting in ambiguous external genitalia in newborn females and maternal gestational virilization.  ",

  "explanation_2": "This patient in the third trimester with #painful vaginal bleeding# likely has #abruptio placentae#, the premature separation of the placenta from the myometrium prior to fetal delivery.  @Placental abruption@ occurs when #maternal vessels rupture# at the uteroplacental interface (ie, decidua basalis); the resultant bleeding causes #placental separation# from the uterine myometrium.  Blood can also accumulate between the placenta and uterine wall and cause an acute increase in intrauterine pressure, resulting in severe abdominal pain, uterine irritability (ie, high-frequency contractions), and a #tender, firm uterus#. $In this patient, abruptio placentae is likely a complication of #preeclampsia#, a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy that causes widespread #endothelial cell damage#.  Endothelial cell dysfunction results in dysregulated vascular tone (eg, hypertension) and #increased vessel fragility#.  Preeclampsia also impairs early spiral artery development needed to supply blood to the fetus and placenta.  As a result, patients with preeclampsia have abnormally high-resistance spiral arteries that produce low placental perfusion, ischemia, and possible placental infarction, all of which increase the risk of abruptio placentae. $#(Choice A)#  The abnormal invasion of trophoblast into uterine myometrium (eg, @placenta accreta@) can cause heavy vaginal bleeding.  However, this disorder is typically diagnosed after fetal delivery when the placenta does not detach from the uterine wall, resulting in postpartum (not antepartum) hemorrhage. $#(Choice B)#  @Placenta previa@, the extension of placental tissue over the cervix, can cause antepartum bleeding.  However, placental bleeding from this location can readily exit the uterus via the cervix, so patients typically do not have severe abdominal pain or a firm, tender uterus. $#(Choice C)#  Physiologic cervical dilation (ie, spontaneous labor) can progress from light vaginal bleeding with mild abdominal pain to heavier bleeding during contractions.  Labor pain, however, is typically intermittent, and the uterus relaxes between contractions. $#(Choice E)#  @Rupture@ of the uterine myometrium and serosa can cause abdominal pain and heavy vaginal bleeding.  However, in the classic presentation, fetal parts are palpable through the maternal abdominal wall and patients do not have a firm uterus.  In addition, this patient has no risk factors (eg, prior cesarean delivery), making this diagnosis less likely. $#Educational objective# Abruptio placentae is caused by rupture of maternal vessels at the uteroplacental interface that leads to premature separation of the placenta from the myometrium.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient's limb shortening with normal torso length, specific craniofacial features (frontal bossing, midface hypoplasia), and risk of passing the condition to her offspring (50%) are characteristic of #achondroplasia#.  The condition is caused by an autosomal dominant point mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene; 90% are de novo (unaffected parents) and 10% are inherited.  Because the mutation is #autosomal dominant#, the fetus of an affected and an unaffected parent has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation. $Achondroplasia affects #endochondral ossification#, the process that makes #long bones# (eg, humerus, femur, phalanges) and portions of the skull and face.  In endochondral bone formation, mesenchymal cells differentiate into chondrocytes that secrete cartilage matrix.  These chondrocytes continue to proliferate through childhood, forming an elongating cartilage template that progressively becomes calcified and later invaded by osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and blood vessels originating from the periosteum.  Deposition of osteoid matrix over the septa of calcified cartilage matrix forms woven bone, which then undergoes remodeling into compact bone. $#FGFR3# is normally responsible for limiting chondrocyte proliferation during endochondral ossification.  In achondroplasia, FGFR3 becomes constitutively activated, causing exaggerated #inhibition of chondrocyte proliferation# that results in the characteristic bone shortening and craniofacial abnormalities. $#(Choices B and E)#  Hypothalamic neurosecretory cells produce growth hormone-releasing hormone and anterior pituitary somatotrophs produce growth hormone (GH).  Hypothalamic or pituitary insults (eg, tumor, ischemia) can result in defective release of either hormone.  GH deficiency can lead to proportional short stature (both long and flat bones affected) as opposed to the disproportionate short stature seen in achondroplasia (only long bones affected). $#(Choice C)#  The flat bones (eg, most of the skull, pelvis) grow primarily via intramembranous (not endochondral) ossification.  In intramembranous ossification, mesenchymal cells differentiate directly into osteoblasts and begin osteoid matrix secretion without the formation of cartilaginous bones.  As a result, most flat bones remain unaffected in achondroplasia. $#(Choice D)#  Osteoclasts are specialized macrophages that function to resorb bone.  @Paget disease@, characterized by disordered bone mass, initially begins with excessive activity of abnormally large osteoclasts followed by osteoblastic activity and eventual sclerosis.  Patients are usually elderly and can present with focal bone pain and pathologic fractures. $#Educational objective# Unlike the process of intramembranous ossification that forms flat bones, endochondral ossification proceeds along a cartilage template and is responsible for the formation of long bones.  Achondroplasia is characterized by an exaggerated inhibition of chondrocyte proliferation in the growth plates of long bones and manifests with proximal limb shortening, midface hypoplasia, and macrocephaly.

Cardiovascular: The most common cardiovascular complication of AS is ascending aortitis, which can lead to dilation of the aortic ring and aortic insufficiency  $3. Eye: @Anterior uveitis@ develops in some patients with AS and presents with pain, blurred vision, photophobia, and conjunctival erythema $#(Choice B)#  Hand joint mobility testing is part of the assessment of rheumatoid arthritis severity.  However, the small joints of the hands are not prominently affected in patients with AS. $#(Choice C)#  Peak expiratory flow is determined primarily by airway resistance (obstruction) and expiratory muscle function.  Chest wall restriction has less of an effect on peak expiratory flow, which is normal or only slightly reduced in most patients with AS.  In contrast, regular measurement of expiratory flow rates is important in patients with asthma. $#(Choice D)#  Rheumatoid factor can be found in a variety of rheumatic (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE]) and nonrheumatic disorders (eg, hepatitis C) and in up to 4% of young and healthy individuals.  However, it is not associated with AS. $#(Choice E)#  Urine protein excretion should be monitored in SLE and diabetes mellitus.  Renal involvement is rare in AS. $#Educational objective# Ankylosing spondylitis is characterized by stiffness and fusion of axial joints (ankylosis) and inflammation at the site of insertion of tendons into bone (enthesitis).

The main cells involved are endothelial cells, T lymphocytes, and fibroblasts: $• #Vascular endothelial cells# produce excessive #endothelin 1#, which causes vasoconstriction and activation of underlying fibroblasts.  They also increase expression of #adhesion molecules#, which facilitates binding and extravasation of circulating lymphocytes. $• #T lymphocytes# migrate into the tissues and increase expression of numerous cytokines that further activate tissue fibroblasts. $• #Dermal fibroblasts# produce increasing quantities of #collagen# and ground substance, leading to thickening and stiffening of the tissue. $The skin in SS undergoes dermal expansion due to diffuse deposition of collagen (eosinophilic connective tissue), resulting in atrophy of the intradermal adipose tissue and obliteration of dermal appendages (eg, hair follicles, glands).  Early symptoms often include finger swelling and mild pruritus.  With progression of the disease, patients may experience dermal sclerosis (@sclerodactyly@), dermal ulcers, nail atrophy, and digital calcinosis. $#(Choice A)#  @Psoriasis@ is characterized by activation of antigen-presenting dendritic cells, leading to recruitment and differentiation of T-helper cells, which in turn produce additional inflammatory cytokines that stimulate keratinocyte proliferation and generate a neutrophilic response (eg, focal microabscesses).  However, psoriasis presents with well-demarcated, scaly, erythematous plaques rather than skin thickening and ulceration. $#(Choice C)#  The immune response in Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection is characterized by stimulation of CD4 T lymphocytes; these cells subsequently activate macrophages, which can differentiate into epithelioid histiocytes and coalesce into multinucleated Langhans @giant cells@.  Cutaneous tuberculosis may present with a variety of skin lesions (eg, papules, plaques, pustules), but thickening and ulceration of digital skin are more consistent with SS. $#(Choice D)#  Migration of T lymphocytes, eosinophils, and basophils is seen in the late acute phase of asthma as well as in allergic and chronic urticaria.  Urticaria manifests as acute erythematous wheals, not chronic sclerodactyly and ulceration. $#Educational objective# The pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) involves vascular endothelial cells (increased expression of endothelin 1 and adhesion molecules), T lymphocytes (production of cytokines that activate fibroblasts), and dermal fibroblasts (increased production of collagen and ground substance).

  "explanation_2": "$This patient's clinical findings of intermittent diplopia, difficulty chewing, and speech problems (especially at the end of the day) suggest a diagnosis of #myasthenia gravis# (MG).  MG is caused by impaired functioning of nicotinic cholinergic receptors at the neuromuscular junction due to interference by #IgG autoantibodies#.  First-line treatment is an anticholinesterase agent (eg, pyridostigmine), which increases the amount of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction.  Acetylcholinesterase activity decreases at lower temperatures, so application of an #ice pack# can also improve symptoms caused by weakness of superficial muscles (eg, ptosis). $MG is a form of @type II hypersensitivity@, which is characterized by IgM and/or IgG #autoantibodies# that bind to cell surface antigens and/or extracellular matrix components.  Among the available options, only #Goodpasture syndrome# is due to the production of autoantibodies (directed against type IV collagen in the alveolar/glomerular basement membrane); these antibodies cause inflammatory destruction of the lung alveoli and renal glomeruli. $#(Choice A)#  Atopic dermatitis is a chronic, pruritic, eczematous skin condition that almost always begins in childhood.  The pathogenicity involves several factors, including skin barrier abnormalities, defects in innate immunity, and a TH2-skewed immune response. $#(Choice B)#  The pathogenesis of contact dermatitis (@type IV hypersensitivity reaction@) involves cutaneous exposure to small foreign molecules (haptens) that bind to skin proteins.  These proteins are subsequently processed by antigen-presenting Langerhans cells that promote the development of hapten-specific T cells.  With continued hapten exposure, sensitized T cells produce inflammatory cytokines at the exposure site, causing the characteristic eczematous skin changes. $#(Choice D)#  Most patients with acute hypersensitivity pneumonitis have specific serum IgG antibodies that precipitate bacterial or fungal antigens found in inhaled organic dust particles.  This causes interstitial alveolitis and bronchiolitis via immune-complex and complement deposition in vessel walls (@type III hypersensitivity mechanism@). $#(Choice E)#  The pathogenesis of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis involves granular deposition of immune complexes containing group A Streptococcus antigens, IgG, and C3 in the glomerular basement membrane and mesangium.  It is a type III, immune complex–mediated, hypersensitivity response. $#Educational objective# Myasthenia gravis results from an autoimmune type II (antibody-mediated) hypersensitivity reaction against skeletal myocyte surface acetylcholine receptors.  Goodpasture syndrome similarly involves autoantibodies against basement membrane collagen in the renal glomeruli and lung alveoli.  ",

The disease is thought to be caused by environmental factors and gene mutations (eg, affecting RANK, osteoprotegerin) that result in excessive RANK and NF-κB activation.  This leads to increased @osteoclast differentiation@ and activity.  The disease typically progresses through 3 phases:  $1. #Osteolytic (osteoclast-dominant) phase# – characterized by increased numbers of osteoclasts that appear abnormally large with an excessive number of nuclei.  Increased resorption activity is prominent.  $2. Mixed (osteoclastic-osteoblastic) phase – defined by a rapid increase in osteoblastic bone formation with persistent osteoclastic activity.  The newly made bone is abnormal, with interspersed areas of disorganized lamellar and woven bone.  $3. #Osteosclerotic (osteoblast-dominant) phase# – characterized by continued osteoblastic bone formation and remodelling that result in a dense, hypovascular, #mosaic pattern# of lamellar bone with irregular, haphazardly oriented sections separated by #prominent cement lines#. $The end result is a thickened, deformed bone that is weaker than normal and prone to fracture. $#(Choice A)#  Chondrocytes are not involved in the pathogenesis of PDB. $#(Choices B and C)#  In the early stages of PDB, the adjacent marrow spaces are replaced by highly vascular stromal tissue as a result of increased endothelial cell and fibroblast proliferation due to cytokines secreted by osteoclasts.  The increased vascularity causes arteriovenous shunting that can result in high-output heart failure. $#(Choice D)#  Although this patient's bone biopsy shows findings characteristic of the osteosclerotic (osteoblast-dominant) phase of Paget disease, the question is specifically asking about the #initial (osteolytic) phase# of Paget disease, where osteoclast activity is predominantly increased.  Increased activity and dysregulation of osteoblasts and fibroblasts increase the risk of developing sarcomas (eg, osteosarcoma) in patients with PDB. $#Educational objective# Bone pain and elevated alkaline phosphatase level in an elderly patient can occur with osteoblast metastases and Paget disease of bone (PDB).  Biopsy showing a mosaic pattern of lamellar bone is diagnostic for PDB.  The initial phase in PDB is characterized by an increase in osteoclastic activity.  ",

RA is a progressive autoimmune disorder that has a peak incidence at age 50-75 but can occur at any age; women are affected more often than men.  Systemic symptoms (eg, fatigue, fever) are common. $The pathogenesis of RA involves both humoral (eg, autoantibodies against citrullinated polypeptides) and cell-mediated immunity; activation of #CD4+ T cells#, especially Th1 and Th17, occurs early in the disease process.  Macrophages release proinflammatory cytokines critical for the development and #progressive articular destruction# seen in RA.  These include: $• #Tumor necrosis factor-alpha# (TNF-alpha) stimulates the proliferation of inflammatory cells and causes expression of inflammatory factors (eg, collagenase, prostaglandins) by synovial cells. $• #IL-1# induces synthesis of matrix metalloproteinases and enhances T-cell immune responses. $The proteases (eg, collagenase, metalloproteinase) contribute to cartilage destruction.  In addition, both cytokines indirectly activate osteoclasts, resulting in bony erosions.  Monoclonal antibodies that inhibit TNF-alpha (eg, adalimumab, etanercept) or IL-1 receptors (eg, anakinra) are widely used in the treatment of RA and can slow progression of the disease. $#(Choice B)#  Activated Th1 cells produce significant quantities of IL-2 and interferon gamma, among other cytokines.

While at a picnic outdoors, this patient was likely exposed to an #allergen# (eg, insect sting) that caused @cross-linking@ of basophil-bound and #mast cell–bound IgE antibodies#, inducing cellular activation, #degranulation#, and #release of histamine# and other chemical mediators (eg, prostaglandin, leukotrienes). $Although multiple chemical mediators play a role in anaphylaxis, histamine is believed to cause the most significant, broad-ranging effects, including the following: $• H1 and H2 receptor stimulation results in #vasodilation# (causing #hypotension#) and increased catecholamine secretion (causing #tachycardia#). $• H1 receptor stimulation causes increased bronchial smooth muscle contraction (resulting in #bronchoconstriction# and wheezing) and #increased vascular permeability# (worsening hypotension and contributing to urticaria). $• H2 receptor stimulation increases gastric acid secretion, which contributes to gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, nausea, vomiting). $In addition, histamine can activate peripheral nociceptive receptors, causing pruritus or pain.  To mitigate its widespread effects, an antihistamine is often given as adjunct treatment in anaphylaxis after mainstay treatment with intramuscular epinephrine. $#(Choice A)#  Gram-negative bacterial endotoxins are the most potent mediators of gram-negative sepsis.  Although sepsis can present with hypotension, tachycardia, and respiratory symptoms, children with sepsis typically have fever, and the onset of symptoms occurs over hours to days (vs minutes).  In addition, wheals are not expected. $#(Choice B)#  Gram-positive bacterial enterotoxin is the cause of staphylococcal food poisoning, which can cause vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps.  However, symptoms typically occur 2-8 hours after ingestion (vs immediately) of contaminated food, and wheezing and wheals are not expected. $#(Choice C)#  Kallikrein-generated bradykinin plays a role in bradykinin-mediated angioedema (eg, hereditary, ACE inhibitor–related), which can cause bowel wall edema and result in nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.  In contrast to mast cell–mediated angioedema, bradykinin-mediated angioedema does not typically cause bronchospasm, urticaria, or hypotension. $#(Choice E)#  Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide is secreted by VIPomas, rare functioning neuroendocrine tumors most often located in the pancreas.  VIPomas can cause watery diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting; however, acute-onset hypotension, wheezing, and wheals are not expected. $#Educational objective# Anaphylaxis is an IgE-mediated response to an allergen that results in the release of histamine by mast cells and basophils.  Histamine causes widespread physiologic effects, including vasodilation and increased vascular permeability (eg, hypotension), increased catecholamine secretion (eg, tachycardia), and bronchoconstriction (eg, wheezing).

Arteriolar vasodilation causes decreased systemic vascular resistance and consequent hypotension; venular vasodilation causes decreased central venous pressure and reduces venous return to the right atrium.  In addition, the inflammatory chemical mediators #increase vascular permeability#, leading to large fluid shifts from the intravascular to the extravascular space; this #decreases intravascular volume# and worsens #hypotension#. $#(Choice A)#  Chemical mediators (eg, histamine) released from cardiac mast cells may exert negative ionotropic effects on the heart, decreasing cardiac contractility.  However, this is typically counterbalanced by the body's sympathetic response to anaphylaxis; increased sympathetic activity has a positive inotropic effect and increases the heart rate in an attempt to compensate for widespread peripheral vasodilation. $#(Choice C)#  Increased, not impaired, endogenous sympathetic nerve activity is the body's early compensatory response in anaphylaxis.  In response to anaphylaxis-induced hypotension, an intact @baroreceptor reflex@ leads to increased sympathetic activity, tachycardia, and compensatory vasoconstriction. $#(Choices D and E)#  A toxin-mediated decrease in myocardial contractility and an increase in capillary permeability occur in toxic shock syndrome (TSS).  Most cases are linked to a prolonged use of tampons and wound/nasal packing (not wasp envenomation), which provide a medium for Staphylococcus aureus to replicate and release an exotoxin (eg, TSS toxin 1) that is capable of nonspecifically activating T cells (ie, a @superantigen@).  The subsequent dramatic release of inflammatory cytokines results in increased capillary permeability and hypotension, as well as high fever and a diffuse, erythematous rash.  In addition, the exotoxin can directly inhibit myocardial function. $#Educational objective# n anaphylaxis, allergen exposure triggers widespread IgE-mediated release of inflammatory chemical mediators (eg, histamine, prostaglandin, leukotrienes).

Other common features include mucocutaneous candidiasis, persistent diarrhea, and failure to thrive.  Laboratory studies show very low or #absent CD3+ T cells# and #hypogammaglobulinemia#.  Thymic hypoplasia or aplasia is another common finding in infants with SCID due to severe T cell deficiency. $#(Choice A)#  Common variable immunodeficiency is a heterogenous condition caused by B and T cell dysfunction and characterized by hypogammaglobulinemia.  It presents with recurrent infections in adults and children (after the neonatal period).  While not entirely unaffected, cell-mediated immunity is not as impaired as in SCID and thymic aplasia is unlikely. $#(Choice B)#  DiGeorge syndrome (DGS) classically presents with craniofacial abnormalities, conotruncal cardiac anomalies, hypoplastic thymus, and hypocalcemia resulting from parathyroid hypoplasia.  Immunodeficiency can also occur and is related to the degree of thymic hypoplasia.  Although complete DGS (<1% of cases) is a form of SCID, the absence of other characteristic findings makes DGS a less likely diagnosis. $#(Choice D)#  In Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, functioning of both T and B cells is impaired due to abnormal cytoskeletal functioning.  Patients experience recurrent viral, bacterial, and fungal infections that generally worsen with age.  However, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome also typically causes bleeding due to thrombocytopenia and eczema. $#(Choice E)#  X-linked (Bruton's) agammaglobulinemia is an immunodeficiency syndrome caused by insufficient production of mature B cells, which predisposes mainly to recurrent infections with encapsulated pyogenic bacteria (eg, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae type B).  The quantity and functioning of T cells is generally not affected, so an absent thymic shadow is unlikely. $#Educational objective# Severe combined immune deficiency is characterized by combined T and B cell dysfunction.

Xanthine oxidase deficiency leads to abnormally low levels of uric acid in the serum; it can also lead to renal calculi due to the relative insolubility of xanthine at urine's pH level. $#Educational objective# The second most common cause of severe combined immunodeficiency is autosomal recessive deficiency of adenosine deaminase, an enzyme necessary for the elimination of excess adenosine within cells.

Type I reactions cause vasodilation and tissue edema and inflammatory infiltration; they do not cause vasculitis with fibrinoid necrosis. $#(Choice D)#  Deposition of IgA-containing immune complexes is involved in the pathogenesis of Henoch-Schönlein purpura in pediatric patients.  IgA does not play an important role in type III hypersensitivity. $#(Choice E)#  Serum sickness causes release of the C5a complement fragment (a neutrophil chemoattractant) at sites of immune complex deposition.  This leads to neutropenia (not neutrophilia) due to extensive neutrophilic marginalization and tissue infiltration.  In addition, infliximab and other TNF-alpha inhibitors can also cause neutropenia. $#(Choice F)#  Mild thrombocytopenia has been associated with serum sickness due to platelet consumption at the site of active vascular inflammation.  However, severe thrombocytopenia is unlikely to occur. $#Educational objective# Serum sickness is a type III hypersensitivity reaction to nonhuman proteins characterized by vasculitis resulting from tissue deposition of circulating immune complexes.  Clinical findings include fever, pruritic skin rash, arthralgias, and low serum C3 and C4 complement levels.  "

  "explanation_2": "$This patient with craniofacial abnormalities, recurrent sinopulmonary infections, and congenital heart disease most likely has a #22q11 deletion syndrome# (22qDS).  The various 22qDS phenotypes, including @DiGeorge syndrome@, are caused by loss of genes responsible for embryonic transformation of the pharyngeal apparatus (eg, head and neck structures) and the secondary heart field (eg, cardiac outflow tract).  The @third pouch@ is commonly affected, typically manifesting as #thymic hypoplasia# (eg, attenuation of the @thymic shadow@ on chest x-ray). $The thymus is the site of #T-cell maturation#, and its maldevelopment precludes the normal migration of mature T cells to secondary lymphoid organs.  In lymph nodes, mature T cells are found in high number within the #paracortex# (a region lying internal to the cortex, between the follicles and medulla).  Normally, this region will enlarge significantly during cell-mediated immune responses due to proliferation of cytotoxic and helper T cells.  The loss of mature T reservoirs in patients with 22qDS results in recurrent infections by viral, fungal, protozoan, and intracellular bacterial pathogens. $#(Choices A and E)#  B cells mature in the bone marrow before migrating to the periphery; in the lymph nodes, they cluster in the outer cortex as primary (inactive) follicles.  When exposed to antigens (aided by follicular T cells and dendritic cells), B cells begin proliferating and form a germinal center.  In x-linked agammaglobulinemia, B cells are unable to mature in the bone marrow, preventing migration and resulting in absent lymph node cortical follicles. $#(Choices B and C)#  The medulla of the lymph node consists of medullary cords (aggregates of reticular cells, plasma cells, and macrophages) and medullar sinuses. $#Educational objective# 22q11.2 microdeletion syndromes (eg, DiGeorge syndrome) may present with thymic hypoplasia (eg, thymic shadow attenuation).  Because the thymus is required for T-cell maturation, reservoirs that receive migrating mature T cells (eg, paracortex of lymph nodes) will be poorly developed.  In contrast, x-linked agammaglobulinemia halts B-cell maturation in the bone marrow, preventing migration to lymph node cortical follicles.  ",

However, foreign antigens can also trigger a #rapid-onset innate immune response# driven by the presence of #pattern recognition receptors# (eg, toll-like receptors) on local stromal and local/circulating immune cells (eg, #macrophages#, monocytes, mast cells). $Pattern recognition receptors identify conserved motifs present on many pathogens (eg, lipopolysaccharide).  Activation of these receptors leads to the release of #pyrogenic cytokines# (eg, TNF-alpha, IL-1, #IL-6#), which can cause #local inflammation# (eg, edema, warmth, swelling) due to increased vascular permeability/immune cell recruitment and #systemic inflammation# (eg, fever, irritability, fatigue, headache) due to increased circulating inflammatory cytokines. $Many vaccines also contain #adjuvants# (eg, aluminum salts, virosomes, oil-in-water) to increase the immune response to the injected antigen.  Adjuvants are strongly immunostimulatory and frequently increase the risk of reactogenicity.  However, manifestations of reactogenicity tend to improve 24-36 hours after vaccination. $#(Choices A and C)#  Dendritic cells are antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that display foreign antigens on their surface on major histocompatibility complex class II molecules.  CD4 T lymphocytes with antigen-specific receptors bind to the antigen on the APCs and are costimulated by the interaction between CD80/86 on the APCs and CD28 on the T-cell surface.  Activated CD4 T-cells then increase display of @CD40 ligand@, which binds CD40 on the APC, leading to full APC maturation.  These adaptive immune responses take several days to form and do not cause local reactions soon after vaccination. $#(Choice B)#  Cytotoxic T-cells recognize a foreign antigen on major histocompatibility complex class I and release perforins to induce cell lysis; they primarily attack cells infected by intracellular pathogens (eg, viruses).  Cytotoxic T-cells do not significantly contribute to vaccination reactions within hours of vaccination. $#(Choice E)#  Some activated B-cells differentiate into short-lived plasma cells that secrete IgM.

Ovarian tumor types include: $• Surface epithelial-stroma: composed of cells that support the normal ovarian structure for ovulation (eg, serous, mucinous epithelial cells). $• Sex cord-stroma: composed of cells that support and surround the oocyte.  These cells secrete sex hormones including estrogen (granulosa cells) and testosterone (Sertoli-Leydig cells). $• Germ cell: composed of cells that can develop into an embryo or placenta.  These tumors are composed of varying amounts of germ layers (ie, endoderm, mesoderm, ectoderm), yolk sac, or placenta (eg, chorion).  They often have associated hormonal activity (eg, increased hCG, alpha fetoprotein). $This patient's unintentional weight loss, hot flashes, irregular menses, and low TSH level are consistent with #thyrotoxicosis# (ie, abnormally high circulating thyroid hormone levels).  In the setting of an adnexal mass, this presentation is classic for #struma ovarii#, an ovarian #germ cell tumor# composed of >50% mature thyroid tissue (derived from the #endoderm#) that can secrete thyroid hormone.  On gross examination, struma ovarii typically appears as an oily (eg, sebaceous) cystic mass.  Microscopic examination reveals @thyroid follicles@ filled with colloid and surrounded by ovarian stroma. $#(Choice A)#  @Endometriomas@ occur when ectopic endometrial tissue and old blood collect in the ovary.  Patients can have lower abdominal pain; however, they typically have regular menses.  In addition, endometriosis is not associated with hot flashes, weight loss, or abnormal TSH levels. $#(Choice C)#  Granulosa cell tumors are a type of sex cord–stroma tumor that secrete estrogen and inhibin, thereby suppressing FSH release and causing irregular menses.  They do not secrete thyroid hormone and therefore do not cause thyrotoxicosis. $#(Choice D)#  @Ovarian fibromas@ are sex cord–stroma tumors that arise from ovarian fibroblasts, which have no endocrine activity and therefore do not affect TSH levels.  Fibromas are typically solid, not cystic. $#(Choice E)  #Ovarian thecomas are benign sex cord–stroma tumors composed of cells histologically similar to thecal cells.  Therefore, thecomas typically increase circulating estrogen (causing abnormal uterine bleeding) but do not cause thyrotoxicosis. $#Educational objective# Struma ovarii is an ovarian germ cell tumor composed of >50% mature thyroid tissue that can secrete thyroid hormone.

  "explanation_2": "This patient with menstrual irregularities, infertility, obesity, and hirsutism likely has #polycystic ovary syndrome# (#PCOS#).  The etiology is heterogeneous and multifactorial (eg, hormonal, genetic, environmental), but patients characteristically have elevated levels of both androgen and estrogen. $#Hyperandrogenism#, which can be diagnosed clinically (eg, hirsutism, acne) or biochemically (ie, elevated testosterone), occurs due to increased ovarian androgen production.  Androgens are then converted to estrogens in the peripheral adipose tissue and ovaries by the enzyme aromatase; patients with PCOS are commonly #obese# and have #increased# peripheral and ovarian #estrogen production# (ie, estrone and estradiol). $The consistent elevation in estrogen acts on the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis and causes #menstrual irregularities# and anovulatory infertility.  During a @normal menstrual cycle@, the growth of a dominant follicle causes a gradual increase in estrogen, which triggers hypothalamic GnRH release in a high-frequency pulse pattern that preferentially stimulates greater LH than FSH production in the anterior pituitary (ie, the LH surge to trigger oocyte release).  Following ovulation, GnRH release returns to a low-frequency pattern that allows FSH to stimulate the next follicular phase. $In contrast, patients with PCOS have consistently elevated estrogen levels, leading to a #persistent imbalance in the LH/FSH ratio#.  Because FSH remains low relative to LH, there is no maturation and release of a single, dominant ovarian follicle (ie, #anovulation#).  Instead, multiple, smaller follicles accumulate fluid to cause the @classic appearance@ of #bilateral, enlarged, polycystic ovaries#. $#(Choice A)#  Endometrial proliferation is estrogen dependent.  An atrophic endometrium is associated with low estrogen (eg, menopause); in contrast, patients with PCOS have chronically elevated estrogen levels and are at increased risk for endometrial hyperplasia or cancer. $#(Choices B and D)#  Cushing syndrome is caused by cortisol excess, usually due to a hyperfunctioning adrenal adenoma (which causes compensatory contralateral, not bilateral, adrenal atrophy) or an ACTH-producing pituitary adenoma.  Although Cushing syndrome and PCOS share several clinical features (eg, obesity, hirsutism, menstrual irregularities), patients with Cushing syndrome typically also have moon facies, enlarged fat pads, hypertension, and proximal muscle weakness. $#(Choice E)#  Polycystic kidney disease is an inherited condition with juvenile and adult forms.  Patients typically have hypertension, flank pain, hematuria, and renal insufficiency.  It does not cause menstrual irregularities or hirsutism. $#Educational objective# Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) may present with menstrual irregularities, signs of hyperandrogenism (eg, acne, hirsutism), and obesity.

PID occurs when a lower genital tract infection (eg, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis) compromises the endocervical barrier, allowing polymicrobial vaginal bacteria to ascend and infect the normally sterile upper genital tract (ie, uterus, fallopian tubes).  When infection spreads to the fallopian tubes, it creates an inflammatory exudate that promotes tubal wall adhesion and damage; #prolonged infection# can result in permanent tubal scarring and obstruction that impede the fertilization and/or implantation of future pregnancies (ie, #tubal factor infertility#, ectopic pregnancy). $To prevent these complications, patients with PID require a #broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen# with coverage for N gonorrhoeae, C trachomatis, and polymicrobial vaginal flora.  Treatment typically consists of a cephalosporin (eg, ceftriaxone), doxycycline, and metronidazole.  Ceftriaxone covers gram-negative bacteria (eg, N gonorrhoeae), doxycycline covers gram-positive and atypical organisms (eg, C trachomatis), and metronidazole covers anaerobic bacteria (eg, Gardnerella vaginalis).  This patient received #incomplete antibiotic treatment# (ceftriaxone only), which likely led to a persisting or prolonged infection and increased risk for tubal scarring. $#(Choice A)#  Advanced maternal age (ie, age ≥35) is associated with decreased fertility due to the diminishing quantity and quality of oocytes as women approach menopause (average age: 51). $#(Choice B)#  Chronic ovulatory dysfunction (eg, @polycystic ovary syndrome@) is a common cause of infertility; however, this diagnosis is unlikely in this patient with regular, monthly (ie, ovulatory) menses. $#(Choice D)#  Long-term oral contraceptive use is not associated with infertility.  Shortly after oral contraceptives are discontinued, patients typically resume menses and return to their baseline fertility level. $#Educational objective# Tubal factor infertility, which occurs due to tubal scarring and obstruction, is a complication of pelvic inflammatory disease.  The risk for permanent tubal scarring increases with inadequate antibiotic treatment due to persisting or prolonged infection of the upper genital tract.  ",

In the setting of a #positive pregnancy test# (eg, detectable β-hCG) and an #adnexal mass#, her presentation is most concerning for #ectopic pregnancy#. $Following ovulation, the ovum normally travels along the length of the fallopian tube where it can be fertilized by a sperm cell.  The fertilized ovum continues through the fallopian tube, developing into a blastocyst, and subsequently implants on the uterine endometrium.  However, migration of the fertilized ovum is occasionally impeded, resulting in #implantation in the fallopian tube# (~90%) or other @extrauterine locations@.  Ectopic pregnancy often occurs secondary to tubal pathology (eg, pelvic inflammatory disease, prior pelvic surgery) but can present in patients without risk factors. $After implantation in the fallopian tube, the ectopic pregnancy develops into a highly vascular adnexal mass that draws blood flow from surrounding tissues to maintain its rapid growth.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient's rash that resolved with use of a barrier ointment was likely #irritant contact diaper dermatitis#, the most #common# diaper rash in infants.  Characteristic features include erythematous papules confined within the diaper area.  In contrast to @candidal diaper dermatitis@, another common diaper rash caused by a secondary yeast infection, irritant contact diaper dermatitis does not have skinfold involvement or satellite lesions (ie, discrete lesions beyond the borders of the main rash). $Irritant contact diaper dermatitis is predominantly caused by #skin barrier breakdown# from exposure to urine and stool trapped within the diaper.  Patients with frequent stooling (eg, diarrhea) are at increased risk because urease produced by #fecal bacteria# causes an #increase in local skin pH#, which allows for activation of proteolytic enzymes that disrupt the stratum corneum.  Areas of macerated skin are then prone to frictional damage from the diaper, which further exacerbates the rash. $The #treatment# for irritant contact diaper dermatitis is a thick #barrier ointment# (eg, petrolatum) or paste (eg, zinc oxide), which provides the skin an adherent layer of protection from contact with the stool and urine.  Other measures to reduce irritant exposure include frequent diaper changes and diaper-free periods. $#(Choice A)#  Abnormal keratin expression describes the pathogenesis of psoriasis, which manifests as erythematous, scaly plaques.  Psoriasis rarely presents in the diaper area and is usually chronic and persistent without topical corticosteroid treatment. $#(Choice C)#  Increased hapten sensitization describes allergic contact dermatitis, which is uncommon in the diaper area but can occur with an allergy to a component (eg, dye, fragrance) in diapers or wipes.  The rash is unlikely to resolve without complete removal of the offending antigen (eg, changing diaper brand), and topical corticosteroids are also required in many cases. $#(Choice D)#  Local bacterial colonization with Staphylococcus or Streptococcus leads to impetigo in the diaper area.  Honey-crusted pustules are classic, and topical antibiotics are the first-line treatment. $#(Choice E)#  Scabies is a mite infestation that causes itchy, erythematous papules.  The rash can involve the diaper area, but lesions would also be expected elsewhere (eg, axillae, hands, feet).  Treatment is with permethrin, and resolution would not be expected with petrolatum alone. $#Educational objective# Irritant contact diaper dermatitis is the most common diaper rash and is characterized by skin barrier breakdown as a result of exposure to fecal bacteria that causes increased local skin pH.  Treatment is with a barrier ointment that prevents skin contact with urine and stool.  ",

Raising of the lesion above the surrounding skin (tissue overgrowth) is further consistent with excessive proliferation of granulation tissue (ie, @hypergranulation tissue@) at the site of wound healing. $Granulation tissue is an essential component of the proliferative phase of normal wound healing, providing the nutrients and structure needed for a wound to fill and reepithelialize.  Platelets and macrophages in and around a healing wound produce vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which induces the vascular and fibroblast proliferation of granulation tissue. $However, if #VEGF-induced tissue proliferation# continues unchecked, the resulting hypergranulation tissue prevents wound epithelialization and remodeling.  These lesions most often occur at the site of nasogastric tubes or wounds left to #heal by secondary intention# (ie, the wound is purposely left open). $#(Choice A)#  Cutaneous amyloidosis is caused by the deposition of insoluble fibers derived from precursor proteins (eg, immunoglobulin light chains) into the superficial dermis.  It can have a varied gross appearance (eg, macular, nodular, lichenous) but would be characterized histologically by homogenous, @eosinophilic dermal deposits@. $#(Choice B)#  During the remodeling phase of wound healing, fibroblasts and type III collagen in granulation tissue are gradually (ie, over weeks to years) replaced with myofibroblasts and type I collagen, forming a scar.

Fibrils form within premelanosomes, creating a scaffold that will bind and concentrate the melanin pigment within the organelles.  $2. Endosomes within the melanocyte then transport enzymes (eg, tyrosinase) to premelanosomes.  $3. @Tyrosinase@ catalyzes the first step (ie, oxidation of tyrosine to DOPA) of melanogenesis, leading to the production of black-brown eumelanin and yellow-red pheomelanin.  $4. Melanized melanosomes are transferred via dendritic branches into neighboring keratinocytes, where they are then arranged around the cell nucleus to protect the DNA. $This patient with diffuse lack of pigmentation and light sensitivity likely has #oculocutaneous albinism# (OCA), a condition characterized by impaired production or distribution of melanin, particularly eumelanin.  Isolated OCA is most often caused by autosomal recessive mutations causing #dysfunctional melanin synthesis# within melanosomes (most commonly tyrosinase or P protein [regulates melanosome pH]), resulting in low or often completely absent melanin production. $Characteristic findings of OCA include diffuse white hair and skin and light irides.  #Photophobia# is common because @translucent irides@ allow in excess light.  Because eumelanin protects against ultraviolet damage, patients with OCA are predisposed to #sunburns#, as in this boy.

Melanized melanosome numbers may be decreased, which is secondary to reduced melanin production and not the primary mechanism of pigmentation defects in OCA. $#(Choice C)#  Uptake of melanin by keratinocytes is disrupted in Chédiak-Higashi syndrome due to a defect in organelle trafficking.  Patients have OCA, but recurrent pyogenic infections and coagulopathy would also be expected in early childhood. $#(Choice E)#  Impaired differentiation of neural crest cells into melanocytes is a rare cause of scattered areas of depigmentation in piebaldism and Waardenburg syndrome.

  "explanation_2": "The distribution and appearance of this patient's rash is characteristic of #scabies#.  Scabies is due to an infestation by Sarcoptes scabiei, a mite that burrows into the epidermis and deposits eggs.  Weeks after initial infection, patients develop a delayed type IV hypersensitivity reaction to the mite, mite feces, and mite eggs. $Presentation includes @erythematous papules@ that are #intensely pruritic#, particularly at #night#.  The classic @distribution@ of lesions includes the extremities (eg, interdigital web spaces, flexor wrist surfaces, feet), axillae, umbilicus, and genitalia. $Scabies is highly contagious and spreads via direct #person-to-person contact#, and history often reveals a #roommate# or family member with a #similar rash#.  Although less common, fomite transmission (eg, clothing) can also occur because mites survive 2-3 days off the skin. $#(Choice A)#  @Folliculitis@ from exposure to water contaminated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa presents as tender, pruritic papules or pustules on exposed areas, and symptoms typically self-resolve within 2 weeks.  This patient's rash duration and distribution make this diagnosis unlikely. $#(Choice B)#  Incomplete vaccination against varicella-zoster virus (VZV) increases the risk for chickenpox, which presents with fever (not seen here) followed by a pruritic, vesicular rash.  Lesions are not common on the soles, and the rash typically crusts over and resolves in 1-2 weeks.  VZV reactivation can present as @herpes zoster@, which may begin as erythematous papules but are typically painful and limited to a single dermatome. $#(Choice C)#  Hiking in wooded areas increases the risk for poison ivy exposure or tick-borne diseases (eg, Lyme disease).  Although contact dermatitis due to @poison ivy@ causes an intensely pruritic rash, lesions are often linear (where the plant touched the skin) and on exposed surfaces.  In addition, the rash typically resolves within 2-3 weeks.  Lyme disease causes @erythema migrans@, an expanding macular rash not seen in this patient. $#(Choice E)#  Syphilis, which causes a painless genital ulcer, spreads via sexual contact, and manifestations of @secondary syphilis@ include a maculopapular rash involving the palms and soles.  Unlike this case, however, most patients also have constitutional symptoms (eg, fever) and lymphadenopathy. $#Educational objective# Scabies causes an intensely pruritic, papular rash involving the hands, feet, and genitalia.  Transmission is via direct person-to-person contact, and history often reveals a roommate or family member with a similar rash.  ",

The risk is greatest for those with a positive family history or those of East Asian descent. $During the adolescent growth spurt, the axial length of the globe also grows rapidly, making the incidence of new-onset myopia highest in this age group.

Lesions that impact the macula can lead to loss of a portion of the central visual field, which is called a #central scotoma#.  A scotoma is any visual defect surrounded by a relatively unimpaired field of vision.  They most often occur due to pathology involving parts of the retina or optic nerve. $The macula is located near the center of the retina.  It is characterized histologically by the presence of densely packed cones, few overlying cells, and no blood vessels.  Each macular cone synapses to a single bipolar cell, which synapses to a single ganglion cell (in contrast to the peripheral retina, where multiple cones converge onto a single ganglion cell).  Because of this arrangement, visual acuity in the macula, and particularly the fovea, is greater than in any other area of the retina.  Loss of vision in this area is particularly debilitating, and AMD is the most common cause of blindness in patients >age 50 in the United States. $#(Choice A)#  An arcuate scotoma is an arc-shaped visual field defect extending from the blind spot (the area of the optic nerve head that does not process visual information) that follows the bending course of the retinal nerve fibers.  It most classically occurs due to glaucoma; funduscopic examination often shows an increased cup/disc ratio. $#(Choice B)#  Binasal hemianopia is a loss of vision in the nasal fields of both eyes.  This information does not cross at the optic chiasm but travels at its lateral edge.  For a lesion to produce binasal hemianopia, it would have to impact the lateral optic chiasm on both sides. $#(Choice C)#  Bitemporal hemianopia is a loss of vision in the temporal fields of both eyes.  Fibers from the nasal retina cross the midline at the optic chiasm, so lesions that compress the center of the optic chiasm (eg, pituitary adenoma) can cause bitemporal hemianopia. $#(Choice E)#  Homonymous hemianopia is a loss of vision in the same side of the visual field in both eyes.  It occurs with lesions posterior to the optic chiasm, which would not lead to changes in the funduscopic examination. $#Educational objective# A scotoma is a discrete visual field defect.

Examination reveals cloudiness in the lens, decreased detail when examining the retina, and loss of the @red reflex@. $Transparency of the lens requires an ordered epithelial cell structure and maintenance of intracellular crystallins.  #Aging #and environmental stressors can disrupt transparency and contribute to cataract formation through the following mechanisms: $• #Nuclear sclerosis#: new layers of epithelia form on the cortex of the lens, compacting older layers beneath $• #Photooxidative damage# and cross-linking of crystallins causes brown/yellow pigmentary changes $• #Osmotic injury# resulting in development of hydropic lens fibers that degenerate $Cumulative photooxidative stress is worsened by heavy #UV exposure# (eg, outdoor occupations), smoking, or ionizing radiation.  Likewise, osmotic injury is accelerated in patients with diabetes mellitus.

It reduces the ability of the eye to focus on near objects but does not cause loss of visual acuity. $#Educational objective# Cataracts are characterized by progressive opacification of the lens with chronic loss of visual acuity.  Aging and environmental exposures (eg, UV light) contribute to cataract formation by inducing nuclear sclerosis, photooxidative damage to lens crystallins, and osmotic injury.  ",

CF is an inherited, multisystem disorder characterized by the abnormal transport of sodium and chloride due to a mutation in the @CFTR gene@.  Although common CF mutations (eg, ΔF508) are often identified on newborn screening, less common mutations may go undetected and cause milder symptoms later in childhood. $Abnormal CFTR function causes thick, viscous respiratory secretions and impaired mucociliary clearance, leading to chronic sinopulmonary disease (eg, #chronic rhinosinusitis#).  Patients typically have chronic cough, nasal congestion, and facial pain, as seen in this patient.  Bilateral #nasal polyps#, benign outgrowths of inflamed mucosa, are also common due to chronic infection and present as nontender, shiny, gray masses in the nasal cavity or paranasal sinuses. $In CF, viscous secretions can also block pancreatic ducts, leading to #pancreatic insufficiency#.  Decreased or absent pancreatic enzymes cause fat malabsorption with oily, #loose stools# and #failure to thrive# and/or #weight loss#.  Over time, pancreatic injury can also lead to insufficient insulin production and CF-related diabetes. $#(Choice B)#  HIV infection causes chronic infections and weight loss.  However, without a known exposure (eg, blood transfusion), most pediatric HIV cases are transmitted perinatally; these patients typically develop symptoms by age 2, unlike this patient, who is age 7.  In addition, nasal polyposis is rare with HIV. $#(Choice C)#  Nasopharyngeal carcinoma presents with a nasopharyngeal mass that may cause facial pain and associated weight loss.  However, the tumor is typically unilateral, and the diagnosis is usually in patients age >50. $#(Choice D)#  Primary ciliary dyskinesia can present similarly to CF, with chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyposis due to impaired mucociliary clearance.  However, failure to thrive and weight loss are not associated with this disorder. $#(Choice E)#  Seasonal allergic rhinitis is a risk factor for developing sinus infections and nasal polyposis but would not cause weight loss. $#Educational objective# Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis in children should prompt evaluation for cystic fibrosis, especially when signs of pancreatic insufficiency (eg, loose stools, failure to thrive, weight loss) are present.

This patient's #brief# (<1min), #episodic# vertigo triggered by #head position# changes (eg, sitting up from bed, looking around a kitchen) is consistent with #benign paroxysmal positional vertigo# (BPPV), the most common cause of vertigo. $Rotational head movement is sensed by the semicircular canals, which are filled with endolymphatic fluid.  The relative movement of this fluid stimulates hair cells that generate electrical impulses which are transmitted to the brain.  BPPV is most often attributed to #canalithiasis#, or the presence of crystalline debris (canaliths) in the semicircular canals.  These canaliths disrupt the normal flow of fluid in the semicircular canals, leading to contradictory signaling from the corresponding canals. $Diagnosis is based on clinical features.  The @Dix-Hallpike maneuver@ can help diagnose BPPV: vertigo and nystagmus are triggered as the patient quickly lies back into a supine position with the head rotated 45 degrees.  No further workup is needed in patients with classic presentations.  Treatment with #canalith repositioning maneuvers# (eg, @Epley@) is typically effective. $#(Choices A and E)#  Carotid baroreceptor dysfunction can lead to wide fluctuations in blood pressure.  Hypoperfusion due to this or other causes (eg, arterial stenosis) can lead to lightheadedness, which is frequently interpreted by patients as dizziness.  However, this patient's positive Dix-Hallpike and spinning sensation (vs lightheadedness) are more consistent with BPPV. $#(Choice B)#  Elevated endolymphatic pressure in the semicircular canals is thought to underly the development of Ménière disease.  In contrast to this patient's presentation, Ménière disease classically presents with episodic vertigo lasting 20 minutes to 24 hours and is associated with unilateral hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness. $#(Choice C)#  Infected fluid in the middle ear (ie, @acute otitis media@) can lead to elevated hydrostatic pressure in the middle ear, causing a bulging tympanic membrane and sometimes leading to tympanic membrane rupture.  However, acute otitis media presents with pain, fevers, and hearing loss, features absent in this patient. $#Educational objective# Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo causes brief (<1 min) episodes of vertigo triggered by changes in head position.

  "explanation_2": "#Acute salicylate intoxication# typically presents with nausea/vomiting, dizziness, confusion, #tinnitus# (eg, ringing/buzzing sound), #fever#, and #tachypnea# within several hours after ingestion.  Two different acid-base abnormalities are characteristic: $• #Primary respiratory alkalosis# occurs because salicylates directly stimulate the medullary respiratory center, resulting in increased ventilation and loss of CO2 in the expired air. $• #Primary anion gap metabolic acidosis# develops because toxic salicylate levels increase lipolysis, uncouple oxidative phosphorylation, and inhibit the citric acid cycle.  This results in the accumulation of unmeasured organic acids in the blood (eg, ketoacids, lactate), increasing the anion gap. $Therefore, salicylate toxicity classically presents with a #mixed acid-base disturbance#, with @arterial blood gas@ sometimes showing a #pH within the normal range# as the 2 primary disturbances shift the pH in opposite directions.  There is #low serum HCO3-# due to primary metabolic acidosis and #low PaCO2# due to both respiratory compensation for the metabolic acidosis and the primary respiratory alkalosis.  Because of the mixed disturbance, the #PaCO2 is lower than expected# for respiratory @compensation@ alone (ie, per Winters' formula the expected PaCO2 due to respiratory compensation is ~23 mm Hg, but the primary increase in central respiratory drive pushes PaCO2 even lower). $#(Choice A)#  Low pH with elevated PaCO2 is consistent with primary respiratory acidosis, which can occur with the respiratory depression seen with opioid overdose.  HCO3- is slightly elevated, which is consistent with the small degree of metabolic compensation that occurs in the acute setting; full metabolic compensation requires approximately 72 hours. $#(Choice C)#  These values are consistent with normal acid-base status. $#(Choice D)#  High pH with elevated HCO3- represents primary metabolic alkalosis, which can occur with intractable vomiting.  PaCO2 is elevated and consistent with appropriate respiratory compensation. $#(Choice E)#  High pH with low PaCO2 and near normal HCO3- represent primary respiratory alkalosis with minimal metabolic compensation.  This can occur with any cause of acute hyperventilation (eg, panic attack). $#Educational objective# Salicylate intoxication should be suspected in patients with the triad of fever, tinnitus, and tachypnea.  Salicylates both stimulate central respiratory drive to cause primary respiratory alkalosis and disrupt cellular metabolism to cause primary anion gap metabolic acidosis.  Therefore, toxicity classically presents with a mixed acid-base disturbance and a blood pH sometimes within the normal range.  ",

This constellation of findings warrants evaluation for #chronic mercury toxicity#. $Manifestations of mercury poisoning include the following: $• Cardiovascular/sympathetic nervous system:  Mercury #inactivates catechol O-methyltransferase#, an enzyme responsible for catecholamine breakdown.  Therefore, mercury toxicity leads to increased serum and urinary epinephrine and norepinephrine, causing excess stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system (similar to pheochromocytoma).  Symptoms include #diaphoresis, tachycardia, hypertension#, and #anxiety#. $• #Neuropsychiatric#:  Mercury can cross the blood-brain barrier and deposit in the CNS, specifically the cerebral cortex, leading to a range of psychiatric and motor symptoms (eg, personality changes, #insomnia, tremor#); photophobia may also be seen. $• Dermatologic:  Mercury toxicity, particularly in children, can lead to a #hypersensitivity rash# (acrodynia).  A diffuse, pruritic body rash or a desquamating, pink rash on the palms and soles is characteristic. $Exposure to mercury is usually occupational (eg, gold miner).

Most cases occur in individuals from endemic regions (eg, eastern Mediterranean, Middle East, South America, sub-Saharan Africa, former Soviet Union, western China) or those residing in the southwestern United States with #sheep# and #dog# (participate in the tapeworm life cycle) exposure.  Initial infection is generally asymptomatic, with subsequent manifestations depending on cyst location and size.  The #liver# is often affected (leading to hepatomegaly or right upper quadrant pain), but other organs such as the lungs or muscles can be involved.  Unilocular lesions are typical of E granulosus, and multilocular lesions are typical of E multilocularis. $When infection occurs, echinococcal larvae implant within the capillaries, triggering an inflammatory reaction involving monocytes and eosinophils.  Some larvae encyst.  Microscopic examination demonstrates an encapsulated and calcified cyst (\"#eggshell calcification#\") containing fluid and budding cells that will eventually become daughter cysts.  The outer wall is composed of gelatinous sheets surrounded by a thick fibrous capsule.  Imaging (ultrasound, CT, MRI) and serology testing can be used for diagnosis. $Depending on the size of the cyst, surgery and adjunctive chemotherapy (eg, albendazole) are the treatment of choice for symptomatic patients.  Cyst manipulation (eg, surgery, aspiration) should be performed with caution, as spilling of cyst contents can cause #anaphylactic shock#, which likely occurred in this patient. $#(Choices B, C, D, and E)#  Fulminant liver failure can arise due to numerous conditions, including viral hepatitis, acetaminophen toxicity, idiosyncratic drug reactions, or Wilson disease.  Hypovolemia is typically caused by severe blood loss, although excessive loss of other bodily fluids (eg, diarrhea, vomiting, burns, dehydration) may also be responsible.  Pulmonary emboli are typically caused by the propagation of venous thrombi, with less common sources including air bubbles, fat droplets, amniotic fluid, or clumps of parasites or malignant cells.  Overwhelming systemic infection with bacterial organisms can cause septic shock (hypotension, low blood flow).  None of these conditions is typically associated with hydatid cysts. $#Educational objective# Echinococcus granulosus is the most common cause of hydatid cysts.  Spilling of cyst contents can cause anaphylactic shock.  Surgical manipulation should be performed with caution.  "

One of the major changes in the cardiovascular system involves #decreased responsiveness to adrenergic stimuli#, which contributes to a lower maximal heart rate and #reduced maximal cardiac output#. $#Critical illness# often involves a #hypermetabolic state# (ie, increased resting energy expenditure) and a marked decrease in intravascular blood volume (eg, evaporative losses with severe burn injury, vascular leakage with sepsis), both of which necessitate a sympathetic-mediated increase in heart rate and contractility to help maintain organ and tissue perfusion.  The attenuation of this response with age likely contributes to poorer critical illness outcomes in elderly patients. $#(Choices B and E)#  Compliance of the aorta and other large arteries decreases with age, resulting in isolated systolic hypertension and an increase in left ventricular afterload.  In response to the increased afterload, mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy occurs, resulting in increased left ventricular wall thickness.  The reduced arterial compliance also decreases blood volume retained in the arterial system, which increases susceptibility to hypotension during critical illness. $#(Choices C and F)#  Degeneration of lung elastin with age causes alveolar enlargement and increased air trapping.  The alveolar enlargement decreases the percentage of the alveolar surface in contact with alveolar capillaries, reducing gas exchange surface area.  This effect, combined with reduced alveolar ventilation due to increased air trapping, increases ventilation-perfusion mismatching. $#(Choice D)#  Diaphragmatic strength decreases with age.

These changes include reduced maximal heart rate and cardiac output due to decreased responsiveness to adrenergic stimuli, reduced retention of arterial blood volume due to decreased arterial compliance, and reduced respiratory strength and gas exchange efficiency.

  "explanation_2": "This newborn has edema involving the hands and feet.  Edema develops due to accumulation of fluid in the interstitial space.  It can be categorized as pitting (ie, makes a physical indentation with applied pressure) or nonpitting. $• Pitting edema typically results when there is increased fluid extravasation into the interstitial space.  Common causes include increased capillary hydrostatic pressure (eg, right-sided heart failure, venous thrombosis) and decreased intravascular oncotic pressure (eg, nephrotic-range proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia in cirrhosis) #(choice D).# $• #Nonpitting edema# occurs when there is impaired drainage of excess interstitial water due to lymphatic obstruction (eg, malignancy, congenital hypoplasia) or accumulation of water-binding mucopolysaccharides in the interstitial space (ie, pretibial myxedema in hypothyroidism).  Increased capillary permeability (eg, angioedema) also characteristically causes nonpitting due to rapid extravasation of protein-rich fluid that overwhelms the normal drainage pathways #(choice C).# $In this case, the patient has nonpitting edema in addition to a webbed neck, nail dysplasia, and #horseshoe kidney#, a constellation of findings that is characteristic of @Turner syndrome@ (TS).  Swelling occurs in more than half of patients with TS and is due to #lymphatic network dysgenesis# causing @congenital lymphedema@.  Poor lymph absorption leads to the accumulation of fluid in the interstitial space of the hands and feet.  Impaired drainage of cervical lymph results in formation of a #webbed neck# (ie, short neck with loose skin), and severe obstruction of lymphatic vessels can result in @cystic hygroma@ and hydrops fetalis. $#(Choice A)#  Sodium (and therefore fluid) retention occurs with kidney failure and causes increased capillary hydrostatic pressure and edema that is pitting, in contrast to this patient's nonpitting edema.  In addition, although patients with TS are predisposed to horseshoe kidney, renal function is usually normal. $#(Choice B)#  Impaired left ventricle contractility initially causes left-sided heart failure and presents with signs of pulmonary edema, such as increased work of breathing (eg, tachypnea), hypoxia, and crackles (findings not seen in this patient).  Over time, increased pulmonary pressure can cause increased central venous pressure and lead to right-sided heart failure, but edema would be pitting, unlike the edema in this patient. $#Educational objective# Nonpitting edema often develops due to lymphatic outflow obstruction (eg, malignancy, congenital malformation).  Congenital lymphedema due to lymphatic network dysgenesis is common in Turner syndrome, which is also characteristically associated with webbed neck, horseshoe kidney, and nail dysplasia.  ",

He subsequently developed #mononucleosis-like symptoms# (eg, fever, night sweats, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, leukopenia) with biopsy showing large, @atypical B cells@ completely effacing the lymph node architecture.  This constellation of findings likely indicates #posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder# (PTLD). $PTLD is a plasmocytic or lymphoid proliferation that occurs in the weeks or months following solid-organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.  It is generally caused by proliferation of #Epstein-Barr virus# (EBV) in donor or host cells due to #reduced cytotoxic T-cell immunosurveillance# from high dose #immunosuppressive therapy#. $EBV replication promotes #B-cell proliferation# due to the expression of viral membrane proteins (latent membrane protein 1/2A) that mimic B-cell antigen stimulation signals; it also promotes #B-cell survival# due to the expression of viral nuclear transcription factors (EBNA-2/LP) that activate host survival genes.  These virus-mediated changes generate #immortalized plasmocytic or lymphoid cells# that proliferate widely in the reticuloendothelial system, leading to lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and B-symptoms (eg, fever, night sweats). $#(Choice A)#  Invasive aspergillosis is common in those with profound neutropenia following transplantation.  However, it primarily affects the lung (not lymph nodes) and is marked by fungi with septate hyaline @hyphae and acute angle branching@.  Tissue necrosis, hemorrhage, and invasion of tissue planes are prominent. $#(Choice B)#  Bartonella henselae infection causes cat-scratch disease, which is associated with regional lymphadenopathy.  Histopathology demonstrates necrotizing granulomatous adenitis with multinucleated giant cells, stellate granulomas, and microabscesses.  Specialized stains can reveal the bacterium. $#(Choice C)#  Patients with severe immunocompromisation from AIDS or immunosuppressive medications can develop Cryptococcus neoformans infection, which usually presents with meningoencephalitis (eg, headache, vomiting, confusion) or pneumonitis.  Disseminated infection is less common and primarily affects the skin and skeletal system.  In addition, histopathology will show @budding, encapsulated yeasts@. $#(Choice E)#  Chronic or reactivated parvovirus infection can occur in severely immunosuppressed individuals.  Although this frequently causes fever, fatigue, and (sometimes) leukopenia, most cases are marked by severe anemia due to red cell aplasia.  In addition, generalized lymphadenopathy would be atypical. $#Educational objective# Posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder occurs in patients who have undergone solid-organ or stem cell transplantation and are taking high-dose immunosuppressive medications.  Most cases are caused by the reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus, which generates viral proteins that stimulate B-cell proliferation and survival.  Patients usually have mononucleosis-like symptoms.",
