The image shows a typical #large yeast# with a single, #broad-based bud#.  The mold form (branching hyphae) predominates in the environment, at average temperatures of 25-30 C. $Infection occurs by inhalation of aerosolized fungus from the environment.

However, these compounds fail to eliminate P aeruginosa and ultimately cause progressive destruction of the airway wall (ie, bronchiectasis) and a steady decline in pulmonary function. $#(Choices A and D)#  Pathogenic strains of H influenzae are able to form biofilms but do not convert to mucoid phenotype.  S aureus can generate a biofilm and convert to mucoid growth.  Although H influenzae and S aureus are the leading respiratory pathogens in children with CF, neither is as common as Pseudomonas in adult patients with CF. $#(Choice B)#  Klebsiella pneumoniae can generate a thick biofilm and grows in @mucoid colonies@ on blood agar.

Antibodies against the polysaccharide capsule are generated during infection and provide long-lasting immunity against that strain. $The pneumococcal vaccine contains polysaccharide antigens from the most common disease-causing serotypes leading to the generation of protective antibodies against these strains.  In the United States, 2 types of pneumococcal vaccinations are available:  $1. #Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine# contains capsular material from 23 serotypes.  Because polysaccharides cannot be displayed by the major histocompatibility complex of antigen-presenting cells (only peptides can), immunogenicity to this vaccine is T-cell independent and generates a mild antibody response with no memory cells.  Although polysaccharide vaccines are fairly effective for most adult patients, they are not useful for infants (age <2).  $2. #Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine# consists of capsular polysaccharides from 13 serotypes that have been covalently attached to recombinant, inactivated diphtheria toxin.  Protein conjugation allows the polysaccharide to be displayed by the major histocompatibility complex and induces a much stronger immunogenic response that involves T-cell–mediated B-lymphocyte activation.

After a few weeks, infected macrophages in the draining lymphatic system display mycobacterial antigens on major histocompatibility complex @(MHC) class II@ molecules, leading to the #stimulation of CD4 T lymphocytes#. $Stimulated CD4 cells #release interferon-gamma# that activates macrophages, greatly increasing their ability to kill phagocytized organisms.  Activated macrophages can also differentiate into epithelioid histiocytes and coalesce into #multinucleated Langhans giant cells# that wall off mycobacteria within granulomas.  The center of the granuloma is acidic and hypoxic, which causes it to appear acellular, necrotic, and \"cheese-like\" (#caseating#).

Macrophages are particularly important for the elimination of certain intracellular infections such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis.  Although tuberculosis can be associated with @pulmonary cavitation@, the cavitations usually form in the upper lobes and generally take months to develop. $#(Choice D)#  Major basic protein is the predominant component of eosinophilic granules and plays a crucial role in the elimination of parasites.  Lung abscess formation is primarily mediated by neutrophils, not eosinophils. $#(Choice E)#  Transforming growth factor-beta is secreted by inflammatory cells and results in the recruitment of fibroblasts and the deposition of connective tissue.  This cytokine contributes to scar formation after injury and plays a role in the fibrosis seen with chronic inflammation. $#Educational objective# Abscess formation is largely driven by neutrophil recruitment and activation leading to the release of cytotoxic granules that kill bacteria but also cause liquefying necrosis of surrounding tissue.

Lobar pneumonia is characterized by a step-wise inflammatory response, as follows: $ 1. #Congestion# (day 0-2) – Neutrophils respond to bacterial components (eg, peptidoglycan) by releasing cytokines that #increase the permeability# of the pulmonary capillary endothelium, which allows circulating immune cells to more easily migrate to the area.  Increased capillary permeability also leads to the accumulation of erythrocytes and #abundant proteinaceous fluid# in the alveolar space, resulting in the affected lobe becoming heavy and red. $ 2. #Red hepatization# (day 2-4) – The proteinaceous fluid transforms into fibrin strands, resulting in a confluent exudate of fibrin, neutrophils, and erythrocytes.  On gross examination, the lobe appears #liver-like#: Red, firm, and airless. $ 3. #Gray hepatization# (day 4-7) – Red cell disintegration along with increased leukocyte infiltration causes the lung to appear gray rather than red.  Neutrophils begin to be replaced by #macrophages# that begin the repair process. $ 4. #Resolution# (>7 days) – Macrophages secrete digestive enzymes that liquefy the fibrinous exudate, which is reabsorbed, expectorated, or phagocytized by macrophages.  The lung parenchyma regains its normal appearance by approximately 3 weeks. $ Besides lobar pneumonia, there are 2 other major morphologic categories of pneumonia.  #Bronchopneumonia# is an infection of the terminal bronchioles that results in patchy consolidation of a number of lobules.  @Interstitial pneumonia@ is an infection of the interstitial tissue of the lung with minimal or no alveolar infiltrate; atypical pneumonias (eg, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae) are often associated with an interstitial infiltrate. $ (Choice A)  Cardiogenic pulmonary edema is characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the alveoli due to elevations in hydrostatic pressure within the pulmonary capillaries.

The hypersecretion of mucous can lead to chronic productive cough, dyspnea, and wheezes on examination.  Lobar infiltrate is uncommon as the alveoli are not primarily affected. $ Educational objective Lobar pneumonia is marked by the cytokine-mediated accumulation of neutrophils and proteinaceous material in the alveoli.

The most likely cause is the dimorphic fungus #Histoplasma capsulatum#, which exists as a mold in the soil of the #Ohio# and Mississippi River Valleys (midwestern/central United States). $ The pathogen is inhaled into the lungs, where it converts to yeast form and is phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages.  Macrophages cannot initially eliminate the organism due to microbial virulence factors that prevent phagolysosome formation and acidification.  Therefore, H capsulatum is able to replicate within the macrophage and spread through the draining #lymphatic system# and (often) into the reticuloendothelial system (eg, #spleen#, liver). $ After about 2 weeks, patients with intact immunity develop a cell-mediated immune response that contains the infection within granulomas.  Over time, the granulomas fibrose and #calcify# and can be visualized on radiographic imaging at the initial sites of infection (eg, lungs, hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes, spleen).  In healthy patients, most infections with H capsulatum are asymptomatic and are therefore often discovered incidentally during evaluation for an unrelated condition (eg, nephrolithiasis). $ (Choice B)  Metastatic cancer often causes @multiple lung lesions@.  However, these lesions generally enlarge in size over time and calcification is rare. $ (Choice C)  @Miliary tuberculosis@ is marked by multiple pulmonary lesions and clinical illness (eg, fever, night sweats); calcified lesions would be atypical.  Although primary tuberculosis is often associated with a calcified lung and an ipsilateral hilar lymph node lesion (Ranke complex), tuberculosis is unlikely in this case given the patient's negative tuberculin skin test. $ (Choice D)  Parathyroid adenoma is a benign tumor that does not spread to the lungs; it is often associated with hypercalcemia due to increased secretion of parathyroid hormone.  Although metastatic calcification can be a rare manifestion of hyperparathyroidism (it is more common with end-stage renal disease), such patients would almost certainly have systemic signs of hypercalcemia (eg, weakness, fatigue, depressed mood). $ (Choice E)  Silica inhalation can cause innumerable, small, rounded opacities in the upper lobes of the lungs that may fibrose over time, resulting in pulmonary disease.  Silica exposure is primarily occupational (eg, miners, sandblasters). $ Educational objective Histoplasma capsulatum replicates within macrophages and often spreads from the lungs through the pulmonary lymphatics to the reticuloendothelial system (eg, spleen, liver).  Most healthy individuals quickly contain the infection within granulomas and do not become ill; a minority develop self-limited pneumonia.  Over time, the granulomas at the initial sites of infection calcify and may be seen incidentally on radiographic imaging.","clickable_1":"images/img1.15061.jpg","clickable_2":"images/img2.15061.jpg"},

Most but not all transplant centers practice universal prophylaxis for lung transplant recipients (eg, valganciclovir). $CMV is an #enveloped double-stranded DNA# virus belonging to the Herpesviridae family.  Major risk groups for infections include transplant patients, patients with HIV, and fetuses (congenital infections).  CMV #pneumonitis #is the most common form of tissue-invasive CMV following lung transplantation; other organ-specific disease manifestions (eg, esophagitis, colitis, and retinitis) occur more frequently in patients with HIV. $Biopsy findings consistent with CMV include enlarged cells with #intranuclear and intracytoplasmic inclusions# (viral particles); there is often a surrounding halo (#owl's eye#). $#(Choices B, D, and E)#  Influenza viruses are enveloped single-stranded RNA viruses.  Rhinovirus (a cause of the common cold) is a nonenveloped single-stranded RNA virus.  Adenovirus is a nonenveloped double-stranded DNA virus.  Although these viruses can cause respiratory illness, this patient's clinical features (2 weeks of progressive symptoms, impaired pulmonary function, no upper respiratory infection symptoms) and histologic findings make post-transplant CMV pneumonitis a more likely diagnosis, particularly given the lack of CMV prophylaxis. $#(Choice C)#  Organs affected by Nocardia and Actinomyces show filamentous branching beaded gram-positive rods in Gram stain preparations.  Nocardia is aerobic and positive for modified acid-fast stain; Actinomyces is anaerobic and negative for modified acid-fast stain. $#(Choice F)#  Histopathologic and cytologic findings in Pneumocystis jirovecii@ pneumonia (PCP)@ include eosinophilic foamy alveolar material and cystic and trophic forms that can be stained with Giemsa or @silver stain@ (producing a cup-in-saucer appearance).
