  "explanation_2": "This patient with signs of a sinus infection (eg, thick, purulent nasal drainage) has a history of recurrent skin abscesses and chronic atopic dermatitis.  Given her normal platelet count, which excludes Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, her findings are most consistent with #hyper-IgE syndrome #(Job syndrome), an autosomal dominant, primary immunodeficiency disorder. $Hyper-IgE syndrome is characterized by impaired JAK-STAT signaling, leading to defective differentiation and function of #T-helper cell type 17# (Th17).  Th17 cells normally produce IL-17, which activates #neutrophils# to #migrate# to the site of infection.  Without this cytokine, neutrophil function is impaired, causing recurrent skin and #sinopulmonary infections# most commonly due to Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans.  Neutrophil-induced inflammation is absent, so #abscesses# are often nontender (ie, #cold#), and patients are typically afebrile with a normal leukocyte count, as opposed to the leukocytosis expected with infection. $In addition to immunodeficiency, #chronic atopic dermatitis# is a prominent feature of hyper-IgE syndrome and typically begins in early infancy.  Colonization of S aureus and C albicans on the skin triggers mast cell histamine release, causing severe pruritus and an eczematous rash.  Patients characteristically have #eosinophilia# and #elevated IgE# related to the dermatitis, but #other immunoglobulin levels# are usually #normal#.  A low Th17 count supports the diagnosis, and molecular genetic testing is confirmatory. $#(Choice A)#  All immunoglobulin levels are decreased/absent in X-linked agammaglobulinemia due to impaired B-cell maturation.  Severe sinopulmonary and invasive bacterial infections begin in infancy, and failure to thrive is typical.  Without immunoglobulin replacement most children will have near fatal infections early in life. $#(Choice B)#  Chronic eczema without an underlying immunodeficiency can cause elevated IgE, and IgG may also be high if the rash is superinfected.  However, the affected area would be erythematous and tender, unlike this patient's cold abscess, making isolated atopic disease unlikely. $#(Choice C)#  Hyper-IgM syndrome, in which immunoglobulin class-switching is impaired due to CD40 ligand deficiency, typically presents in infancy with sinopulmonary and opportunistic infections.  Recurrent cold skin abscesses do not typically occur. $#(Choice E)#  Selective IgA deficiency can cause recurrent sinopulmonary infections and is associated with an increased risk for atopy.  However, skin infections would not be expected. $#Educational objective# Hyper-IgE syndrome is characterized by elevated IgE levels and is caused by impaired neutrophil activation and migration due to a defect in T-helper cell type 17 cells.  Typical findings include noninflammatory (ie, cold) abscesses, recurrent sinopulmonary infections, and chronic atopic dermatitis. "

  "explanation_2": "This patient with #impaired renal function# within the first few weeks following renal transplant likely has #acute rejection#.  This process is mostly #cell-mediated# and results from #sensitization of recipient T cells# to donor graft MHC antigens (human leukocyte antigens).  Humoral (antibody-mediated) immunity may also be involved in acute rejection, but it typically plays a smaller role. $Acute rejection usually occurs within the #first 6 months# following transplantation.  Patients often have an asymptomatic rise in serum creatinine, but they may also have low-grade fever, malaise, joint pains, and graft tenderness.  Histology reveals a #dense lymphocytic infiltrate# sometimes accompanied by vascular inflammation.  Acute rejection is typically reversible and usually treated with high-dose glucocorticoids.  Chronic immunosuppression with a calcineurin inhibitor–based regimen (eg, tacrolimus plus mycophenolate and low-dose prednisone) helps prevent acute rejection episodes. $#(Choices A and B)#  Graft versus host disease (GVHD) primarily involves activation of donor T cells within grafted tissue against recipient (host) antigens.  B cells are also involved to a lesser extent.  GVHD typically occurs only when the recipient lacks a competent immune response (eg, in the setting of bone marrow transplant). $#(Choice C)#  Host B-cell sensitization against donor antigens results in a humoral antibody response and is sometimes involved in acute rejection.  Histology is expected to show deposition of complement (eg, C4d), neutrophilic infiltrate, and necrotizing vasculitis; this patient's mononuclear (lymphocytic) infiltrate is consistent with a cell-mediated T-cell response.  Although it can occur acutely, the humoral response tends to be more involved in chronic rejection, which occurs months to years following transplant. $#(Choice E)#  Preformed antibodies against graft ABO or other antigens can lead to hyperacute graft rejection.  Because the antibodies are already present in the recipient circulation, there is rapid response against the donor graft, leading to arterial fibrinoid necrosis and vascular thrombosis with graft mottling and cyanosis.  Thorough crossmatching prior to transplant makes hyperacute rejection a rare occurrence. $#Educational objective# Organ rejection can be hyperacute, acute, or chronic.  Acute rejection most often occurs within weeks or up to 6 months after transplant and is predominantly cell-mediated, involving sensitization of host T lymphocytes against donor MHC antigens.  There is typically graft dysfunction with histology showing a dense, mononuclear (ie, lymphocytic) infiltrate. "

Binding of IFN-γ to its receptor on a macrophage causes transcription of IFN-γ-regulated genes through activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway.  The result is upregulation of IL-12 production, enhanced mycobacterial intracellular killing in phagolysosomes, and production of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) which promotes formation of granulomas. $Autosomal recessive deficiencies of the IFN-γ receptor (or other elements of this pathway) result in #disseminated mycobacterial disease# (or BCG infection if the vaccine is administered) in infancy or early childhood.

The cutaneous findings are consistent with @a wheal-and-flare reaction@, an erythematous papule or plaque often with central pallor (wheal) and peripheral erythema (flare). $During initial allergen exposure, a patient predisposed to an allergic response will undergo antibody class switching from IgM to #IgE antibodies# specific for the allergen.  IgE produced by B lymphocytes and plasma cells then binds to high-affinity IgE Fc receptors on #basophils# and #mast cells#.  Re-exposure to the allergen results in cross-linking of bound IgE antibodies with subsequent degranulation and release of inflammatory mediators (eg, #histamine#, proteases [tryptase], leukotrienes, prostaglandins).  Localized vasodilation and increased vascular permeability result in the characteristic wheal-and-flare lesions.  In severe cases, widespread release of these agents can also cause systemic vasodilation, bronchoconstriction, and massive fluid shifts, leading to anaphylactic shock and potentially death. $#(Choice A)#  C3b, the larger subunit produced by cleavage of complement component 3, binds to pathogens and enhances phagocytosis.  The C3b component of immune complexes formed by type III hypersensitivity reactions can also bind to CR1 receptors on erythrocytes, facilitating their clearance in the liver and spleen. $#(Choice B)#  IL-2 is a cytokine produced by TH1 lymphocytes that increases proliferation and activity of helper, cytotoxic, and regulatory T cells as well as NK cells.

  "explanation_2": "$#Secretory IgA# is the major antibody associated with #mucosal immunity#.  Upon intestinal exposure to a novel antigen, B cells found in mesenteric lymph nodes and Peyer's patches become activated and preferentially migrate to the lamina propria underlying the intestinal mucosa.  There, they become fully differentiated plasma cells that begin to synthesize IgA dimers (linked by #J chain#).  These IgA dimers then bind to the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) found on the basolateral surface of intestinal epithelial cells and undergo transcytosis.  As the linked IgA dimer is released into the intestinal lumen, a portion of pIgR remains attached to the antibody (#secretory component#), forming the complete secretory IgA molecule. $Stimulation of local secretory IgA production is best promoted when the corresponding mucosal surfaces are #directly stimulated# by the antigen.  In addition, live attenuated vaccines generally produce stronger immune responses than killed vaccines by acting as a persistent stimulus that better activates helper and cytotoxic T cells.  As a result, the #live attenuated oral# (Sabin) poliovirus vaccine generates a much more robust oropharyngeal and intestinal mucosal IgA response than the inactivated poliovirus (Salk) vaccine. $#(Choice A)#  Cerebrospinal fluid IgG antibody levels can increase due to a rise in local production (eg, multiple sclerosis, viral CNS infections) or inflammation of the blood-brain barrier (eg, trauma, meningitis), leading to excessive leakage of plasma proteins. $#(Choices C, D, and E)#  Serum IgA (mainly monomeric), IgG, and IgM increase with both forms of the polio vaccine and are protective against viral dissemination.  Serum IgG and IgM can also be secreted by the mucosa although to a lesser extent than secretory IgA (explaining why most patients with selective IgA deficiency are asymptomatic). $#Educational objective# The live attenuated oral (Sabin) poliovirus vaccine produces a stronger mucosal secretory IgA immune response than does the inactivated poliovirus (Salk) vaccine.  This increase in mucosal IgA offers immune protection at the site of viral entry by inhibiting attachment to intestinal epithelial cells.  "

However, an @absence of HLA-DR+@ cells indicates defective expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules.  The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes encode @MHC molecules@ expressed on the cell surface for @antigen presentation@.  There are 6 major HLA loci: $• HLA-DP, HLA-DQ, and #HLA-DR# genes encode #MHC class II# molecules, which are expressed on #antigen-presenting cells# (eg, B cells, macrophages) after an extracellular antigen has been loaded onto the @MHC class II molecule@ in an acidified #lysosome#. $• HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C genes encode MHC class I molecules, which are expressed on nucleated cells after a cytosolic antigen has been transported into the endoplasmic reticulum and loaded onto the @MHC class I molecule@ #(choice E)#. $Because expression of the MHC class II–peptide complex is necessary for activation of B and T cells, its absence (eg, bare lymphocyte syndrome type II) causes a form of severe combined immunodeficiency. $#(Choice A)#  DiGeorge syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by the deletion of a segment of chromosome 22 (22q11.2).  Failed development of the thymus results in T cell deficiency, which would be evident by a reduction in CD3+ cells on flow cytometry. $#(Choice B)#  CD40 ligand (CD40L) is expressed on activated T helper cells and interacts with CD40 on B cells to promote immunoglobulin class-switching.  Impaired CD40L expression can result in hyperimmunoglobulin M syndrome (ie, high IgM levels and low/absent circulating IgG, IgA, and IgE).  Although this patient's mutation impairs activation of T cells, his CD4+ T cells would still be capable of expressing CD40L upon activation. $#(Choice C)#  Maturation of pro-B cells into pre-B cells with resulting expression of B cell–specific surface markers (eg, CD19, CD40) is dependent on signal transduction by Bruton tyrosine kinases.  A mutation in the BTK gene causes X-linked agammaglobulinemia, which is characterized by hypogammaglobulinemia and recurrent infections after maternal IgG is depleted (~3 months of age).  Flow cytometry would show a marked decrease in CD19+ cells. $#Educational objective# Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules are encoded by the HLA-DP, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DR genes and present extracellular antigens processed in acidified lysosomes by antigen-presenting cells (eg, B cells, macrophages).

  "explanation_2": "This kidney transplant recipient with #progressive decline in renal function# most likely has #chronic allograft rejection#.  The process is a #mixed cell-mediated and antibody-mediated# response and can occur anytime from #several months to years# posttransplantation. $Following transplant, T cells are activated and recipient antibodies are created against graft HLA and other antigens.  The activated T cells can initially cause cell-mediated acute rejection, which is generally reversible via an increase in immunosuppression (eg, high-dose glucocorticoids).  Chronic rejection represents progression of cell-mediated and antibody-mediated inflammation (eg, via activation of complement and recruitment of neutrophils) to the point that #irreversible# renal damage takes place; the kidney grossly decreases in size, and histopathology shows #obliterative vascular wall thickening# with #tubular atrophy# and #interstitial fibrosis#. $Due to increased sodium retention, declining renal function in chronic rejection is also commonly accompanied by new or worsening #hypertension#.  Chronic rejection is the most common cause of renal graft failure following transplant. $#(Choice A)#  A dense, interstitial, mononuclear (lymphocytic) infiltrate is characteristic of acute allograft rejection, which is most often a primarily T cell–mediated process.  Acute rejection typically occurs <6 months after transplant but can occur later in a patient in whom posttransplant immunosuppression has been stopped. $#(Choice B)#  Glomerular injury in chronic rejection is predominantly ischemic, and crescent formation is not typically observed.  Crescents develop mainly in anti–glomerular basement membrane antibody–mediated, antineutrophilic cytoplasmic autoantibody–associated, or immune complex–mediated glomerulonephritis. $#(Choice D)#  Muddy brown casts can be seen with acute tubular necrosis, which usually manifests as acute (rather than gradual) kidney injury.  Tubular hypertrophy may be present during the recovery phase.  These findings are not typical of chronic rejection. $#(Choice E)#  Vascular fibrinoid necrosis with capillary thrombotic occlusion occurs in hyperacute rejection, which is a rapid and profound form of antibody-mediated rejection caused by preformed antibodies to graft antigens.  Chronic rejection is a more gradual antibody-mediated process resulting from sensitization that occurs after a transplant has taken place. $#Educational objective# Chronic renal allograft rejection manifests months to years after a transplant and presents with worsening hypertension and a gradual decline in renal function.

  "explanation_2": "$T-lymphocytes, or thymocytes, are initially produced in the bone marrow, but they migrate from that location to mature during the first trimester of gestation in the thymus.  In the thymus, the processes of T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement, positive selection, negative selection, and expression of extracellular membrane markers and co-stimulatory molecules occurs.  Pro-T cells arrive at the thymus as \"double negative\" cells – indicating that they lack both CD4 and CD8 antigens and begin their differentiation in the subcapsular zone.  Next, the process of TCR beta gene rearrangement occurs with simultaneous expression of both CD4 and CD8.  Once in thymic cortex, the alpha genes rearrange to produce a functional alpha-beta TCR.  Subsequently, the processes of positive and negative selection occur with cells that fail either of these tests being eliminated by apoptosis. $Positive selection is the process by which only T cells expressing a TCR that is able to bind self MHC are allowed to survive.  Those cells expressing a TCR that is not specific for self MHC are signaled for elimination by apoptosis.  This process occurs after TCR DNA rearrangement and prior to the process of negative selection.  It occurs in the thymic cortex and involves interaction of T cells with #thymic cortical epithelial cells# expressing self MHC #(choice D)#.  Positive selection is responsible for development of a T cell repertoire that can recognize self. $Negative selection occurs after positive selection and is the process by which T cells possessing TCRs that bind with high affinity to self antigen or self MHC class I or II are eliminated by apoptosis.  Negative selection occurs in the thymic medulla and involves interaction of the developing T cells with #thymic medullary epithelial and dendritic cells#.  This process serves to eliminate T cells that may be overly autoreactive against self antigens and therefore may play a role in autoimmunity if not destroyed.  This results in a population of T cells that have only an appropriately low affinity for self MHC molecules. $#(Choice A)#  Affinity maturation is the process of enhancing the hypervariable region antigen binding affinity that occurs after initial binding of antigen to membrane-bound immunoglobulin on a naïve B lymphocyte and subsequent migration of that B-lymphocyte to a lymph node.  Within the germinal center of the lymph node, affinity maturation is accomplished by the process of somatic hypermutation where the DNA coding for the immunoglobulin variable region is mutated randomly at a very high rate.  This process results in new immunoglobulins with similar, better, or worse affinity for the antigen; only B cells expressing antibody with enhanced affinity for antigen will be selected for.  This process does not occur in T-lymphocyte maturation. $#(Choice B)#  Isotype switching is a process that occurs in naïve B-lymphocytes upon initial exposure to antigen; this process does not occur in T-lymphocyte maturation. $#(Choice E)#  TCR DNA rearrangement is an exceedingly complex process that results in excess of 1015 different possible antigen binding sites.  The process is similar to that of immunoglobulin gene rearrangement in that it involves joining of V, D, J and C regions of the TCR gene and the processes of junctional flexibility, N and P-region nucleotide addition, alternative joining of genes, and multiple peptides combining to form the intact receptor.  The mature TCR is formed from joining of an a and a b protein segment, and these proteins are membrane-bound in close association with either CD4 or CD8 as well as the costimulatory CD28 and CD45. $#Educational objective# The process of negative selection in T cell maturation is essential for eliminating T cells that bind to self MHC or self antigens with overly high affinity.  This process occurs in the thymic medulla.  If these cells were permitted to survive, they would likely induce immune and inflammatory reactions against self antigens leading to autoimmune disease.

These processes act to increase the proportion of virally infected cells that undergo apoptosis. $#(Choices C and D)#  Interferon γ is a type II interferon produced mainly by T cells and NK cells.  It promotes TH1 differentiation, increases expression of class II MHC molecules on antigen-presenting cells, and improves the intracellular killing ability of macrophages.  However, virally infected respiratory epithelial cells would secrete interferons α and β, not interferon γ. $#(Choice E)#  Neutrophils primarily phagocytize and destroy bacterial and fungal pathogens.

Attacks are often precipitated by minor trauma (eg, dental procedure) or emotional stress and are #not associated# with itching or urticaria. $Initial evaluation of hereditary angioedema is with @complement@ testing.  #Low C4# is characteristic because, in the absence of C1 inhibitor, unregulated activation of C1 leads to #excess activated C1# and, in turn, unchecked cleavage of C4.  Diagnosis is confirmed by a decrease in functional C1 inhibitor level. $#(Choices A and E)#  Elevated eosinophils and IgE are associated with allergic conditions.  In contrast to bradykinin-mediated hereditary angioedema, allergic angioedema (eg, anaphylaxis) is due to histamine release from activated mast cells and presents with pruritis and urticaria in addition to swelling. $#(Choice C)#  C8 is involved in the formation of the membrane attack complex, which, when deficient, results in increased susceptibility to Neisseria infections.  Deficiency of terminal complement components (C5, C6, C7, C8, C9) does not occur with hereditary angioedema because the upstream complement fragments (C2b, C4b) are rapidly inactivated in the plasma. $#(Choice D)#  Selective IgA deficiency increases risk for anaphylaxis, which can cause angioedema.  However, this risk is only with transfusion of blood products and would present with other organ system involvement (eg, bronchospasm, hypotension, urticaria).  IgA deficiency is also associated with certain autoimmune conditions (eg, celiac disease, systemic lupus erythematosus), but none of these would present with isolated facial swelling. $#Educational objective# Hereditary angioedema is characterized by recurrent episodes of cutaneous and/or mucosal swelling due to C1 inhibitor deficiency.  C4 levels are low due to uninhibited cleavage of C4 by excess activated C1.  ",

Pieces of these proteins (#neoantigens#) are displayed on the cell surface and may be recognized by cytotoxic T-cells as \"non-self\" (leading to cellular apoptosis).  However, neoplastic cells can blunt the cytotoxic T-cell response through a variety of mechanisms including the overexpression of #programmed death-ligand 1# (PD-L1), which binds to the PD-1 receptor on cytotoxic T cells and inhibits their ability to induce apoptosis (T-cell exhaustion). $Treatment with #monoclonal antibodies# against PD-1 (eg, pembrolizumab, nivolumab) or PD-L1 (eg, atezolizumab) results in T-cell disinhibition and a restoration of the cytotoxic response (thereby increasing cancer cell apoptosis).  Anti-PD-1 therapy is currently used in advanced melanoma, certain types of lung cancer, and renal cell carcinoma but is being explored for many other cancer types. $#(Choices A and B)#  HIV uses chemokine coreceptor 5 (CCR5) to @bind@ to CD4 cells.  Antagonists to CCR5 have been developed for the management of patients with HIV.  CCR5 also appears to promote CD4 cell anti-tumor responses, so antibodies blocking its function may downregulate immune-mediated tumor destruction.  Blockade of CD4 itself would inhibit helper T-cell activation and reduce tumor cell destruction. $#(Choice C)#  CD19 is expressed primarily on B cells (not T cells) and is important for B-cell signaling and activation. $#(Choice D)#  @CD28@ is a T cell–specific surface protein that interacts with B7 on antigen-presenting cells, providing a costimulatory signal necessary for T-cell activation.  Therefore, antibodies blocking CD28 would inhibit T-cell activation.  CTLA-4 also binds to B7 but has an inhibitory function on activated T cells. $#Educational objective# The binding of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) to one of its ligands (programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1]) downregulates the immune response by inhibiting cytotoxic T cells.  Many types of cancers evade immunodetection by increasing expression of PD-L1 on their surface.  Monoclonal antibodies against PD-1 upregulate the T-cell response and promote tumor cell apoptosis.

Because syncope-related falls can lead to serious injury (eg, skull fractures, intracranial hemorrhage), patients should be closely monitored for 15 minutes following vaccine administration. $Patients with vasovagal syncope typically experience a #prodrome# (eg, pallor, nausea, diaphoresis) prior to losing consciousness.  The mechanism is not well understood, but the trigger, in combination with a state of orthostatic stress (eg, upright posture, dehydration), is believed to signal the CNS to decrease sympathetic activity and increase parasympathetic tone, overriding the @normal baroreceptor response@.  This leads to #bradycardia#, reduced LV contractility, and decreased peripheral vascular resistance, resulting in #hypotension#, decreased cerebral perfusion, and, ultimately, syncope.  Symptoms rapidly resolve within 1-2 minutes. $Postvaccination syncope can be confused with anaphylaxis, a rare but serious adverse effect resulting from IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to a vaccine component (eg, egg or yeast proteins).  Anaphylaxis can develop rapidly following vaccination and may cause hypotension and syncope; however, affected patients typically experience urticaria or flushing rather than pallor, respiratory symptoms (eg, upper airway edema, bronchospasm), and reflex tachycardia rather than bradycardia #(choice C)#. $#(Choice A)#  Delayed-type reactions are due to the direct action of sensitized T cells when stimulated by contact with an antigen.  They occur hours to days, rather than minutes, after exposure and typically present with a rash. $#(Choice B)#  An excessive cytokine response to the microbial components of a vaccine can result in a self-limiting local reaction (eg, redness or pain at the vaccination site) or, sometimes, systemic symptoms (eg, fever, malaise). $#(Choice E)#  The administration of a @live attenuated vaccine@ (eg, measles, mumps, and rubella) to an immunocompromised host may cause uncontrolled replication and systemic invasion of the virus.

Light chains have a variable and constant region; heavy chains have a variable region and 3 or 4 constant regions (CH1-4) depending on the immunoglobulin type. $Immunoglobulins are generally further divided into 2 functional pieces as follows: $• The #Fab fragment# is composed of the entire light-chain and the heavy-chain variable and first constant region.  This portion of the immunoglobulin uses the variable region of the light and heavy chain to #bind specific antigenic epitopes#.  IgM has 10 Fab fragments; other immunoglobulins have 2 $• The #Fc fragment# is composed of the remaining constant regions (eg, CH2-4) of the heavy chain.  The Fc fragment exerts the effector functions of the molecule, which may include activating the classical complement cascade (eg, CH2 on IgG) or binding the Fc receptor on phagocytic cells (eg, CH4 on IgM, CH3 on IgG) $IgG, IgA, and IgD also have a #hinge region# between the Fab and the Fc fragments.  The hinge region is rich in cysteine and proline amino acids, which provide #significant flexibility# to the immunoglobulin and allow greater movement of the Fab fragment arms.

IgE interacts with the Fc epsilon receptor on mast cells, IgG interacts with the Fc gamma receptor on phagocytes and natural killer cells, and IgA interacts with the Fc alpha receptor on neutrophils, macrophages, and eosinophils.  The specificity of these interactions is mediated by the heavy-chain constant regions in the Fc portion of the immunoglobulins, not the hinge region. $#Educational objective# IgG, IgA, and IgD have a hinge region between the Fab fragment and the Fc fragment of the immunoglobulin.  The hinge region increases flexibility of the Fab arms, which makes the antibody more likely to bind to more than one site on the antigen.

  "explanation_2": "This boy's rapidly progressive illness with high fever and petechial rash raises strong suspicion for #Neisseria meningitidis# infection.  The virulence of N meningitidis is due to the presence of a #polysaccharide capsule#, which allows the organism to evade phagocytosis and immunoglobulin attachment.  Because of these adaptations, initial control of infection is primarily mediated by activation of the @alternative complement cascade@, which is triggered when autoactivated C3 interacts with the surface of the bacteria and amplifies. $Activation of the alternative pathway results in generation of the following: $• C3b:  a powerful opsonin that binds to complement receptor 1 on erythrocytes and phagocytes, which increases phagocytosis by reticuloendothelial monocytes $• C3a and C5a:  potent anaphylatoxins that recruit immune cells and drive a strong inflammatory response $• #Membrane attack complexes# (MACs):  composed of the terminal complement proteins (C5-9), MACs generate a channel in the bacterial surface, leading to osmotic lysis of the organism $MACs are the #most important initial defense# against encapsulated bacteria because they operate at high efficiency despite the presence of a capsule.  Therefore, patients with #deficits# in any of the terminal complement proteins that generate the MAC are at very high risk for #recurrent encapsulated bacterial infections# (as seen in this patient).  Laboratory evaluation of these patients will show #reduced activity# of the classical #(CH50)# and alternative #(AH50)# complement cascades because all 3 complement pathways (classical, alternative, lectin) terminate in the generation of MACs. $#(Choices B and C)#  Deficiency in complement proteins unique to the classical cascade (eg, C1q/r/s, C2, C4) will result in low CH50 and normal AH50 levels.  In contrast, deficiency in complement proteins unique to the alternative cascade (eg, factor B, factor D) will result in normal CH50 and low AH50 levels.  This patient's recurrent N meningitidis infections are more characteristic of a terminal complement component deficiency. $#(Choice D)#  Patients with a defect in the lectin complement pathway (eg, mannose-binding lectin) will have normal CH50 and AH50 levels.  Additional evaluation with the mannose-binding lectin test can usually reveal the presence of this abnormality. $#Educational objective# Initial control of encapsulated bacteria is largely reliant on the formation of membrane attack complexes (MACs) due to activation of the alternative complement cascade.  Patients with deficiency in the proteins that generate MACs (C5-9) are at high risk for recurrent encapsulated bacterial infection; evaluation will show reduced activity of the classical (CH50) and alternative (AH50) complement cascades.

The light chain contains a variable region and a constant region; the heavy chain contains a variable region and 3 or 4 constant regions (CH1-4).  The functional structure of the immunoglobulin is broadly divided into the 2 following components: $• The #Fab fragment# is the entire light chain plus the variable and first constant (CH1) regions of the heavy chain; Fab fragments bind to specific #epitopes on antigens# using a hypervariable cluster of 110-130 amino acids in the variable portion of the molecule #(choices D and E)#. $• The #Fc fragment# is the remaining constant regions of the heavy chain; the Fc fragment is the #effector portion# of the immunoglobulin that #interacts with complement and immune cells#. $IgG, the most prevalent immunoglobulin in serum, is the immunoglobulin primarily responsible for controlling most #recurrent bacterial infections#.  It binds to bacterial epitopes with the Fab fragment and then exerts its bactericidal effects with the second and third #heavy chain constant regions# of the Fc fragment, as follows: $• #Complement activation:#  The second heavy-chain constant region serves as a platform for activation of the classical complement cascade.  This generates membrane attack complexes and @opsonizing C3b ligands@ for the CR1 receptor on erythrocytes and reticuloendothelial phagocytes. $• #Direct phagocytosis:#  The third heavy-chain constant region is the ligand for the #Fc receptor# (CD16) on the surface of #phagocytic cells#.  Binding results in phagocytosis of the immunoglobulin-covered bacteria and subsequent destruction. $#(Choice B)#  The constant region of the light chain is bound to the first constant region of the heavy chain with disulfide bonds.  It does not play a significant role in opsonization or phagocyte binding. $#(Choice C)#  Immunoglobulins have hinge regions between the Fab and Fc fragments that provide flexibility to the Fab arms.  Longer hinge regions are associated with increased antibody avidity because the Fab fragments can reach antigens that are farther apart on the bacteria.  The hinge region does not bind to the Fc receptor on phagocytes. $#Educational objective# Immunoglobulin contains a Fab fragment that binds to antigen and an Fc fragment that activates complement and/or interacts with immune cells.  The Fc fragment of IgG activates the classical complement cascade (constant heavy chain region 2) and serves as a ligand for the Fc receptor on phagocytes (constant heavy chain region 3).",

In the thymus the processes of T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement, positive selection, negative selection and expression of extracellular membrane markers and co-stimulatory molecules occur.  Pro-T cells arrive at the thymus as \"double negative\" cells - cells that lack both CD4 and CD8 antigens.  Next, the process of TCR gene rearrangement begins first with rearrangement of the b chain genes.  Synthesis of a productive rearrangement of the b chain of the TCR leads to stimulation of production of BOTH CD4 and CD8 antigens with simultaneous expression of BOTH CD4 and CD8.  These cells are referred to as \"double positive\" T cells or immature T-lymphocytes #(choice A)#.  Subsequently, the process of rearrangement of the a chain of the TCR occurs followed by positive selection in the thymic cortex and negative selection in the thymic medulla.  Once these processes are complete, the final step in maturation of the T-lymphocytes is loss of either the CD4 or the CD8 antigen so that the mature thymocytes only express one or the other of these antigens. $#(Choice B)#  Mature cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are also referred to as CD8+ T-lymphocytes; these cells do not express the CD4 antigen on their surfaces.  These cells recognize and kill altered self cells by recognizing foreign antigen presented by these cells on MHC Class I molecules on the cell surface. $#(Choice C)#  Mature helper T lymphocytes are also referred to as CD4+ T-lymphocytes; these cells do not express the CD8 antigen on their surfaces. $#(Choice D)#  Antigen presenting cells include dendritic cells, macrophages and B-lymphocytes.  Dendritic cells are professional antigen presenting cells.  They take up antigen by endocytosis, constitutively express MHC Class II and the co-stimulatory B7 molecule, and are able to activate all forms of T cells (naïve, effector and memory).  Macrophages are phagocytes that only inducably express MHC II and B7 and can only activate effector and memory T cells, not naive T cells.  B-lymphocytes take up antigen by receptor-mediated (membrane-bound antibody) endocytosis and constitutively express MHC II.  These cells are able to stimulate all forms of T-lymphocytes. $#(Choice E)#  Natural killer (NK) cells are part of the innate immune system and function in a fashion very similar to CD8+ CTLs though they express neither CD8 nor CD4 on their cell surfaces. $#(Choice F)#  Thymic epithelial cells play a role in positive selection of immature thymocytes in the thymic cortex.  These cells express MHC antigens on their cell surfaces that interact with the TCR on the immature thymocytes.  Thymocytes able to bind MHC receive a protective signal and do not undergo apoptosis, while thymocytes unable to bind MHC will be killed.  This is how self-MHC restriction is generated in the T-lymphocyte population. $#Educational objective# Immature T-lymphocytes express both the CD4 and CD8 cell surface antigens in addition to a complete TCR or a pro-TCR.  These lymphocytes exist in the thymic cortex where they undergo positive selection and in the thymic medulla where they undergo negative selection."

  "explanation_2": "#Haemophilus influenzae serotype b (Hib)#, an encapsulated gram-negative coccobacillus, was previously a common, invasive, and potentially fatal cause of pneumonia, epiglottitis, and meningitis in children.  Neonates are protected with maternal anti-Hib IgG antibodies from placental transfer in utero, but this protection wanes as the immunoglobulins are degraded during the first few months of life.  Therefore, widespread vaccination with the Hib @polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccine@ series is recommended starting at age 2 months; this practice has dramatically reduced the incidence of Hib infection. $Bacteria with polysaccharide capsules (eg, Hib, Streptococcus pneumoniae [pneumococcus], Neisseria meningitidis) are antiphagocytic.  The #polysaccharide capsule# provokes an #antibody-mediated (B cell) immune response# and is the primary antigenic constituent of vaccines against encapsulated bacteria.  However, vaccines containing the polysaccharide antigen alone are ineffective in children age <2 years due to their immature humoral immunity.  Therefore, the polysaccharide is #conjugated# with a #carrier protein# to amplify the patient's humoral response against the polysaccharide through T cell recruitment.  The Hib conjugate vaccine contains a carrier protein that is derived from either a tetanus toxoid (TT) protein or an outer membrane protein (OMP) of Neisseria meningitidis.  The polysaccharide-protein conjugate then becomes a T cell-dependent antigen.  #Immunogenicity is increased# as a result of #T cell-dependent stimulation of B lymphocytes# and the #production of memory B lymphocytes#. $#(Choice A)#  Conjugation does not affect vaccine safety.  The main adverse effects of the Hib vaccine include fever, irritability, and injection site reactions (eg, pain, redness, swelling). $#(Choice C)#  Although conjugation allows for a more robust immune response, a 2- or 3-dose primary series in infancy followed by a booster dose is still required to achieve protective Hib antibody levels. $#(Choice D)#  Nontypeable H influenzae represents nonencapsulated strains that generally cause local disease (eg, sinusitis, otitis media).  These bacteria colonize the nasopharynx of most individuals age >5 years.  The Hib vaccine does not confer protection against nontypeable H influenzae. $#(Choice E)#  Conjugated OMP and TT protein do not elicit protective antibody levels.  Therefore, a patient is not considered to be immunized against the pathogen that the carrier protein is derived from. $#Educational objective# The Haemophilus influenzae serotype b vaccine consists of a capsular polysaccharide conjugated to a carrier protein (tetanus toxoid [TT] protein or outer membrane protein [OMP] of Neisseria meningitidis).  Protein conjugation causes a T cell-mediated immune response leading to long-term immunity through production of memory B-lymphocytes.  ",

  "explanation_2": "$Apoptosis can be triggered by a number of mechanisms, including deprivation of growth factors, DNA damage, intracellular accumulation of misfolded proteins, mediation by cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and activation of receptors in the TNF receptor family (such as Fas).  Fas receptors initiate the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis through a cytoplasmic component known as the death domain.  Upon binding Fas ligand (FasL), the receptors trimerize, allowing their death domains to form a binding site for an adapter protein called Fas-associated death domain (FADD).  Receptor-bound FADD then stimulates the activation of initiator caspases (8 & 10) that begin an activation cascade culminating in the activation of executioner caspases (3 & 6).  These initiate the terminal processes of apoptosis, including cleavage of DNA, fragmentation of the nucleus, organelle autodigestion, and plasma membrane blebbing. $The Fas receptor is expressed on T-lymphocytes and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases, including cancer and autoimmune disorders.  Once activated, T lymphocytes begin to express FasL, which can bind to Fas on the same cell or adjacent lymphocytes.  During initial clonal expansion, activated T lymphocytes are resistant to Fas-induced apoptosis.  However, they become more sensitive with progressive stimulation.  In the constant presence of stimulating self-antigens, activated T lymphocytes eventually undergo apoptosis in a process known as activation-induced cell death.  Mutations involving Fas or FasL impair this process, resulting in excessive accumulation of autoreactive T-cells and the development of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (which this patient appears to have). $#(Choice B)#  As B lymphocytes undergo affinity maturation, cells that exhibit a stronger affinity for the antigen (which acts as a limited growth resource) are able to proliferate more than cells with lower affinity.  This results in cells that are more efficient and accurate in binding to pathogens.  Affinity maturation does not involve the Fas pathway. $#(Choice C)#  Anergy is a state of prolonged unresponsiveness that occurs in T lymphocytes as a form of immune tolerance.  It occurs when self-reactive T cells bind MHC molecules without receiving the necessary costimulatory signal (ie, binding of CD28 on T cells with the B7 on antigen-presenting cells). $#(Choice D)#  Isotype switching is the process through which activated B lymphocytes switch production from IgM immunoglobulins to IgG and IgA isotypes.  This process requires the interaction of CD40 on activated B cells with CD40 ligand expressed by activated T cells and is modulated by cytokines secreted by T cells. $#(Choice E)#  On exposure to an antigen, naïve T helper (TH0) cells differentiate into TH1 (cell-mediating) and TH2 (antibody-mediating) subtypes based on the local cytokine milieu.  IFN-γ and IL-12 induce TH1 formation; IL-4 stimulates TH2 development. $#Educational objective# The Fas receptor acts to initiate the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis.  Mutations involving the Fas receptor or Fas ligand can prevent apoptosis of autoreactive lymphocytes, thereby increasing the risk of autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus.  "

These proteins are processed by antigen presenting cells, displayed on class II major histocompatibility complexes, and the nonhuman components are #recognized as foreign# by patrolling CD4 cells.  The CD4 cells then stimulate activated B-cells to undergo somatic hypermutation and class switching, which generates plasma cells that secrete high-affinity #IgG antibodies against foreign components# of the drug. $With subsequent infusions, the foreign proteins in the medication trigger memory B cells to differentiate into plasma cells, which generate a burst of IgG against the monoclonal antibody.  Binding of the IgG to the medication generates #immune complexes# (ICs), which are then #cleared by mononuclear phagocytes# in the reticuloendothelial system, as follows: $• #Classic complement activation:#  The Fc portion of the bound IgG activates the @classical complement system@, leading to the generation of C3b on the IC.  C3b binds to CR1 on erythrocytes/leukocytes, which bring the IC to reticuloendothelial mononuclear phagocytes (eg, Kupffer cells, splenic macrophages) for clearance. $• #Direct removal:#  Mononuclear phagocytes bind to the Fc portion of the bound IgG using their Fc receptor (CD16) and remove the IC from the circulation. $IC clearance generally proceeds without issue, but significant quantities of ICs can saturate the phagocytic system and lead to IC aggregation; IC aggregates can deposit in tissue (eg, skin, joints), where persistent complement activation can result in a @type III hypersensitivity@ reaction called #serum sickness#.  This is typically marked by fever, urticarial rash, and joint pain #5-14 days# after exposure.  Most cases #resolve spontaneously# over days as mononuclear phagocytes continue to remove the excess ICs. $#(Choice B)#  Glucocorticoids trigger apoptotic cell death of eosinophils and tissue mast cells in patients with allergic conditions (eg, asthma).  Apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death, is not typically associated with degranulation or allergic symptoms. $#(Choices C and D)#  Antibodies are too large to be cleared from the bloodstream through fenestrations in the liver or kidney.  Instead, they are typically removed via endocytosis or phagocytosis after binding Fc receptors on the surface of immune cells (eg, macrophages, eosinophils, mast cells).  Endocytosis and degradation of mast cell-bound IgE occurs with type I hypersensitivity reactions (which occur within minutes, not days later); in addition, this process is only responsible for removing tiny amounts of IgE (not ICs) from the body. $#(Choice E)#  Regulatory T cells downregulate the cytotoxic T-cell response.  Although cytotoxic T cells mediate Stevens-Johnson syndrome (destruction of keratinocytes that are displaying drug antigens), they do not play a role in the development of serum sickness. $#Educational objective# Serum sickness is an immune complex–mediated type III hypersensitivity reaction that typically forms 5-14 days after exposure to foreign proteins in an antitoxin, antivenom, monoclonal antibody, or vaccine.  Patients typically develop fever, urticarial rash, and arthralgia that resolve spontaneously over days as the immune complexes are cleared by the mononuclear phagocyte system.  ",

The presence of a large number of intact bacteria inside the neutrophils suggests #chronic granulomatous disease# (CGD), an X-linked recessive immunodeficiency marked by #impaired NADPH oxidase# activity. $NADPH oxidase resides on the plasma membrane of neutrophils and is incorporated into the membrane of the phagolysosome during phagocytosis; it catalyzes the formation of #superoxide free radicals#, which subsequently destroy engulfed pathogens (eg, fungi, bacteria) as part of the @oxidative burst@.  Because patients with CGD have impaired NADPH oxidase activity, they are not able to efficiently destroy bacteria and fungi following @phagocytosis@; therefore, microscopy will often reveal #intact microbes# in the neutrophil phagolysosome during active infection. $Patients with CGD are most susceptible to #catalase-positive organisms#, particularly Staphylococcus aureus, Burkholderia, Serratia, Nocardia, and Aspergillus.  Catalase degrades hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen, which reduces oxidative damage and protease activation by reactive oxygen species.  Although most pathogenic bacteria and fungi produce catalase, catalase-positive organisms pose a particular risk to patients with CGD because they require higher levels of free radicals (ie, greater NADPH oxidase function) for effective killing. $#(Choice B)#  S aureus produces coagulase, which binds to prothrombin and increases conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin.

He also has a history of recurrent infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus, another #catalase-positive organism#, as well as #normal immunoglobulin levels# and an appropriately elevated leukocyte count in response to infection (ie, #no leukopenia#).  These findings are suggestive of #chronic granulomatous disease# (CGD). $CGD is most commonly due to an X-linked recessive mutation affecting @NADPH oxidase@.  This enzyme is the first step in the respiratory burst pathway, initiating the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS).  In addition to directly damaging phagocytized pathogens, ROS also activate granule proteases that aid in the @destruction of organisms@ within the phagolysosome. $Without NADPH oxidase, patients with CGD have #impaired respiratory burst#.  Although protease degranulation occurs normally #(Choice A)#, these enzymes are not activated due to the absence of ROS, resulting in #defective phagocytic intracellular killing#.  Catalase-positive bacteria and fungi are most pathogenic in CGD because they can degrade their own metabolically produced hydrogen peroxide (ie, ROS), further limiting microbicidal protease activation.  Patients commonly develop S aureus abscesses (eg, lymphadenitis) and severe lung infections, as seen in this patient. $#(Choices B and E)#  Disrupted phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils refers to the impaired engulfing of organisms, which can occur when opsonization is absent due to antibody or complement deficiency.  In contrast, this patient's serum immunoglobulin levels are normal. $#(Choice C)#  Dysfunctional neutrophil trafficking is seen in leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) and causes impaired @leukocyte migration@.  Patients have recurrent mucosal infections and skin abscesses without pus, often due to S aureus, but recurrent lymphadenitis and Aspergillus infection would not be expected.  Moreover, marked leukocytosis (often >50,000/mm3) is typical with LAD because leukocytes cannot migrate out of blood vessels. $#Educational objective# Chronic granulomatous disease should be suspected in a child with recurrent infections by catalase-positive organisms (eg, Staphylococcus aureus, Aspergillus) who has normal immunoglobulins and no leukopenia.  Pathogenesis involves the defective intracellular killing of phagocytized organisms within neutrophils due to an impaired respiratory burst.",

  "explanation_2": "$Interactions between multiple receptors and ligands are generally required to activate effector cells of the adaptive immune response.  This redundancy slows immune cell activation and prevents development of autoimmunity.  #CD40 ligand# (CD40L), a transmembrane protein on the surface of #activated CD4 T cells#, is the most important #costimulatory# signal for #antigen-presenting cells# (APCs) as follows: $• #B Cells#:  Binding of CD40L to CD40 on B cells promotes the formation of germinal centers, somatic hypermutation (increased antigen-binding specificity), and @immunoglobulin class switching@ (secretion of IgG/IgA/IgE instead of IgM).  These actions significantly enhance the humoral immune response by generating the full range of effector immunoglobulins. $• #Macrophages# and #dendritic cells#:  Binding of CD40L to CD40 causes the APC to produce proinflammatory cytokines, express T-cell costimulatory signals (eg, CD80/86), increase phagocytosis, and increase major histocompatibility complex class II surface expression.  These changes promote the activation of additional CD4 T lymphocytes, which are critical for mounting a potent cell-mediated immune response. $Because CD40L is required for B-cells to undergo class-switching, mutations to CD40L generally cause B cells to overproduce IgM and dramatically underproduce other immunoglobulin classes (IgA, IgE, IgG).  Patients with this disorder #(hyper-IgM syndrome)# generally have significant deficits in both cell-mediated (eg, prevention of Pneumocystis pneumonia) and humoral (eg, opsonization and destruction of encapsulated bacteria) immunity. $#(Choice A)#  Certain complement components can reduce the amount of antigen necessary for B-cell activation by binding CD19 or CD21 on the B-cell surface.  This contributes to T-cell–independent B-cell activation and does not involve CD40L. $#(Choice B)#  Antigen-specific B-cell receptors bind to foreign antigens, the first step in B-cell activation.  CD40L plays a role in costimulation of the B cell by binding to CD40; it does not significantly alter B-cell antigen-receptor binding. $#(Choice C)#  CD18 on neutrophils binds to intercellular adhesion molecule-1 on vascular endothelial cells, allowing the neutrophils to migrate into tissue from the bloodstream.  Leukocyte adhesion deficits are usually triggered by mutations to CD18 and marked by recurrent infection.  They do not involve CD40L. $#(Choice D)#  The Fc receptor (CD16) on phagocytes binds to IgG attached to microorganisms or cellular debris, leading to opsonophagocytosis.  Although IgG levels are very low in hyper-IgM syndrome, which significantly reduces IgG-mediated phagocytosis, the interaction between the phagocyte Fc receptor and antigen-bound antibody remains unaffected. $#Educational objective# CD40-ligand (CD40L) is expressed primarily on activated T cells.  It binds to CD40 on antigen-presenting cells, including B cells, leading to their full activation (costimulation).  Therefore, CD40L plays a vital role in both the cell-mediated and humoral immune response.  ",

The following steps are involved in @inflammatory leukocyte accumulation@: $ 1. Margination:  Increased vascular leakage in the microvasculature leads to hemoconcentration and decreased wall shear stress, improving the contact of neutrophils with the endothelial lining #(choice B)#.  $2. Rolling:  Neutrophils roll on the endothelium via the loose binding of sialylated carbohydrate groups, such as Sialyl Lewis X or PSGL-1, to #L-selectin# on neutrophils or #E-selectin/P-selectin# on endothelial cells #(choice C)#.  Cytokine stimulation greatly increases expression of endothelial selectins.  $3. Activation:  Slow rolling allows the leukocytes to sample the chemokines secreted by the inflamed tissue.  This activates integrins by inducing a signaling cascade that results in a conformational change in the integrins necessary for binding.  $4. Tight adhesion and crawling:  Neutrophils become firmly attached to the endothelium via the binding of #CD 18 beta 2 integrins# (#Mac-1# and #LFA-1#) to #intercellular adhesion molecule-1# (#ICAM-1#) on endothelial cells (#choices A and D)#.  $5. Transmigration:  After crawling to the endothelial cell periphery, neutrophils eventually migrate out of the vasculature by squeezing in between the cells via integrin attachments and adherence to #platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1# (#PECAM-1#).  This protein is found primarily at the peripheral intercellular junctions of endothelial cells. $Three leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) syndromes have been identified whereby leukocytes cannot leave the vasculature to migrate into tissues under conditions of inflammation.  All are rare, autosomal recessive disorders. $LAD type 1 results from the absence of CD18.  This leads to the inability to synthesize the beta-2 integrins Mac-1 and LFA1, affecting tight adhesion, crawling, and transmigration.  The clinical manifestations include recurrent skin infections #without pus formation#, #delayed detachment of the umbilical cord#, and poor wound healing.  LAD type 2 is a milder condition, with no delay in the separation of the umbilical cord and less severe and fewer infections.  LAD type 3 is similar to type 1 and causes severe, recurrent bacterial infections, delayed separation of the umbilical cord, and bleeding complications (due to affected beta-3 integrins on platelets). $#Educational objective# Inflammation is characterized by the passage of circulating inflammatory leukocytes into the inflamed tissue.

However, the presence of microbes or damaged cells amplifies the production of C3b, which then engages with #factor B# and factor D and generates C3 convertase. $C3 convertase catalyzes the formation of proteins that opsonize pathogens, promote inflammation, and lead to the generation of membrane attack complexes. $The most common cause of complement deficiency is #autoantibodies#, which activate the classical complement system after binding host antigens.

  "explanation_2": "$Unless a transplanted kidney is obtained from a genetically identical donor (eg, identical twin), chronic #immunosuppression therapy# is needed to help prevent organ rejection.  #Sirolimus# is commonly used as part of the immunosuppression regimen for solid organ transplants.  It functions as a proliferation signal inhibitor by targeting the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling pathway, an important stimulator of cell growth and proliferation.  Specifically, sirolimus binds to the immunophilin FK binding protein (FKBP), forming a complex that #inhibits mTOR#.  This leads to #interruption of IL-2 signal transduction#, preventing G1 to S phase progression and lymphocyte proliferation. $Calcineurin inhibitors (eg, tacrolimus, cyclosporine) are other commonly used immunosuppression medications that function by blocking the translocation of nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), resulting in reduced transcription of IL-2. $#(Choice A)#  Bortezomib binds and inhibits the 26S proteasome.  In multiple myeloma, bortezomib can facilitate apoptosis of neoplastic cells by preventing degradation of proapoptotic factors. $#(Choice B)#  Mycophenolate reversibly inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase.  This blocks a critical step in the de novo synthesis of purine nucleotides that is required for proliferation of activated lymphocytes.  Because most other cells have an alternative pathway for purine synthesis that lymphocytes lack, mycophenolate is relatively specific for suppression of B and T cells. $#(Choice C)#  Prednisone and other glucocorticoids bind to cytoplasmic receptors, translocate to the nucleus, and then inhibit the transcription of genes that encode IL-2 and other inflammatory mediators. $#(Choice D)#  Rituximab is a chimeric antibody directed against the CD20 antigen (specific to B lymphocytes).  It depletes B cells (and reduces antibody production) through multiple pathways, including complement-mediated lysis, antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (via natural killer cells), and induction of lymphocyte apoptosis. $#Educational objective# Sirolimus binds to the immunophilin FK binding protein (FKBP) in the cytoplasm, forming a complex that binds and inhibits mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin).  Inhibition of mTOR signaling blocks IL-2 signal transduction and prevents cell cycle progression and lymphocyte proliferation.  "

  "explanation_2": "$Following skin prick testing, this patient developed an erythematous, edematous welt that was followed 3 hours later by an indurated skin lesion.  These findings are consistent with the early and late phases of a @type I hypersensitivity@ reaction. $After first exposure to an allergen (eg, peanuts), antigen specific IgE is produced by B-cells and binds to the surface of mast cells.  If repeat exposure occurs, the bound IgE can cross-link and stimulate the release of preformed histamine and leukotrienes that cause vasodilation and increased capillary permeability.  The result is a rapid (eg, minutes after exposure) #early-phase# type I hypersensitivity response characterized by superficial dermal edema and erythema (eg, @wheal and flare reaction@) that can progress to a more systemic response (eg, anaphylaxis) #(choice D)#. $IgE also initiates the #late phase# of a type I hypersensitivity reaction by stimulating type 2 helper T cells to release cytokines (eg, IL-5) that activate #eosinophils#.  Cationic proteins (eg, #major basic protein#, eosinophil peroxidase) released from eosinophils cause #tissue damage#, which usually manifests as a palpable, #indurated lesion# 2-10 hours following the early-phase reaction. $#(Choice A)#  Binding of preformed IgG antibodies to cell surface antigens initiates cell lysis mediated by complement and/or natural killer cells (@type II hypersensitivity@ reactions).  These reactions can develop hours to days after exposure to an antigen (eg, medications, transfused red blood cells), resulting in destruction of erythrocytes (causing fatigue, pallor), platelets (petechial bleeding), or leukocytes (fever, sepsis). $#(Choice B)#  Immune complex-mediated complement activation typically causes tissue damage in sites where immune complexes tend to deposit (eg, skin, joints, kidneys) days to weeks after initial antigen exposure in @type III hypersensitivity@ reactions.  Although an Arthus reaction can cause local swelling within hours of an exposure, it is usually associated with intradermal injection of a vaccine. $#(Choice E)#  In @type IV (delayed) hypersensitivity@ reactions, CD4+ T cells release cytokines (eg, interferon gamma) that promote T cell- and macrophage-mediated tissue damage.  Although these reactions can also present as an indurated skin lesion (eg, tuberculosis skin testing), type IV hypersensitivity reactions develop over days (rather than hours) because of the time needed for cellular amplification. $#Educational objective# The late phase of dermatologic type I hypersensitivity reactions manifests as an indurated skin lesion hours after exposure to the allergen due to local tissue damage caused by major basic protein released from eosinophils.  In contrast, type IV hypersensitivity reactions develop over days because of the time needed to produce a cell-mediated immune response. ",

Molecular and immunologic advances have led to a dramatic expansion in treatments for chronic systemic inflammatory diseases such as GPA; treatments are generally classified as follows: $• #Cytokine inhibitors:#  These bind free inflammatory cytokines or block cytokine receptors on cell surfaces; they target tumor necrosis factor (eg, infliximab, etanercept), IL-1, IL-6, IL-17, or IL-12/23 #(choice E)#. $• #T-cell costimulation inhibitors:#  Two steps are required to activate cytotoxic T cells.  The T cell must bind a specific antigen on the major histocompatibility complex type 1 of an antigen-presenting cell, and then the T cell must be costimulated by the interaction between the T-cell surface receptor CD28 and the antigen-presenting cell surface ligand CD80/86.  T-cell costimulatory inhibitors (eg, abatacept) block the CD28 receptor on the cytotoxic T cell, which prevents T-cell costimulation and causes T-cell anergy #(choice A)#. $• #B-cell depletion or inhibition:#  Because B cells generate inflammatory cytokines, promote T-cell activation, and differentiate into plasma cells that generate autoantibodies, medications that inhibit B-cell activation (eg, belimumab) or deplete B-cell populations (eg, #rituximab#) are highly effective in many systemic inflammatory disorders. $Rituximab is an #IgG monoclonal antibody against CD20#, a surface molecule present on developing and mature #B cells#.  Binding of rituximab to CD20 results in Fc receptor–mediated B-cell cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent B-cell phagocytosis, which #significantly reduces the B-cell population#.  Although existing plasma cells are unaffected (they do not express CD20), the reduction in total B-cell population significantly improves inflammatory symptoms.  However, depletion of B cells also increases the risk for severe and recurrent bacterial infections, a major adverse effect of therapy. $#(Choice C)#  Natalizumab is a monoclonal antibody against integrin, an adhesion molecule that mediates leukocyte interaction with the endothelium and subsequent leukocyte attachment/migration into tissue.  Natalizumab is used in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. $#(Choice D)#  Cytoplasmic kinases (eg, Janus kinase) transmit inflammatory cytokine receptor binding to the nucleus.  Rituximab does not operate via this mechanism, but new therapies that target these intracellular signaling pathways are under development. $#Educational objective# Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody directed against CD20, a cell surface receptor on developing and mature B cells.

  "explanation_2": "This young woman's rapid-onset high fever, confusion, neck stiffness, and petechial rash likely indicate bacterial meningitis due to #Neisseria meningitidis# infection.  Although healthy, college-aged individuals are at high risk for a single episode of bacterial meningitis, this patient's recurrent pneumonia and previous meningitis suggest an underlying #immune system impairment#.  Culture results from her previous infections are unknown, but the leading cause of pneumonia and meningitis is #Streptococcus pneumoniae#. $The major virulence factor for both N meningitidis and S pneumoniae is a #polysaccharide capsule#, which allows the bacteria to evade the following host defenses: $• #Phagocytosis:#  Capsules have a negative charge, which repels the negative charge of the phagocyte surface.  Capsules are also hydrophilic, which reduces surface tension at the interface between the capsule and the phagocyte, making engulfment more difficult. $• #Opsonization:#  Capsules cover underlying antigenic epitopes on the bacterial cell membrane, which limits immunoglobulin binding.  This impairs immunoglobulin-mediated opsonization and classical complement pathway activation. $Therefore, initial control of encapsulated bacterial infections is largely dependent on the @alternative complement cascade@, which is triggered when autoactivated C3 lands on the bacterial cell and undergoes amplification.  The alternative pathway generates the opsonin C3b (which increases bacterial phagocytosis), but it primarily kills encapsulated bacteria via the creation of #membrane attack complexes# (MACs).  MACs form pores in the bacterial surface, leading to membrane destabilization and osmotic lysis.  Therefore, patients who have defects in the complement proteins that generate the MAC (C5-C9) are at risk for #recurrent, life-threatening infections# from encapsulated bacteria. $#(Choice A)#  DiGeorge syndrome causes T-cell lymphopenia due to congenital absence of the thymus and parathyroid glands.  Absent T-cells cause recurrent viral and fungal infections, not recurrent bacteremia. $#(Choice B)#  Excessive IgE production is seen in hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome.  Although recurrent sinopulmonary infection is common, patients also have severe eczema and recurrent abscesses. $#(Choice C)#  Impaired @neutrophil chemotaxis@ is seen in leukocyte adhesion defects, which prevent neutrophil extravasation and migration to areas of infection.  Although recurrent bacterial infection is common, patients often have a variety of other findings (eg, absence of pus, delayed umbilical cord separation, impaired wound healing). $#(Choice E)#  Chronic granulomatous disease is an X-linked immunodeficiency due to impaired @NADPH oxidase@, which prevents neutrophils from generating an oxidative burst.  Although recurrent pneumonia is common, meningitis is not.  In addition, infections associated with this defect are caused by certain catalase-positive organisms (eg, staphylococci), not encapsulated bacteria (eg, N meningitidis). $#Educational objective# Deficiency of the complement factors that form the membrane attack complex (C5-C9) results in recurrent infections of the lung and meninges by encapsulated bacteria (eg, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis).

  "explanation_2": "#Polyclonal fab antivenom# is a collection of immunoglobulin fragments from the plasma of venom-inoculated animals (eg, horses).  Because the antivenom contains #foreign proteins#, exposure triggers the #adaptive immune response# to form high-affinity IgG antibodies against the foreign components of the antivenom.  This typically takes #1-2 weeks# due to time lag between antigen processing, antigen presentation, CD4 T-lymphocyte activation, and T-cell–mediated B-cell activation/differentiation. $Once formed, IgG then binds to the free-circulating antivenom, which creates #immune complexes# (ICs).  The Fc portion of the IgG triggers clearance of the ICs by activating the classical complement system and by directly binding to the Fc receptor on mononuclear phagocytes in the reticuloendothelial system.  Clearance of ICs generally proceeds without issue when there is minimal antigen because the phagocytic system has a large capacity. $However, the administration of multiple antivenom doses can overwhelm the phagocytic system, leading to the aggregation of ICs in the bloodstream.  Aggregated ICs then #deposit in tissue# (eg, skin, joints), activate the complement cascade, and cause a @type III hypersensitivity@ reaction called #serum sickness#.  Serum sickness generally presents with #fever, urticarial rash#, and #arthralgia# 1-2 weeks after exposure to nonhuman proteins in antivenom, antitoxins, monoclonal antibodies, or vaccinations.  Most cases resolve spontaneously over several days as the ICs are cleared. $#(Choices A and D)#  Antivenom administration can cause IgE antibodies to form against the nonhuman portions of the protein, which then triggers a @type I hypersensitivity@ reaction upon reexposure.  Although these reactions often cause urticaria due to mast cell degranulation, symptoms typically arise within seconds or minutes of reexposure, not a week or two after initial exposure. $#(Choice B)#  Superantigens directly activate polyclonal populations of T cells, leading to acute-onset fever, hypotension, sunburn-like rash, and organ failure.  Fab fragments in antivenom are unlikely to activate T cells directly; they are processed by antigen-presenting cells and lead to the generation of antibodies. $#(Choice C)#  The phagocytic Fc receptor can only bind antivenom that has bound IgG or IgM antibody.  Unbound antivenom cannot attach to phagocytic receptors. $#Educational objective# Serum sickness is an immune complex–mediated type III hypersensitivity reaction that occurs 1-2 weeks after exposure to nonhuman protein in antitoxins (eg, antivenom), monoclonal antibodies (eg, rituximab), or vaccines (eg, rabies antigens).  Deposition of immune complexes in tissue leads to complement activation and subsequent self-limited fever, arthralgia, and urticarial rash. ",

On first exposure to a new antigen, naïve #B cells# become @activated@ and undergo clonal expansion.

However, most activated B cells migrate to lymphoid follicles located in the @lymph node cortex@ where they form #germinal centers#, the major sites of B-cell proliferation and affinity maturation during the immune response.

The immunoglobulin heavy-chain constant regions are isotype specific and distinguish the 5 isotypes (ie, IgM, IgG, IgA, IgE, IgD), whereas the variable regions are antigen specific; light chains are antigen specific and do not determine isotype. $Isotype switching requires interaction of the CD40 receptor on activated B cells with the CD40 ligand on activated helper T cells (#costimulation#).

Central tolerance, acquired during lymphocyte maturation, occurs in the primary lymphoid organs (eg, bone marrow [B cells], thymus [T cells]).  During this process, immature lymphocytes go through negative selection, in which cells that strongly recognize self-antigens undergo apoptosis (ie, deletion). $#(Choices D and E)#  Recombination of the V, D, and J regions of immunoglobulin heavy chains and the V and J regions of light chains occurs via DNA rearrangement during B-cell maturation within the bone marrow.  Although an enormous variety of immunoglobulins can be produced through recombination, after undergoing this process, each B cell makes antibodies of a single specificity. $#Educational objective# The primary immune response to a new antigen initially results in plasma cells that produce only IgM.

It is caused by a mutation in cytoskeleton proteins that are critical for normal cell structure and the cell-to-cell interactions required for activation of hematologic cells (eg, platelets, immune cells). $In patients with WAS, platelets are both abnormally shaped and deficient, causing petechiae, purpura, hematemesis, and epistaxis that can be present at birth.  A deficiency in B cells results in recurrent #pyogenic infections# due to an inability to mount a humoral immune response against organisms with a polysaccharide capsule (eg, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae).

Following contact with these plants, patients develop a #highly pruritic#, erythematous rash consisting of papules, vesicles, and bullae that may show signs of excoriation.  The rash most frequently affects exposed skin (eg, legs, forearms) and often forms #linear streaks# as the patient walks past the plant, dragging it along the skin. $Contact dermatitis is a type IV (#delayed-type#) hypersensitivity reaction that occurs in 2 distinct phases:  $1. The #sensitization phase# leads to the creation of hapten-specific T cells and takes 10-14 days.  Cutaneous dendritic cells take up the haptens and express them on MHC-I and MHC-II molecules as hapten-conjugated peptides.  These dendritic cells travel to the draining lymph nodes and interact with hapten-sensitive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, causing activation and clonal expansion.  $2. The #elicitation phase# occurs within 2-3 days following re-exposure to the same antigen (or following sensitization after first exposure to a highly antigenic antigen such as urushiol).  In this phase, the hapten is taken up by skin cells and causes activation of hapten-sensitized T cells in the dermis and epidermis.  This results in an inflammatory response and the clinical manifestations of contact dermatitis. $Depending on the etiologic agent, contact dermatitis can be mediated primarily by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells or CD4+ TH1 cells (that cause indirect damage by activating macrophages).  In urushiol-induced contact dermatitis, #CD8+ T cells# are the primary effector cells and directly destroy keratinocytes expressing haptenated proteins. $#(Choices A and C)#  Mast cells and basophils, along with IgE, are primarily responsible for type I hypersensitivity allergic reactions.

  "explanation_2": "$#FOXP3# encodes a transcriptional regulator that converts activated CD4 cells into #regulatory T cells# (Treg), a population of T lymphocytes that #inhibit immune activation#.  Expression of FOXP3 drives the production of the following inhibitory cytokines and surface ligands: $• #IL-10# inhibits macrophage function, blocks inflammatory cytokine release by CD4+ T cells, and downregulates expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). $• #Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β)# inhibits B-lymphocyte proliferation/activation and promotes Treg differentiation (eg, FOXP3 expression). $• #Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4)# binds with high affinity to CD80/86 on APCs, a surface protein required for costimulation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells; because CTLA-4 binds up CD80/86, less is available for the activation of T cells. $Mutations in FOXP3 lead to excessive and unregulated T- and B-lymphocyte activity and is associated with a rare genetic disorder called #IPEX# (#I#mmune dysregulation, #P#olyendocrinopathy, #E#nteropathy, and #X#-linked transmission); it is marked by autoimmune enteritis (eg, lymphocytic infiltrate, villous atrophy, chronic diarrhea), eczematous dermatitis, and type 1 diabetes in infancy. $#(Choice A)#  Impaired differentiation of B cells into plasma cells is the hallmark of combined variable immunodeficiency, which typically presents after puberty with recurrent infections (eg, sinopulmonary, gastrointestinal) and autoimmune disease.  Patients have dramatically reduced (not increased) serum immunoglobulins due to a lack of functioning plasma cells. $#(Choice C)#  T-helper cell type 17 (Th17) dysfunction is associated with hyperimmunoglobulin E (Job) syndrome.  Th17 cells assist in neutrophil recruitment and are crucial for pathogen defense at mucosal sites.  Although patients with Job syndrome have eczema and recurrent infection (eg, staphylococcal abscesses), they do not have FOXP3 mutation. $#(Choice D)#  Mutations in CD40 ligand or CD40 prevent activated CD4 cells from triggering activated B cells to undergo @immunoglobulin isotype (class) switching@; this results in overproduction of IgM (hyper-IgM syndrome).  Patients have recurrent infections and chronic diarrhea but not FOXP3 mutation. $#(Choice E)#  Developing T cells that bind too strongly to self MHC die by apoptosis as part of negative selection; therefore, reduced negative (not positive) selection would lead to autoimmunity.  In contrast, positive selection provides survival signals to developing T cells that bind to self MHC with moderate affinity. $#Educational objective# FOXP3 is a transcriptional regulator protein that is required for the development of regulatory T cells; it triggers production of cytokines (eg, IL-10, transforming growth factor-beta) and ligands (eg, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4) that suppress immune activation.  FOXP3 mutations result in immune dysregulation marked by excessive immunoglobulin production and the development of autoimmunity. ",

Perinatal transmission is most common in high-incidence areas (eg, sub-Saharan Africa).  In low-prevalence countries such as the United States, Western Europe, and Canada, most cases arise due to unsafe sexual practices or #injection drug use#. $Serological markers for HBV can be used to distinguish between acute infection, chronic infection, and a protective vaccination response.  #Acute# HBV infection is marked by the proliferation of the virus in hepatocytes with the release of viral antigens (#HBsAg#, #HBeAg#) and #HBV DNA# into the bloodstream and the generation of #IgM against HB core antigen#.  Many patients with acute infection will have subclinical, anicteric disease, but approximately 30% develop several weeks or months of jaundice, fatigue, hepatomegaly, and elevated transaminases. $Most adults with HBV clear the virus and generate protective immunity against future infection.  This is reflected serologically by the following @progression@:  $1. #Anti-HBe# antibodies develop 3-6 months after initial infection and are associated with the elimination of HBeAg.  This correlates with reduced viral replication and infectivity.  $2. HBsAg is eliminated around the time that HBeAg becomes undetectable. $3. #Anti-HBsAg# antibodies form several weeks/months later and provide #protective immunity# against future infection. $#(Choices A and B)#  Patients with chronic hepatitis B have elevated HBsAg >6 months after initial infection.  @Chronic hepatitis B@ with high infectivity is represented by persistent elevation of HBsAg, HBeAg, and HBV DNA with no anti-HBe.  Transition from high infectivity to low infectivity usually occurs years later and is marked by anti-HBe, the elimination of HBeAg, and the continued production of HBsAg. $#(Choice C)#  Patients with an exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B have an abrupt increase in liver enzymes and increased levels of HBV DNA.  Exacerbations are often asymptomatic, but some individuals develop symptoms of acute hepatitis. $#(Choice D)#  Vaccination against hepatitis B would be identified by the presence of anti-HBs with no anti-HBc, anti-HBe, or viral antigens. $#Educational objective# The presence of anti-HBc and anti-HBs antibodies in the serum without detectable viral antigens indicates recovery from acute hepatitis B infection.

  "explanation_2": "This patient from Thailand has hemoptysis, night sweats, right upper lobe infiltrate, and positive sputum acid-fast bacillus stain, raising strong suspicion for #active pulmonary TB#.  Tuberculin skin testing (#TST#) is generally positive in patients with active TB because differentiated lymphocytes recognize injected tuberculin antigens and trigger a strong type IV (cell-mediated) hypersensitivity response, leading to a large wheal of induration within 48-72 hours. $However, approximately 25% of patients with active TB have #false negative TST# (T cell #anergy#).  In these individuals, an #impaired lymphocyte response# results in minimal or no induration after exposure to tuberculin antigens.  Because a weak cell-mediated response increases the #risk of severe disseminated TB#, patients with active disease who have TST anergy are at much greater risk for TB-related morbidity and mortality. $A false-negative TST can also be seen with recent infection (it takes approximately 8 weeks for the cell mediated response to fully form), immunocompromise (eg, HIV), improper injection technique, and natural waning of immunity to latent infection.  Because active TB requires a microbial diagnosis (eg, identifying the organism on sputum sample), neither TST nor interferon-gamma release assay can be used to diagnose or exclude the disease. $#(Choice A)#  Bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccination uses Mycobacterium bovis, which shares antigens with tuberculous mycobacteria.  This vaccination primes the lymphocyte response against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, therefore protecting against infection, morbidity, and mortality.  Patients with previous BCG vaccination can have false-positive (not false negative) TST. $#(Choice B)#  TB infection is primarily controlled by macrophages and T lymphocytes.  The humoral immune system plays a minimal role and does not contribute to TST induration.  Therefore, an autoantibody disorder is unlikely to cause anergy. $#(Choice D)#  Examination of the injection site should occur 48-72 hours after the purified protein derivative is injected in order to give appropriate time for the delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to develop.  Patients with active TB who have a negative TST at 72 hours are likely to have an insufficient lymphocyte response to the infection. $#(Choice E)#  Acid-fast bacillus stain and TST do not differentiate nontuberculous from tuberculous mycobacteria.  Therefore, nontuberculous mycobacterial infection is a common cause of a false-positive (not a false-negative) TST.  This patient's history of residence in a TB-endemic country, hemoptysis, night sweats, and upper lobe infiltrate are all highly suspicious for pulmonary TB. $#Educational objective# Approximately 25% of patients with active TB have false-negative tuberculin skin testing (TST) (anergy) due to an impaired cell-mediated immune response.  These individuals are at greater risk for severe, disseminated disease and death.  False-negative TST can also be seen with immunocompromise, improper injection technique, and recent infection. "

It is found in the gastrointestinal tract of many mammals and in soil worldwide.  Transmission to humans typically occurs when C tetani spores are inoculated into a #skin wound#.  In the anaerobic microenvironment, the spores germinate into a vegetative rod and replicate locally. $Growing C tetani bacteria produce a neurotoxic exotoxin called #tetanospasmin# (tetanus toxin) that travels by retrograde axonal transport through the lower motor neurons to the central nervous system.  There, it acts at the level of the anterior horn cells, #blocking inhibitory neurotransmission#, which results in the clinical syndrome of #tetanus#.  Manifestations include increased muscle tone (eg, @opisthotonos@, lockjaw), painful spasms, and autonomic instability. $In the United States, the #tetanus toxoid vaccine# (formaldehyde-inactivated tetanus toxin) is part of routine childhood vaccinations.

Most vaccinations use peptide antigens or nonpeptides bonded to peptides (ie, conjugate vaccine) so the antigen can be displayed on MHC class II molecules on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), which leads to a much stronger T-cell–mediated immune response. $Vaccines given in series (eg, measles, mumps, and rubella) typically trigger the following immunologic changes: $• #Primary response#:  Upon initial vaccination, foreign antigen binds to and activates B lymphocytes with compatible antigen receptors, leading to clonal B-cell expansion and differentiation into #short-lived plasma cells# that secrete low-affinity IgM.  #Early production of IgM# can be detected in the serum within a few days of immunization.

Most cases are linked to prolonged tampon use or #nasal wound packing#, which provides a medium for localized Staphylococcus aureus proliferation and the elaboration of #pyrogenic toxin superantigens# (eg, toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 [TSST-1]) into the bloodstream. $Pyrogenic toxin superantigens are generated by strains of S aureus (and Streptococcus pyogenes) that have acquired an underlying mobile genetic element via bacteriophage or plasmid.  These exotoxins are called superantigens because they bind to the invariant region of the MHC-II complex of antigen-presenting cells without first being internalized and processed (MHC-II antigens are normally processed by the @phagolysosome@) #(Choice E)#.  The superantigen/MHC-II complex subsequently interacts with the variable part of the T-cell receptor beta chain, which results in the #nonspecific stimulation# of a large percentage (>20%) of total #T cells# and the massive release of inflammatory cytokines (eg, IL-1, IL-2, TNF-alpha & beta, interferon-gamma).  Cytokine release mediates the major manifestations of TSS including fever, increased capillary permeability, and hypotension. $#(Choice A)#  Endotoxin in the cell membrane of gram-negative bacteria can cause rapid-onset fever and hypotension due to activation of toll-like receptors on cells of the innate immune system.  However, in this case, the presence of nasal packing and a diffuse, erythematous rash make TSS far more likely than gram-negative sepsis. $#(Choice C)#  Anaphylactic shock occurs due to antigen-stimulated cross-linking of IgE that is bound to basophils or mast cells, which activates the cell and releases massive amounts of inflammatory mediators.  Anaphylactic shock is typically characterized by hypotension, bronchospasm, and shortness of breath; most cases are triggered by insect stings, food, or medications, and manifestations occur shortly after exposure. $#(Choice D)#  Patients who develop TSS usually have a noninvasive infection in the vaginal canal or area of wound packing.  TSS is mediated by the absorption of superantigens into the blood, not the invasion of bacteria. $#Educational objective# Toxic shock syndrome is typically associated with the prolonged use of tampons or wound packing, which allows Staphylococcus aureus to replicate locally and release pyrogenic toxic superantigens (eg, toxic shock syndrome toxin-1) into the blood.  Superantigens bind to the MHC-II complex of antigen-presenting cells without processing and nonspecifically activate T cells.  This leads to a dramatic release of inflammatory cytokines, which causes the manifestations of the disease (eg, hypotension; high fever; organ failure; diffuse, erythematous rash).",

  "explanation_2": "Traditional vaccinations are generally divided into the following categories: $• #Live attenuated vaccinations# introduce a disabled virus that replicates but causes minimal illness.  Because the virus infects host cells, it produces a long-lasting humoral and cell-mediated immune response against a diverse range of viral antigens that mirrors that of a normal infection. $• #Inactivated vaccinations# introduce viral fragments that are taken up by antigen presenting cells and displayed to B and T lymphocytes.  However, because the virus does not replicate with host cells, they tend to elicit a short-acting humoral immune response and less robust cell-mediated response; multiple doses and booster shots are often required to provide effective immunity. $Although live attenuated and inactivated virus immunizations are effective, their #development requires years# or decades and is often more difficult for nonmicrobial antigens (eg, cancer cell antigens).  In contrast, #mRNA vaccinations# can be #rapidly synthesized# in vitro and can be targeted to produce #any known protein# (eg, viral spike protein, cancer antigens).  Once in the cytoplasm, the exogenous mRNA is translated by host ribosomes to the #encoded viral protein#, which then translocates to the cell surface.  This triggers a strong B- and T-cell–mediated immune response against the foreign protein, leading to long-lasting immunity. $#(Choice A)#  RNase enzymes present in the extracellular milieu as part of the innate immune defense against viruses rapidly destroy unprotected mRNA.  Therefore, mRNA vaccines are generally encased in a carrier compound (eg, lipid bilayer) to protect it and to efficiently deliver it into host cells. $#(Choice C)#  mRNA vaccines provide protective immunity only when the mRNA is translated to its encoded protein and expressed on the surface of host cells.  An adaptive immune response targeting the mRNA directly would not provide protective immunity, as the viral capsid/membrane protects the genome while the viron remains extracellular. $#(Choice D)#  Retroviruses (eg, HIV) can convert their genomic RNA to DNA and then integrate into the host genome.  However, mRNA is transcribed to protein and then degraded within host cells; it is not integrated into the genome. $#Educational objective# mRNA vaccines deliver mRNA molecules encoding foreign protein into the cytoplasm of host cells (particularly antigen presenting cells that avidly engulf the associated carrier compound).  The mRNA is then translated by ribosomes and displayed on the cell surface, leading to a robust adaptive immune response. "

  "explanation_2": "This patient underwent cytotoxic chemotherapy and subsequently developed a bloodstream infection with #Candida albicans#, a small, elliptical, budding yeast.  Visualization of #pseudohyphae#, a chain of budding yeasts joined together with end-to-end at constrictions, is an important diagnostic clue.  C albicans is distinguished from other Candida species by its ability to form #germ tubes# (true hyphae with no constrictions) when incubated at 37 C (98.6 F) for 2-3 hours (ie, germ tube test). $C albicans is a human commensal organism that may cause mucocutaneous infection in otherwise healthy individuals but rarely causes invasive disease.  Protection against infection is mediated by the following: $• Intact epithelium:  Candida triggers toll-like receptors on epithelial cells to release proinflammatory cytokines, which recruit immune cells to the area; epithelial cells also release beta-defensins, which provide antifungal activity. $• Resident macrophages/monocytes:  Penetration of epithelial cells by fungal hyphae causes resident macrophages to release inflammatory cytokines that recruit lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils to the area of infection.  #T helper lymphocytes# specific for Candida antigens help drive the epithelial and macrophage response, and are important for prevention of #superficial Candida infection# (eg, oral/esophageal, cutaneous, vulvovaginitis). $• #Neutrophils:#  Neutrophils are the most important immune cell in the protection against #invasive Candida# (eg, candidemia, deep tissue infections).  Neutrophils kill Candida by releasing reactive oxygen species, lactoferrin, lysozyme, elastase, and beta-defensins.  They are also the only immune cell that is able to prevent germination of Candida yeasts into penetrating hyphae. $Patients who undergo cytotoxic chemotherapy and develop #neutropenia# are at dramatically increased risk for invasive infection.  Indwelling central intravascular catheters are also a major risk factor for invasive disease. $#(Choice A)#  Early complement proteins (eg, C3b, C5b) assist opsonization, and late complement proteins (C5-C9) form the membrane attack complex.  Complement is crucial for control of bacterial infections, but it plays a minimal role in the control of Candida.  In addition, complement levels are not particularly diminished by chemotherapy. $#(Choice B)#  Candida is primarily controlled by neutrophils, macrophages, and helper T cells; immunoglobulins have more of an adjunctive role.  In addition, immunoglobulin levels are not typically affected by most cytotoxic chemotherapy because memory B cells are long lasting and have low rates of cellular division. $#(Choice C)#  Although chemotherapy impairs the production of granulocytes, which include eosinophils, basophils, and neutrophils, transient reduction in eosinophil and basophil count does not drastically increase risk of infection. $#(Choice E)#  T lymphocytes (particularly Th1 and Th17 subtypes) primarily prevent superficial Candida infection by strengthening the mucosal immune defense; conditions that impair cell-mediated immunity (eg, HIV) are associated with higher risk of mucocutaneous Candida infection (eg, thrush, esophagitis).  However, protection against invasive disease is mediated primarily by neutrophils, not lymphocytes. $#Educational objective# Neutrophils are the most important immune cell in the defense against invasive Candida infection; therefore, patients with neutropenia (eg, following cytotoxic chemotherapy) are at high risk for invasive disease (eg, candidemia, meningitis).  In contrast, T lymphocytes are more important for prevention of superficial, mucocutaneous infection (eg, thrush).  "

  "explanation_2": "$Leprosy is a chronic, slowly progressive, communicable disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae that typically involves the skin and peripheral nerves.  Clinical manifestations are widely variable depending on the strength of the TH1 cell-mediated immune response to the organism.  Disease is classified along a spectrum between tuberculoid (mild) to lepromatous (severe) forms.  Patients with tuberculoid leprosy develop a strong TH1-mediated response (interleukin [IL]-2, IFN-γ, and IL-12) in affected tissues, leading to the activation of macrophages that kill M leprae organisms, thereby limiting disease extent.  However, this localized inflammation damages the skin and cutaneous nerves, leading to the development of a small number of hypopigmented, well-demarcated plaques with decreased sensation. $Lepromatous leprosy is a more disseminated form of the disease characterized by an innate inability to recognize and mount a cellular immune response against M leprae antigens.  Affected tissues show extensive accumulation of acid-fast bacilli within macrophages and often a TH2 cytokine profile (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10).  Patients with lepromatous leprosy develop more numerous, poorly demarcated plaques that are widespread across the body.  Over time, the bacterial load increases and the nodular lesions coalesce, causing the development of leonine facies and degeneration and loss of the nose and digits. $The lepromin skin test (in which M leprae antigens are injected intradermally) can be used to distinguish between tuberculoid and lepromatous leprosy.  Patients with tuberculoid leprosy will develop an indurated nodule at the site of the injection (much like a positive PPD test for M tuberculosis).  In contrast, the test is usually nonreactive in patients with lepromatous leprosy due to their weak TH1 cell-mediated immune response. $#(Choice A)#  Patients with lepromatous leprosy have a high bacterial load with widespread involvement throughout the peripheral (cooler) tissues of the body.  As a result, intermittent bacteremia often occurs in the later stages of the disease.  However, this patient's few lesions and positive lepromin skin test are more indicative of tuberculoid leprosy, which has a very low bacterial load with limited tissue involvement. $#(Choice B)#  High serum antimycobacterial antibody levels are more frequently seen in lepromatous leprosy than tuberculous leprosy.  Because M leprae resides mostly within macrophages, circulating immunoglobulins have little access to the organism and are unable to bind, opsonize, or fix complement.  Humoral immunity does not influence the positivity of the lepromin skin test. $#(Choice C)#  In lepromatous leprosy, macrophages remain inactivated due to the inability of TH1 cells to recognize M leprae antigens.  This form of leprosy is characterized by a poor cell-mediated response and diffuse spread of the organism.  This patient is presenting with the tuberculoid form, in which activated macrophages actively kill M leprae organisms. $#(Choice E)#  Acid-fast bacteria typically do not accumulate in the skin lesions of tuberculoid leprosy due to the strong cell-mediated response that is effective at eradicating M leprae.  In some instances, this immune response is so effective that tuberculoid leprosy can be self-limited and heal completely without treatment. $#Educational objective# The lepromin skin test will be positive in patients with tuberculoid leprosy as they exhibit a strong CD4+ TH1 cell-mediated immune response to Mycobacterium leprae.  Patients with lepromatous leprosy will test negative due to their weak TH1 cell-mediated immune response.  "

  "explanation_2": "$#HER2# is an epidermal growth factor receptor overexpressed by aggressive breast cancers.  Treatment with a #monoclonal antibody# (eg, trastuzumab) that targets the HER2 surface receptor often results in tumor regression.  Although antibody binding can trigger cancer cell death through a variety of mechanisms (eg, receptor downregulation, complement deposition), much of the response is due to #antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity# (ADCC). $ADCC classically involves the following:  $1. A naturally occurring or monoclonal #IgG# binds to a complementary surface antigen on a host or foreign cell.  $2. A patrolling #natural killer# (NK) cell binds the #Fc portion# of the attached IgG using #CD16#.  $3. Binding triggers the NK cell to release its #granules#, which contain perforin and #granzymes# (proteases) that induce apoptosis/osmotic lysis of the antibody-bound cell. $Although NK cells are derived from the same lymphocyte lineage as B- and T-cells, they are considered part of the #innate immune system# because they do not engage with major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) to differentiate self from nonself.  Unlike cytotoxic T-cells, NK cells can often identify neoplasms that have downregulated surface expression of MHC-I molecules. $#(Choice A)#  Tumor-infiltrating B cells release inflammatory cytokines, display tumor-associated antigens, and generate tumor-specific immunoglobulin; however, neither B cells nor IgM are involved in mediating responses to exogenously administered monoclonal antibodies. $#(Choice B)#  CD8 cells release effector cytokines (eg, interferon gamma, tumor necrosis factor) and cytotoxic granules (eg, perforin, granzymes) that destroy tumor cells.  However, they interact with the MHC class I receptors, not monoclonal immunoglobulins. $#(Choice D)#  Macrophages and neutrophils also have CD16 and engage in ADCC and @CD16-mediated phagocytosis@ of foreign organisms.  However, their role in antitumor activity is unclear.  The efficacy of monoclonal antibody therapy is thought to be largely mediated by NK-cell ADCC. $#Educational objective# Cancer immunotherapy often includes the administration of monoclonal antibodies against a target overexpressed on the cancer cell surface.  The Fc portion of the bound antibody is identified by natural killer cells via CD16, leading to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity via the release of granzymes and perforin. ",

This patient's positive reaction to Candida antigens (type 4 hypersensitivity) indicates intact T lymphocyte function. $#(Choices D and E)#  The subcapsular sinuses are found between the capsule and the cortex of the lymph node and are in direct communication with afferent lymphatic vessels.  These sinuses are connected to cortical sinuses that line the trabeculae and penetrate through the cortex and paracortex to reach the medulla.  From there, medullary sinuses drain into the efferent lymphatic channel.  These structures are not affected in XLA. $#Educational objective# X-linked (Bruton) agammaglobulinemia is caused by a defect in B cell maturation, resulting in absent mature B cells and severely low immunoglobulin levels.  T cell numbers and function remain intact.  Due to the absence of B cells, primary lymphoid follicles and germinal centers do not form within lymph nodes.  ",

  "explanation_2": "$Leukocyte surface molecules are categorized using #cluster of differentiation# (CD) nomenclature to assist with #immunophenotyping#, the differentiation of immune cells based on cell surface features (ie, with flow cytometry).  Although some CD molecules are expressed on most immune cells (eg, CD45), others are restricted to a specific population of leukocytes. $#CD19# is a transmembrane protein unique to #B lymphocytes# that reduces the cytokine threshold for B-cell activation and proliferation following antigen binding.  Because B-cell cancers (eg, acute lymphocytic leukemia, diffuse B-cell lymphoma) often overexpress CD19 to increase replication rate, anti-CD19 immunotherapy has been developed to treat these malignancies. $#CAR T-cell therapy# is a specific type of immunotherapy that involves the following:  $1. Extraction and purification of T cells from a patient or donor  $2. Genetic modification to form a @chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)@, which combines an extracellular antigen recognition domain for an antigen overexpressed in a tumor with an intracellular stimulatory T-cell signaling domain that promotes T-cell activation/proliferation and tumor-killing activity.  $3. Reinfusion of the modified T cells into the patient $Binding the modified T-cell to its tumor antigen stimulates the release of inflammatory cytokines and promotes destruction of the cancer cell.  The most serious adverse effect is a #life-threatening cytokine storm#, which must be countered with urgent anti–IL-6 treatment (eg, tocilizumab) to prevent death.  In addition, anti-CD19 therapy in particular can also cause #hypogammaglobulinemia# due to destruction of healthy B cells/plasma cells. $#(Choice A)#  Autoimmune endocrinopathy sometimes occurs with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, which targets surface molecules (eg, PD-1, CTLA-4) on cytotoxic T cells.  CD19 is only expressed on B-cells, not T-cells. $#(Choice B)#  Graft versus host disease occurs when allogeneic (non-self) immune cells attack host tissue.  It does not occur with autologous immune cells because these cells are drawn from the patient and adequately differentiate self from non-self. $#(Choice D)#  Myelofibrosis, a chronic myeloproliferative disorder, is associated with exposure to ionizing radiation and toxic chemicals.  However, CAR-T cell therapy is not associated with myelofibrosis.  In addition, risk of secondary malignancy after CAR-T cell therapy appears to be low overall. $#(Choice E)#  Chemotherapy often causes transient myelosuppression due to destruction of rapidly dividing hematopoietic cells.  Anti-CD19 therapy may reduce B-cell populations but does not significantly affect other hematologic cells. $#Educational objective# Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy involves extracting T cells from a patient with malignancy, inserting a CAR gene against a protein overexpressed by the malignancy, and then reinfusing the modified T cells back into the patient.  CAR T-cell therapy against CD19 is used to treat B-cell malignancy because CD19 is expressed only by B cells.  ",

Erythroblastosis fetalis is most commonly caused by Rhesus (Rh) incompatibility (particularly the D antigen). $#Rh sensitization# can occur in an #Rh(D)− mother# during pregnancy with an #Rh(D)+ fetus# due to small amounts of fetal blood crossing the placenta and entering the maternal circulation.  These erythrocytes are viewed as foreign by the maternal immune system and induce the production of anti-Rh(D) IgG antibodies.

The severe anemia also stimulates release of immature, nucleated erythrocytes and leads to persistent extramedullary hematopoiesis in the liver, spleen, and other tissues (hepatosplenomegaly). $#(Choice A)#  Sickle cell anemia causes vasoocclusion due to abnormal hemoglobin polymerization.  It is asymptomatic in the fetus/neonate due to high levels of fetal hemoglobin that are not replaced by hemoglobin S until age 3-12 months. $#(Choice B)#  Fetuses with homozygous alpha-thalassemia (hemoglobin Barts) have no alpha globin chains and therefore form gamma-4 tetramers with very high oxygen affinity.  The consequence is severe functional anemia and tissue hypoxia, which results in high-output heart failure and nonimmune hydrops fetalis (negative Coombs test). $#(Choice D)#  Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency can cause prolonged neonatal jaundice (beyond 2 weeks) due to increased erythrocyte breakdown and immaturity of the newborn liver.  However, the associated anemia is rarely severe. $#(Choice E)#  Infants are born with an immature immune system; their humoral defense during the first 6 months of life comes primarily from maternal circulating IgG that is received transplacentally prior to birth and from mucosal IgA received via breastfeeding.  Therefore, fetal antibody-mediated red blood cell lysis is an unlikely etiology. $#Educational objective# Hemolytic disease of the newborn most commonly occurs from maternal sensitization to Rh antigens during a prior pregnancy with an Rh(D)+ fetus.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient from Southeast Asia has weight loss, cough, and an apical infiltrate with acid-fast bacilli, raising strong suspicion for #pulmonary tuberculosis#.  Mycobacterium tuberculosis is transmitted to the lungs via aerosolized droplets.  It initially replicates in an @unchecked fashion@ within the alveoli and alveolar macrophages due to virulence factors (eg, cord factor) that prevent macrophage-mediated destruction.  After a few weeks, infected macrophages in the draining lymphatic system display mycobacterial antigens on major histocompatibility complex @(MHC) class II@ molecules, leading to the #stimulation of CD4 T lymphocytes#. $Stimulated CD4 cells #release interferon-gamma# that activates macrophages, greatly increasing their ability to kill phagocytized organisms.  Activated macrophages can also differentiate into epithelioid histiocytes and coalesce into #multinucleated Langhans giant cells# that wall off mycobacteria within granulomas.  The center of the granuloma is acidic and hypoxic, which causes it to appear acellular, necrotic, and \"cheese-like\" (#caseating#).  Granulomas typically limit mycobacterial proliferation but do not fully eliminate the infection. $Although Langhans giant cells are an important component of the immunologic response to pulmonary tuberculosis, they are a nonspecific finding that may also be present in other chronic infectious or inflammatory conditions (eg, sarcoidosis, Crohn disease). $#(Choice A)#  Some intracellular bacterial pathogens (eg, Listeria, Rickettsia) have virulence factors that allow them to escape the phagosome and replicate within the cytosol.  These pathogens are primarily processed by the proteasome (rather than the lysosome), leading to the display of bacterial protein fragments on @MHC class I molecules@.  MHC class I molecules stimulate cytotoxic T cells (CD8 lymphocytes).  In contrast, phagocytosed bacteria that remain within the phagosome (eg, M tuberculosis) are broken down by the lysosome and displayed on MHC class II molecules, which activate CD4, not CD8, cells. $#(Choice B)#  Epstein-Barr virus attacks B lymphocytes and leads to long-term, latent infection that is typically asymptomatic but can occasionally lead to B-lymphocyte malignant transformation.  Although malignant transformation can cause large, atypical cells, acid-fast bacilli would not be seen on culture. $#(Choice C)#  Fibroblast proliferation and collagen production contribute to caseating granuloma formation but do not cause macrophage activation, which is necessary for the formation of multinucleated Langhans giant cells. $#(Choice D)#  Neutrophils (polymorphonuclear cells) have multilobed nuclei that would be visible at this magnification.  Neutrophils play a major role in early inflammation and elimination of extracellular bacterial pathogens (eg, Staphylococcus aureus).  However, they are not the primary effector cell in the elimination of facultative intracellular pathogens such as M tuberculosis. $#Educational objective# Mycobacterium tuberculosis triggers CD4 T lymphocytes to release interferon-gamma, which leads to macrophage activation (improves intracellular killing ability) and differentiation into epithelioid histiocytes.  These cells, along with horseshoe-shaped, multinucleated Langhans giant cells (fused, activated macrophages) are a key component of granuloma formation. ",

  "explanation_2": "$This patient has cough, fever, weight loss, and an upper lobe lesion on chest x-ray, raising strong suspicion for #active pulmonary tuberculosis#.  Mycobacterium tuberculosis cannot be visualized on Gram stain due to the high lipid content (mycolic acid) of its cell wall.  Most cases are diagnosed by acid-fast sputum testing and culture, but tissue microscopy typically shows granulomas characterized by #epithelioid histiocytes# and #multinucleated Langhans giant cells#. $#Granulomas# often form after tissue macrophages encounter pathogens or substances that cannot be easily digested or removed.  M tuberculosis can @evade intracellular killing@ by macrophages and reproduce within phagolysosomes.  Infected macrophages present mycobacterial antigens to naïve CD4 helper T cells in pulmonary lymph nodes and secrete @IL-12@, which induces activated T helper cells to differentiate into #T helper subtype 1 (Th1) cells#. $Proliferating Th1 cells migrate to sites of infection, where they release #interferon-gamma#, which #activates macrophages#, improves intracellular killing of ingested mycobacteria, and recruits additional macrophages by increasing production of #tumor necrosis factor-alpha#.  Activated macrophages can also limit the spread of mycobacteria by differentiating into epithelioid and giant cells that surround residual foci of mycobacteria, trapping them inside the necrotic, cheese-like area of a caseating granuloma. $#(Choice A)#  C3a is a split product anaphylatoxin derived from C3.  It stimulates the release of histamine by mast cells, which increases vascular permeability and vasodilation. $#(Choice B)#  Fibroblast growth factor has a variety of proliferative effects, including stimulation of angiogenesis and fibroblast proliferation during formation of @granulation tissue@.  It does not have a primary role in the formation of granulomas. $#(Choice C)#  Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor induces stem cell differentiation into monocytes and other granulocytes (eg, neutrophils, eosinophils).  However, it does not induce granuloma formation. $#(Choice D)#  IL-4 is a cytokine that stimulates the differentiation of naïve CD4 T cells into the Th2 subset, which plays an important role in humoral immunity and allergic reactions by stimulating B-cell proliferation and isotype switching to IgE. $#(Choice E)#  Interferon-alpha is a primary mediator of the immune response to virus-infected cells.  However, in contrast to interferon-gamma, it limits macrophage proliferation and does not drive granuloma formation. $#Educational objective# T helper subtype 1 cells release interferon-gamma, leading to the activation of macrophages, a process critical for control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.  Activated macrophages form mature phagolysosomes that destroy phagocytosed mycobacteria and can differentiate into epithelioid and Langhans giant cells to wall off extracellular mycobacteria within caseating granulomas.

On the other hand, #Th2 cells# play a prominent role in allergic response and #type I hypersensitivity reactions#. $One hypothesis for the #pathogenesis of asthma# is an excess of Th2 cell activity relative to Th1 cell activity, resulting in excessive IgE production, an abnormal propensity for type I hypersensitivity reactions, and associated chronic eosinophilic bronchitis.  In the asthma #sensitization phase#, inhaled antigens stimulate Th2 cells to secrete #IL-4# and other lymphokines to stimulate B-cell antibody production as part of humoral adaptive immunity.  Th2 cells also release #IL-13#, which, together with IL-4, promotes B-cell immunoglobulin @class switching to IgE@ and leads to mast cell priming. $Repeat exposure to inhaled antigens leads to mast cell degranulation of inflammatory substances (eg, histamine, leukotrienes) and further activation of eosinophils with release of tissue-damaging substances (eg, major basic protein). $#(Choice A)#  IL-1 is predominantly involved in the Th1 response and stimulates fever and acute inflammation.  It also induces lymphokine secretion to recruit other leukocytes, including lymphocytes. $#(Choice B)#  IL-3 is secreted by both Th1 and Th2 cells and promotes the growth and differentiation of bone marrow stem cells. $#(Choice D)#  IL-5 is secreted by activated Th2 cells and stimulates the growth and differentiation of eosinophils.

It can be produced by T lymphocytes, platelets, macrophages, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and keratinocytes. $#Educational objective# An excess of Th2 cell activity relative to Th1 cell activity may underlie the pathogenesis of asthma.  In the asthma sensitization phase, inhaled antigens stimulate Th2 cells to secrete IL-4 and IL-13, which together promote B-lymphocyte class switching for IgE synthesis, leading to mast cell priming.

  "explanation_2": "$#Mycobacterium tuberculosis# is transmitted by aerosolized droplets from a patient with active pulmonary tuberculosis.  Initially, the pathogen replicates in an unchecked fashion due to virulence factors (eg, cord factor) that allow the bacteria to escape destruction within the phagolysosomes of alveolar macrophages.  After a few weeks, antigen-presenting cells in the draining lymphatic system display mycobacterial antigens on major histocompatibility complex class II molecules and release #interleukin-12#, which differentiates #naïve CD4 cells# into T-helper subtype-1 (#Th1#) cells. $Th1 cells migrate to the sites of infection and secrete #interferon-gamma#, resulting in the #activation of macrophages#.  Activated macrophages are able to form fully mature phagolysosomes to destroy intracellular mycobacteria.  They also differentiate into cells (eg, epithelioid, Langhans giant cells) that surround extracellular mycobacteria and form granulomas.  Granulomas have an acidic, hypoxic central environment that limits the proliferation of mycobacteria but does not usually eliminate the infection. $Because the cell-mediated response to M tuberculosis takes several weeks to form, recently exposed patients frequently have a negative initial tuberculin skin test (as in this patient).  Although most patients with primary tuberculosis have no symptoms and no chest x-ray findings, after several months, a Ranke complex (calcified lower lobe nodule and ipsilateral hilar lymph node) can often be seen on x-ray. $#(Choice A)#  Facultative, intracellular organisms such as M tuberculosis are protected from antibodies and complement when within cells.  As a result, elimination of these pathogens does not primarily rely on the humoral immune system (eg, B lymphocytes). $#(Choice C)#  Neutrophils are a crucial immune component for control of most extracellular bacterial infections (eg, Streptococcus pneumoniae).  However, macrophages are the more important effector cells for control of M tuberculosis and many other intracellular bacterial infections. $#(Choice D)#  Intracellular organisms that replicate in the cytosol, such as viruses or certain intracellular bacteria (eg, Listeria), are processed by the proteasome and displayed on major histocompatibility complex @(MHC) class I molecules@.  This leads to the activation of CD8 T lymphocytes.  M tuberculosis primarily replicates within the phagosome (not the cytosol), leading to display of mycobacterial antigens on MHC class II molecules and the subsequent activation of CD4, rather than CD8, cells. $#(Choice E)#  Natural killer cells are cytotoxic lymphocytes that can recognize damaged or infected cells without requiring MHC activation.  They are important for clearing viral infections and for tumor immunosurveillance, but are not the primary effector cell in tuberculosis infection. $#Educational objective# Mycobacterium tuberculosis primarily replicates within the phagosome, leading to display of mycobacterial antigens on major histocompatibility complex class II molecules.

HSP is caused by the deposition of #IgA immune complexes# in small-vessel walls and may be precipitated by an upper respiratory tract infection, as seen in this patient. $HSP renal disease is an immune-mediated glomerulonephritis with microscopic features identical to @IgA nephropathy@: $• #Mesangial deposition# of IgA immune complexes triggers #mesangial cell proliferation# and extracellular matrix deposition, primarily via enhanced expression of platelet-derived growth factor and transforming growth factor beta. $• IgA Immune complexes also trigger #complement activation# via the alternative and lectin pathways; hydrolyzed complement proteins (eg, c5a) act as chemokines that attract #neutrophils#, which produce oxidants and release proteases (eg, elastase) that are damaging to glomerular capillaries. $• Macrophages may also be recruited to the glomerulus, where they cause further damage to glomerular capillaries, promote #fibrin deposition#, and contribute to #crescent formation# in severe cases. $Most children with HSP-related renal disease have mild nephritis characterized by #hematuria#, red blood cell (RBC) casts, non–nephrotic range proteinuria, and a normal creatinine.

Although patients have nephritic syndrome with hematuria and RBC casts, arthralgias and purpura are not seen. $#(Choice D)#  Prothrombotic conditions (eg, antiphospholipid syndrome) can cause thrombosis of the glomerular capillaries, and urinalysis may show hematuria and/or proteinuria.  Although purpura may occur due to consumptive thrombocytopenia, the lesions would be diffuse, not localized to the lower extremities (immune complex vasculitis tends to affect dependent areas of the skin).  In addition, his recent upper respiratory tract infection is more characteristic of HSP. $#(Choice E)#  In rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, activated T lymphocytes secrete cytokines that stimulate macrophage activity, a process that contributes to crescent formation.

His #antecedent skin infection#, along with overt @nephritic syndrome@ (eg, hypertension, generalized edema, #gross hematuria# [cola- or red-colored urine]) is suggestive of #poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis# (PSGN).  This disease is the most common cause of acute nephritis in children and typically manifests 2-4 weeks after a skin infection. $During infection, IgG antibodies form against nephritogenic antigens expressed by certain strains of group A Streptococcus.  These antibodies complex with streptococcal antigens to form #immune complexes# that are deposited along the glomerular basement membrane (#type III hypersensitivity#).  Subsequent activation of the complement cascade leads to neutrophil recruitment and inflammatory damage to the glomeruli. $#(Choices A and E)#  Cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes and macrophages play a prominent role in type IV (delayed-type) hypersensitivity reactions.  These cells are stimulated by T-helper cells, leading to localized inflammation, cellular destruction, and (often) granuloma formation.  Although certain forms of acute interstitial nephritis are due to type IV hypersensitivity, gross hematuria is uncommon and affected patients classically present with fever, rash, and eosinophilia. $#(Choice B)#  Histamine is released by mast cells and basophils during type I (immediate) hypersensitivity, which is seen with anaphylaxis and allergies, not PSGN.  Mast cells and basophils are coated by IgE molecules, which cross-link on antigen exposure, triggering the release of histamine and other mediators. $#(Choice C)#  Direct binding of autoantibodies to tissue is responsible for type II (cytotoxic) hypersensitivity reactions.  This underlies Goodpasture syndrome (antibodies directed at type IV collagen), which can cause generalized edema (glomerulonephritis) and hemoptysis (diffuse alveolar hemorrhage).  However, PSGN is a much more common cause of glomerulonephritis in children. $#Educational objective# Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is the most common cause of nephritic syndrome (eg, hematuria, edema, hypertension) in children, typically occurring 2-4 weeks after a streptococcal skin infection (eg, impetigo, cellulitis).

Hair products, including dye, frequently contain allergenic molecules (eg, p-phenylenediamine) that can cause #allergic contact dermatitis# (ACD).  ACD is a @type IV hypersensitivity@ (delayed-type) reaction that occurs in 2 phases:  $1. #Sensitization:#  Cutaneous #Langerhans cells# take up haptens (small molecules that bind to proteins and alter their immune appearance) and present hapten-peptide complexes to naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in regional lymph nodes, resulting in clonal expansion of hapten-sensitive T cells.  This phase takes #10-14 days# and does not result in cutaneous lesions.  $2. #Elicitation:#  On reexposure to the hapten, sensitized T cells are recruited to skin for activation by hapten-protein conjugates displayed on cutaneous antigen-presenting cells.  Activated #CD8+ T cells#, the main effector cells in ACD, release cytotoxins (eg, perforin, granzymes) and express Fas ligand to induce keratinocyte apoptosis.  They also amplify the inflammatory response by releasing cytokines (eg, #interferon gamma#) and recruiting additional inflammatory cells (eg, macrophages).  This phase occurs #2-3 days# following reexposure to the hapten and results in erythema, pruritus, and vesicles. $#(Choice B)#  Mast cells are primarily responsible for immediate (@type I@) hypersensitivity reactions.  On reexposure, allergens bind to allergen-specific IgEs on mast cells, causing immediate degranulation and release of vasoactive peptides (eg, histamine), resulting in @urticaria@ and, when severe, anaphylaxis.  Onset is rapid (minutes), unlike this patient's delayed (48-hr) response.  Furthermore, individual wheals of urticaria resolve within 24 hours, rather than days. $#(Choice C)#  Neutrophils phagocytose bacteria and fungi and kill them by generating reactive oxygen species (NADPH oxidase) and hypochlorous acid (myeloperoxidase).  Although neutrophils play a role in defense against cutaneous infections (eg, cellulitis, which is painful rather than pruritic), this patient's rash is more consistent with contact dermatitis. $#(Choice D)#  Immunoglobulins produced by plasma cells are responsible for @type II and III@ hypersensitivity reactions.  ACD does not involve plasma cells or antibodies. $#(Choice E)#  Regulatory T cells are CD4+ lymphocytes that play an inhibitory role in the immune response.  They secrete cytokines (eg, interleukin-10) that inhibit macrophage function and antagonize proinflammatory cytokines (eg, interferon gamma).  This anti-inflammatory effect is important in suppressing autoimmune diseases. $#Educational objective# Allergic contact dermatitis is a type IV (delayed-type) hypersensitivity reaction.  Initially, Langerhans cells present haptens to naive T cells, leading to clonal expansion.  On reexposure, sensitized CD8+ T cells are recruited to skin and destroy tissue.

  "explanation_2": "$Neoplastic cells produce proteins not found in healthy cells.  Pieces of these proteins #(neoantigens)# are displayed on MHC class I molecules on the cell surface and are subsequently recognized by #cytotoxic T cells# as \"nonself\" (leading to cellular apoptosis).  However, neoplastic cells generally accumulate genetic mutations that allow them to thwart the cytotoxic T-cell response and evade detection/destruction.  One common mechanism is the overexpression of #programmed death-ligand 1# (PD-L1) on the cancer cell surface; this ligand binds to the PD-1 receptor on cytotoxic T cells and suppresses their ability to induce apoptosis (#T-cell exhaustion#). $Treatment with monoclonal antibodies that block PD-1 such as #pembrolizumab# have shown promise in cancers that overexpress PD-L1 (eg, #melanoma#, renal cell carcinoma).  #Blockade of PD-1# restores the cytotoxic T-cell response (disinhibition), which #promotes tumor cell apoptosis#.  Patients with advanced melanoma and other susceptible malignancies often have a drastic clinical response (eg, tumor regression, long-term remission) to PD-1 antagonists. $#(Choices A and E)#  Cancer-related inflammation also involves cells of the innate immune system such as macrophages and neutrophils.  These cells can have either protumor (eg, release of matrix metalloproteases that facilitate invasion) and antitumor (eg, direct killing of cancer cells) activities depending on the local cytokine milieu.  However, PD-1 inhibitors do not increase the antitumor activity of neutrophils or macrophages. $#(Choice B)#  Tumor cells often induce desmoplasia, which refers to excessive connective tissue/stroma growth around the tumor.  A strong desmoplastic response can reduce the ability of chemotherapeutic agents to penetrate into the tumor, leading to chemoresistance. $#(Choice C)#  Angiogenesis inhibitors (eg, bevacizumab) are used to prevent neovascularization of growing tumors, leading to ischemia and tumor necrosis.  PD-1 inhibitors cause cytotoxic T-cell activation, leading to increased apoptosis of tumor cells; they do not induce ischemic necrosis. $#Educational objective# Programmed-death receptor 1 (PD-1) is a checkpoint inhibitor that downregulates the cytotoxic T-cell response.  Neoplastic cells often exploit this receptor via the overexpression of PD-1 ligand.  PD-1 receptor inhibitors (eg, Pembrolizumab) restore the T-cell response, allowing cytotoxic T cells to invade the tumor and induce apoptosis of neoplastic cells.  "

Later, osteopenia, erosions, and joint space narrowing lead to decreased range of motion and #deformities# (eg, @swan neck@, @ulnar deviation@).  Patients can also develop @rheumatoid nodules@, firm, nontender, subcutaneous nodules that often occur at pressure points such as the elbows or forearms. $RA is due to failure of immune tolerance, with development of an autoreactive immune response directed against joint components (eg, type II collagen, citrullinated vimentin).  CD4+ T-helper cells become activated by these self-antigens and release cytokines that promote chronic inflammatory synovitis.  CD4+ T cells also induce B cells to synthesize #rheumatoid factor# and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs). $Rheumatoid factor is an antibody (typically IgM) specific for the #Fc component of IgG#.

The axoneme of flagella and motile cilia consists of a circular array of microtubule doublets surrounding 2 central microtubules (9+2 arrangement); the axoneme is anchored to the cell by a basal body.  Each doublet has an A and B subunit and is connected to the adjacent doublet via dynein arms.  These dynein arms contain an ATPase that generates energy to slide the microtubules past each other, producing ciliary movement.  Primary ciliary dyskinesia can result from failure of the #dynein arms# to develop normally. $Patients with PCD experience #recurrent respiratory infections# (eg, chronic sinusitis, bronchiectasis) as a result of impaired mucociliary clearance.  In addition, impaired ciliary movement during embryogenesis can cause #situs inversus# (reversed right/left positioning of internal organs).  #Infertility# in men (impaired sperm motility) and women (immobility of fallopian tube cilia) is another frequent manifestation. $#(Choice A)#  Deficiency of the C1 complement component causes increased susceptibility to encapsulated bacteria (eg, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis) and also predisposes to developing systemic lupus erythematosus. $#(Choice B)#  Epithelial cell chloride channels are defective in cystic fibrosis.  Although patients with cystic fibrosis typically have recurrent respiratory infections and infertility, dextrocardia/situs inversus are not seen. $#(Choice D)#  Defects in T-cell IL-2 receptors can cause severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID). $#(Choice E)#  Immunoglobulin gene rearrangement is impaired in hyper-IgM syndrome.  In this disorder, B cells produce high amounts of IgM but are unable to switch production to other immunoglobulin classes. $#(Choice F)#  NADPH oxidase deficiency causes chronic granulomatous disease. $#Educational objective# Kartagener syndrome is a form of primary ciliary dyskinesia characterized by the triad of situs inversus, chronic sinusitis, and bronchiectasis.  It occurs due to mutations that impair the structure or function of cilia.  Cystic fibrosis also causes chronic respiratory infections, but it is not associated with situs inversus.  ",

IL-10 reduces production of proinflammatory TH1 cytokines (IL-2 and interferon gamma) and major histocompatibility complex class II expression (important for antigen presentation and T-helper cell response).  It also inhibits activated dendritic cells and macrophages.  These effects of IL-10 result in the attenuation of cellular-mediated immunity with some enhancement of the humoral response, leading to a protective effect in Crohn disease. $#(Choice A)#  IL-1, produced by macrophages and epithelial cells, has proinflammatory properties such as endothelium activation, increased chemokine expression (promoting leukocyte recruitment), and induction of fever.  IL-1β is important for differentiation of TH17 cells. $#(Choice B)#  IL-5 is secreted by TH2 cells and promotes the humoral response by stimulating differentiation of B cells and increasing IgA production.  It also promotes the growth and differentiation of eosinophils and is implicated in the pathogenesis of many allergic diseases (eg, asthma). $#(Choice D)#  IL-12 is secreted by macrophages and induces differentiation of TH1 cells and activation of natural killer cells. $#(Choice E)#  Interferon gamma is secreted by TH1 cells and promotes proinflammatory pathways by activating macrophages, increasing antigen presentation, and inducing the death of epithelial cells. $#(Choice F)#  Tumor necrosis factor–alpha, produced by macrophages, natural killer cells, and T cells, is a proinflammatory mediator that promotes leukocyte recruitment and activates the endothelium (increases expression of adhesion molecules). $#Educational objective# Of the cytokines released in the setting of tissue injury, IL-10 plays important anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory roles, especially in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease.

High-dose IL-2 infusions can also be administered to patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma or metastatic melanoma in order to increase #antitumor lymphocyte activity#, as follows: $• #CD4 cells:#  IL-2 converts activated CD4 cells into type 1 T-helper cells, which then secrete inflammatory cytokines (eg, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-2) that drive an antitumor response. $• #CD8 cells:#  IL-2 expands the pool of activated CD8 cells and increases their cytotoxic killing with granzymes and perforins. $• #NK cells:#  IL-2 triggers proliferation of NK cells and #dramatically increases# their #cytotoxic activity#; most of the antitumor effect of IL-2 therapy comes from increased NK cell activity. $Although patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma who undergo IL-2 therapy may enter long-lasting remission, high-dose IL-2 treatment is nonspecific and causes significant adverse effects due to excessive cytokine production (eg, capillary leak syndrome).  Therefore, most patients are now treated with newer immunotherapy agents such as CTLA-4 inhibitors (eg, ipilimumab) or PD-1 protein inhibitors (eg, nivolumab) that deliver more targeted therapy and are better tolerated. $#(Choice A)#  Tumor hypoxia and lactic acid production increase release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which promotes angiogenesis required for tumor growth.
