This process, which occurred over 3 weeks, involved the formation of well-vascularized connective tissue (ie, granulation tissue) at the wound base and resurfacing of the wound with new epithelium (ie, reepithelialization). $Reepithelialization is triggered when injury to the skin disrupts most or all of the layers of the @epidermis@, resulting in #loss of keratinocyte-to-keratinocyte contact#.  Contact with other keratinocytes typically limits cell division and/or motility (ie, contact inhibition).  However, when this contact is lost due to injury, keratinocytes are #stimulated to replicate# and migrate until a continuous epithelial layer is restored. $From the wound edges, keratinocytes #migrate across# newly formed #granulation tissue# at the wound base and are replenished via replication of basal keratinocytes in the stratum basale.  This process continues until keratinocytes meet other keratinocytes (ie, #contact inhibition#), corresponding with #completion of reepithelization# (eg, wound covered in pearly pink epithelium).  At this point, proliferation and migration signals cease, and the stratification process begins. $#(Choice A)#  During the proliferation phase of wound healing, transforming growth factor-beta induces some fibroblasts to differentiate into myofibroblasts that produce intracellular contractile proteins (eg, actin, myosin).  Myofibroblast contraction helps decrease the size of the wound. $#(Choice C)#  Melanocytes are melanin-producing cells that reside within the stratum basale.  They are derived from neural crest cells and are distinct from basal cells (ie, keratinocyte stem cells).  Failure of melanocytes to migrate into a healing scar can lead to permanent scar hypopigmentation. $#(Choice D)#  Several immune cells, including neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells, are responsible for pathogen phagocytosis during the inflammatory phase of wound healing.  Macrophages are of particular importance for clearing foreign bodies and cellular debris (eg, apoptotic neutrophils). $#Educational objective# Keratinocytes are responsible for wound reepithelization.  They migrate into the wound from its edges and are repopulated by replication within the stratum basale.  Keratinocytes continue to migrate and proliferate until they contact other similar cells, a regulatory mechanism known as contact inhibition.  ","clickable_1":"images/img1.20884.jpg"},

During the proliferation phase, fibroblasts multiply and synthesize ground substance and type III collagen, which form an amorphous gel into which new capillaries can grow.  In addition, fibroblasts secrete #fibroblast growth factor# and #vascular endothelial growth factor#, which stimulate endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and differentiationâ€”leading to the formation of new capillaries. $By increasing the number of capillaries within the healing surgical incision, angiogenesis increases blood flow to the area, causing the #pink and slightly warm# characteristics of the wound at this stage.  The incision's newly formed epithelium (ie, reepithelialization) typically has a shiny appearance as well. $#(Choices A and C)#  Degranulation of mast cells and infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes occur during the inflammation phase, which starts within hours of the injury and lasts approximately 5 days.  During this phase, there is often moderate edema, redness, and/or warmth of the wound and nearby soft tissues due to high levels of inflammatory mediators (eg, IL-1, TNF-alpha).  In contrast, this patient's wound is 10 days out from surgery and most likely in the proliferation phase. $#(Choice B)#  Extensive collagen crosslinking, which increases the tensile strength of the wound, occurs during the final phase of wound healing, maturation.  Maturation typically occurs between 3 weeks and 1-2 years (not 10 days post-surgery). $#(Choice E)#  Collagen synthesis begins during the proliferation phase, along with angiogenesis.  However, fibroblasts predominantly synthesize type III collagen; type III collagen is then replaced with type I collagen during the maturation phase.  @Type II collagen@ is primarily found in articular and hyaline cartilage rather than the skin. $#Educational objective# Angiogenesis is the process by which new blood vessels are formed.
