Each strain is then cultured on a new growth medium containing only glucose.  Representative colonies of each strain from the new media undergo Western blot processing using a fluorescently labeled probe specific for β-galactosidase.  Wild-type bacterial colonies are found to contain only trace quantities of β-galactosidase.  However, the mutant colonies express significant amounts of β-galactosidase.  Further analysis reveals that the variant strain contains a mutation that inhibits the binding of a certain protein to its regulatory sequence.  In which of the following locations did this mutation most likely occur?",

  "explanation_2": "$The #lac operon# consists of a regulatory gene (#lac I#), a promoter region (#lac p#), an operator region (#lac o#), and three structural genes (#lac Z#, #lac Y#, and #lac A#).  The lac Z gene codes for β-galactosidase, which is responsible for the hydrolysis of lactose to glucose and galactose.  The lac Y gene codes for permease, which allows lactose to enter the bacterium.  The lac p region is the binding site for RNA polymerase during the initiation of transcription.  The Lac I repressor protein is the product of the lac I gene and is constitutively expressed.  Repressor proteins, when bound to the operator region, prevent binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter region, thus decreasing transcription of the lac Z, lac Y, and lac A genes.  Culture of E coli in lactose-containing media causes a conformational change in the repressor protein, preventing its attachment to the operator region and increasing transcription of the lac operon structural genes. $Culturing E coli in media containing glucose results in reduced expression of the lac operon, even when the media contains lactose as well.  This occurs because the lac operon is positively regulated by the binding of catabolite activator protein (CAP) to a site slightly upstream from the promoter region.  This only occurs when cAMP concentrations are high.  Since glucose decreases the activity of adenylyl cyclase (reducing intracellular cAMP), the lac operon is repressed in high-glucose conditions.  In summary, the lac operon is regulated by 2 distinct mechanisms:  $1. Negatively by binding of the repressor protein to the operator locus  $2. Positively by cAMP-CAP binding upstream from the promoter region $Mutations impairing the binding of the repressor protein to its binding site at the operator region will prevent repression of the genes of the lac operon in the absence of lactose.  This results in increased transcription of the genes of the lac operon in lactose-deficient media, although the presence of glucose will prevent maximal transcriptional activity. $#(Choices A and D)#  Mutations that impair the binding of cAMP-CAP to its regulatory site upstream from the promoter will decrease transcription of the lac operon, as cAMP-CAP is a positive regulator. $#(Choices C and E)#  Mutations impairing the binding of RNA polymerase to the promotor region will also reduce transcription of the lac operon. $#Educational objective# The lac operon is regulated by two distinct mechanisms: negatively by binding of the repressor protein to the operator locus and positively by cAMP-CAP binding upstream from the promoter region.  Constitutive expression of the structural genes of the lac operon occurs with mutations that impair the binding of the repressor protein (Lac I) to its regulatory sequence in the operator region.

  "explanation_2": "This patient's rheumatoid arthritis is being treated with adalimumab, a #tumor necrosis factor# (TNF)-#alpha inhibitor#.  TNF-alpha is a crucial cytokine of the cell-mediated immune response that aids in macrophage activation, phagolysosome function, and the formation and maintenance of @granulomas@.  Blockade of TNF-alpha #increases the risk of infection# with pathogens controlled by the cell-mediated immune response such as intracellular bacteria (eg, Mycobacterium tuberculosis), viruses, and granulomatous fungi. $This patient's pulmonary and reticuloendothelial (eg, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly) findings and positive urine fungal antigen test raise strong suspicion for infection with #Histoplasma capsulatum#, a dimorphic fungus endemic to the #Ohio# and Mississippi River Valleys.  H capsulatum is a mold that is inhaled from contaminated soil and converts to a yeast form in the lungs.  Phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages does not result in destruction of the organism due to microbial virulence factors that prevent phagolysosome acidification.  Therefore, for the first several weeks of infection, @H capsulatum@ is able to #proliferate within macrophages# in an unchecked fashion. $Eventually, the cell-mediated immune response controls the infection in most healthy patients.  However, those with impaired immunity (as in this case) are at high risk for life-threatening #disseminated disease#.  The lungs, reticuloendothelial system, and mouth (oral ulcers) are most commonly affected.  Urine Histoplasma antigen testing is often used to quickly confirm the diagnosis. $#(Choice B)#  Aspergillus fumigatus is a monomorphic mold that can cause invasive disease in those who are immunocompromised.  This organism is inhaled into the lungs and can invade the vascular endothelial lining, leading to dissemination through the bloodstream.  However, patients usually have fever, chest pain, and hemoptysis. $#(Choice C)#  Candida species are part of the endogenous human flora, but overgrowth can occur in those with immunocompromisation and lead to mucocutaneous (eg, thrush) or invasive (pneumonia, fungemia) disease.  Invasive Candida infections are generally diagnosed by blood culture or biopsy with histopathology, not urine antigen testing. $#(Choice D)#  Cryptococcus neoformans is a yeast with a thick, antiphagocytic, polysaccharide capsule that primarily causes infections in those who are immunocompromised (particularly patients with advanced AIDS).  Although pulmonary infection can occur, disseminated disease is usually marked by meningoencephalitis (eg, headache, confusion, altered mental state). $#(Choice E)#  Malassezia is a dimorphic fungus that is part of normal skin flora.  Conversion from yeast form to the pathogenic mycelial form results in tinea versicolor, which is associated with the characteristic spaghetti and meatballs appearance on microscopy (ie, both hyphae and yeasts seen). $#Educational objective#Tumor necrosis factor–alpha inhibitors are associated with impairments to the cell-mediated immune response and increase the risk of infection with intracellular bacteria and granulomatous fungi (eg, Histoplasma capsulatum).

Four major Plasmodium species cause malaria (Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale, Plasmodium malariae), but most cases worldwide are due to P falciparum or P vivax.  In #Brazil#, the dominant strain is #P vivax# (~90%). $Although the overall life cycle of malaria is relatively preserved across species, P vivax and P ovale have a unique feature not seen in the other strains: They undergo a #dormant hepatic phase# (hypnozoite stage) that may cause #recurrent parasitemia# weeks or months after initial symptoms.  Manifestations of recurrence resemble those of initial disease; most patients develop high fever, #flu-like symptoms# (eg, myalgia, fatigue, headache, chills), and splenomegaly.

The diagnosis is confirmed when @trophozoites@ (intraerythrocytic, ringed inclusions) are seen on peripheral blood smear using Giemsa stain. $Although P falciparum can be treated with an agent that targets only the intraerythrocytic phase of infection, P vivax and P ovale must be treated with a #combination of drugs# that targets the intraerythrocytic phase (eg, chloroquine) and the dormant hepatic phase (eg, primaquine) to ensure clearance.

  "explanation_2": "This patient has #bloody diarrhea# due to Escherichia coli, with enzyme immunoassay detecting a substance capable of inhibiting protein synthesis in human cells.  These findings are characteristic of #Shiga toxin# produced by Shiga toxin–producing E coli, or #enterohemorrhagic E coli#. $E coli and Shigella species are closely related genetically, and Shiga toxin is also produced by #Shigella dysenteriae#.  Shiga toxin is an AB cytotoxin with an active (A) subunit and 5 binding (B) subunits: $• The B subunits, which form pentamers with a central pore, recognize specific receptors on target cells and induce receptor-mediated endocytosis and toxin internalization. $• The enzymatically active A subunit is then released and catalyzes the removal of a specific adenine residue in the #60S ribosomal subunit#, thereby preventing transfer RNA from binding to the ribosome complex and #inhibiting protein synthesis#. $This leads to intestinal mucosal #cell death# (bloody diarrhea) and, with hematogenous spread, toxicity to renal epithelial cells (hemolytic uremic syndrome). $#(Choice A)#  Clostridioides difficile produces toxin A (enterotoxin) and toxin B (cytotoxin).  In contrast to Shiga toxin, toxin A primarily initiates an inflammatory response, whereas toxin B depolymerizes actin filaments, causing gastrointestinal mucosal cell death. $#(Choice B)#  Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces exotoxin A, which is similar in function to diphtheria toxin in that it halts human cellular protein synthesis by inhibiting elongation factor 2.  Although Shiga toxin also disrupts protein synthesis, it does so via a different mechanism (inhibition of the 60S ribosomal subunit). $#(Choice C)#  Salmonella typhi causes typhoid fever, which is characterized by fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea and/or constipation, and faintly erythematous macules on the abdomen (rose spots).  The bacterium penetrates the intestinal mucosa and releases typhoid toxin (not Shiga toxin), which damages cellular DNA. $#(Choice E)#  Staphylococcus aureus typically causes a vomiting-predominant foodborne illness with or without watery diarrhea due to a preformed toxin.  Unlike Shiga toxin, this enterotoxin is not cytotoxic. $#(Choice F)#  Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of cholera, produces choleragen, which acts similarly to the heat-labile toxin of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli.  It increases intracellular cyclic AMP in intestinal mucosal cells, leading to decreased absorption and increased secretion of sodium, chloride, and water. $#Educational objective# Shiga toxin is produced by enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli and Shigella dysenteriae.  It inhibits the 60S ribosomal subunit in human cells, blocking protein synthesis and causing cell death.  "

India ink staining of cerebrospinal fluid reveals the classic encapsulated yeast of Cryptococcus neoformans. $#(Choice D)#  Ophthalmoscopy is useful for the diagnosis of Candida endophthalmitis, which typically presents with impaired visual acuity. $#(Choices E and F)#  Serologic testing is important in the diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), where increased titers of IgE and antibodies to Aspergillus fumigatus are seen.  Skin hypersensitivity testing is also useful.

Transmission occurs via contaminated, large-particle droplets.  Therefore, patients who are hospitalized with influenza generally require droplet precautions (mask and gown for health care providers), and close contacts should be advised to practice appropriate hand hygiene. $#Alcohol-based disinfectants#, which are composed of ethyl or isopropyl alcohol (at concentrations of 60%-90%) in water, are often used for hand hygiene.

Nonenveloped viruses such as adenovirus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, and poliovirus are less susceptible to some alcohol-based disinfectants (particularly isopropyl-based solutions) because they do not have a lipid bilayer envelope. $#(Choice B)#  Proteins (and spores) are sterilized by moist heat (eg, autoclave), which results in protein denaturation.  Although proteins are somewhat susceptible to alcohol-based disinfectants, high concentrations must be used and efficacy is variable.  Alcohol has the strongest effect on lipophilic membranes. $#(Choice C)#  RNA can be rendered inert by ionizing radiation, which dislodges electrons and results in the formation of reactive ions that break covalent bonds.  Alcohol has a minimal effect on RNA molecule integrity. $#(Choice D)#  Neuraminidase, 1 of the 2 influenza surface glycoproteins, can be blocked by neuraminidase inhibitors (eg, oseltamivir, zanamivir).  These are often used to treat acute influenza (prevent the virus from leaving infected cells). $#(Choice E)#  The M2 ion channel mediates fusion of the influenza envelope with the endosome membrane, which liberates the influenza nucleocapsid and enzymes into the cytoplasm of the host cells.  Blockade of the M2 ion channel with amantadine can prevent influenza infection.  However, because influenza virus has developed widespread resistance to M2 ion channel inhibitors, these drugs are not recommended for use in the United States. $#Educational objective# Alcohol-based disinfectants kill enveloped viruses (eg, influenza) by dissolving their outer lipid envelope.

P fimbriae allow uropathogenic E coli to ascend into the bladder, ureters, and kidneys, leading to cystitis and pyelonephritis. $#(Choice A)#  The K1 capsular antigen promotes bloodstream survival of E coli because its sialic acid composition is similar to human cells (ie, molecular mimicry), which helps prevent phagocytosis and facilitates invasive infections.

Influenza strains that are unable to infect humans (eg, avian/swine influenza) encode for hemagglutinin that cannot bind to human cells. $However, influenza is prone to #antigenic changes# in its surface glycoproteins due to: $• Poor proofreading of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which results in the introduction of genetic mutations during replication (antigenic drift). $• Reassortment of the segmented genome when 2 influenza viruses infect the same cell, which results in dramatic alterations to the genome (antigenic shift). $Antigenic changes to hemagglutinin can alter the #tissue tropism# of the virus and allow strains that previously only affected livestock (eg, avian, swine) to infect human cells. $#(Choice B)#  The influenza lipid bilayer envelope is generated from host cells during viral replication.

Many viruses bind to normal host cell plasma membrane receptors to enter host cells. $#Epstein-Barr virus# (EBV) is a herpesvirus responsible for acute infectious mononucleosis, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and certain lymphomas (eg, Burkitt lymphoma).  More than 90% of the normal adult population is seropositive for EBV, which is primarily transmitted through contact with oropharyngeal secretions.  The EBV envelope glycoprotein gp350 binds to #CD21# (also known as CR2), the cellular receptor for the C3d complement component.  CD21 is normally present on the surface of #B cells# (CD19-positive cells) and nasopharyngeal epithelial cells.  Therefore, exposure to a monoclonal anti-CD21 antibody could interfere with EBV attachment to B cells. $#(Choice A)#  Adenovirus has hexon and penton capsomeres on its surface.  Rodlike structures (\"fibers\") that project from the penton base capsomeres are responsible for mediating adsorption to host cells.

  "explanation_2": "$#Influenza viruses (orthomyxoviruses)# are respiratory pathogens that can affect several species, including #humans, birds, and swine#.  They possess the surface proteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), which are virulence factors required for infectivity.  These proteins are also targets of the immune system, and neutralizing antibodies against them can confer immunity to specific influenza strains.  As such, HA and NA are under constant selective pressure both to maintain species-specific virulence and evade immune recognition. $Orthomyxoviruses contain a #segmented# genome, and HA and NA are coded by separate RNA segments.  This allows for #genetic reassortment# when 2 distinct strains infect the same cell.  For instance, avian coinfection with a human influenza A virus (which can also infect birds, the reservoir species for all influenza A subtypes) and an animal influenza A virus can lead to the human-type HA and the animal-type NA being packaged together into the same virion.  This has the potential to create a #novel strain# of virus to which #humans are susceptible# but have #no immunologic resistance#.  This phenomenon is known as antigenic shift, and is responsible for the majority of pandemics and epidemics of influenza A. $#(Choice A)#  Antigenic drift refers to point mutations in HA and NA genes that slightly alter the product proteins, allowing them to evade immune recognition and possibly increasing infectivity of the virus.  However, a change in species-to-species transmission likely represents a major modification in protein structure that is better explained by RNA segment reassortment. $#(Choice B)#  In genetics, complementation occurs when 2 different strains of a mutant organism are able to produce wild-type offspring.  Typically, both parents have homozygous mutations in different genes within the same metabolic pathway.  When they are crossed, the offspring inherits 1 normal allele from each parent, allowing them to bypass both of the metabolic blockades and display the wild-type phenotype. $#(Choice C)#  Frameshift mutations result when a number of bases that are #not# a multiple of 3 are added to or deleted from the coding region of a gene.  This typically results in premature termination of translation and a truncated protein containing the wrong amino acids. $#(Choice E)#  @Phenotypic mixing@ occurs when 2 viruses infect the same cell and progeny viruses exhibit coat or envelope proteins not coded for by the genetic material packaged within them.  However, subsequent progeny express only the proteins encoded by their genome.  The above scenario is not an example of phenotypic mixing as human-to-human transmission was sustained. $#Educational objective# Influenza epidemics and pandemics are typically caused by reassortment of the RNA segments coding for hemagglutinin or neuraminidase proteins (major antigenic shifts).  This process can occur between human and animal strains of influenza A virus in avian or swine hosts.  ",

  "explanation_2": "$#Hepatitis C virus# (HCV) has 6 or more genotypes and multiple subtypes that differ in genomic composition by as much as 30%-35%.  This is largely due to the fact that the virion-encoded #RNA-dependent RNA polymerase# has #no proofreading# 3' → 5' exonuclease activity, which results in many errors during replication. $Although most patients are infected with a single genotype, the high mutation rate leads to the development of distinct quasispecies within infected individuals over time.  These variant strains differ primarily at #hypervariable genomic regions#, such as those found in the sequences coding for its #envelope glycoproteins#.  The continuous generation of novel envelope glycoproteins prevents infected individuals from mounting an effective immune response.  As production of host antibodies against a quasispecies commences, that strain dies off and new ones take its place.  The tremendous antigenic variety of HCV has significantly slowed efforts to develop an effective vaccine. $#(Choices A and B)#  The envelope proteins of HCV are not lost after recurrent viral replication nor are they sequestered within hepatocytes.  These proteins are necessary for viral infectivity as they mediate membrane adhesion and fusion with host hepatocytes. $#(Choice C)#  Like most foreign (nonself) proteins, the envelope proteins of HCV are highly immunogenic. $#(Choice E)#  Host antibodies against HCV have neutralizing properties and are effective in eliminating more established hepatitis C quasispecies.  It is the constantly emerging mutant strains that pose the greatest challenge to the host immune system. $#Educational objective# Genetic variations created during hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication result in marked variety in the antigenic structure of HCV envelope proteins.  The production of host antibodies lags behind that of new mutant HCV strains, preventing infected individuals from mounting an effective immune response.  "

  "explanation_2": "#Staphylococcus epidermidis# is a low-virulence skin commensal that rarely causes infection in healthy patients.  However, those with prosthetic devices (eg, indwelling catheters, #artificial heart valves#, artificial joints) are at risk because the pathogen produces adhesion and biofilm proteins that allow it to grow on artificial surfaces.  S epidermidis is one of the most common contaminants of blood cultures, but infection should be suspected when multiple blood cultures grow the bacteria and/or the patient has symptoms of clinical infection such as fever, malaise, and leukocytosis. $Staphylococcus species are gram-positive cocci that grow in @grape-like clusters@.  They are differentiated from streptococci by the catalase test: Streptococci are catalase-negative whereas staphylococci are #catalase-positive (choice C).#  Further speciation of staphylococci leverages the coagulase test (the ability to clot blood plasma), which differentiates S aureus from #coagulase-negative staphylococci# such as S epidermidis, S haemolyticus, and S saprophyticus. $#(Choice A)#  Alpha hemolysis (partial, green hemolysis when plated on blood agar) is a feature of viridans streptococci, a common cause of infective endocarditis.  Staphylococci species are either beta-hemolytic (complete hemolysis) or gamma-hemolytic (no hemolysis).  S epidermidis is gamma-hemolytic. $#(Choice B)#  S aureus and S haemolyticus can ferment mannitol, but S epidermidis cannot. $#(Choice E)#  Novobiocin is an antibiotic that can be applied to plated colonies to differentiate S saprophyticus from other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species: S saprophyticus is novobiocin-resistant whereas others, such as S epidermidis, are novobiocin-sensitive. $#(Choice F)#  S aureus produces a golden-yellow surface pigment, which accounts for its name (aureus means gold in Latin).  S aureus is a common cause of infective endocarditis and osteomyelitis, particularly in intravenous drug users. $#Educational objective# Staphylococcus epidermidis, a gram-positive coccus that grows in clusters, is a skin commensal that is a common cause of infection in patients with prosthetic devices such as artificial joints or heart valves.  Unlike S aureus, S epidermidis is coagulase-negative.  Unlike S saprophyticus (another coagulase-negative staphylococci species), S epidermidis is susceptible to novobiocin.  ",
