The liver is the major site of drug biotransformation and metabolism, but some drugs are also predominately eliminated by the liver into the bile and feces.  Drugs with high intrinsic hepatic clearance tend to have high lipophilicity and a high volume of distribution.  Highly lipophilic drugs tend to be poorly eliminated in the kidney as these agents rapidly cross tubular cell membranes after filtration to reenter the tissues. $High lipophilicity (lipid solubility) allows the drug to cross cellular barriers more easily and enter hepatocytes.  It can then be excreted in the bile or through other methods of elimination.  In addition, high lipid solubility assures a wide distribution to many different tissues including the brain, liver, and adipose tissue. $#(Choice A)# Drugs with a low distribution volume tend to be confined to the bloodstream and tend not to diffuse readily through hepatocytes into the bile.  Thus, a drug with a low Vd will be highly plasma protein-bound and hydrophilic, making it less available for hepatic metabolism and more readily available for excretion unchanged in the urine. $#(Choice B)# A drug that is not well absorbed orally may have a high pre-systemic (first-pass) elimination or be poorly lipid-soluble.  In both cases, it will be unavailable to the liver for hepatic clearance. $#(Choice D)# A low rate of redistribution from one compartment to another implies low lipid solubility or significant hydrophilicity.  These drugs tend to remain in the intravascular compartment and be eliminated by the kidneys. $#(Choice E)# Poor central nervous system penetration indicates that a drug is likely not lipophilic, and therefore has a low volume of distribution.  It is therefore also unlikely that the same drug will be eliminated in large amounts by the liver. $#Educational objective# While the kidney is the primary site of elimination of most drugs, the liver is the main site of biotransformation of these agents in preparation for elimination.  Drugs that are more lipophilic (high Vd, good penetration into CNS)  are preferentially processed by the liver into more polar compounds for easier elimination in the bile and urine.  Liver disease (e.g., cirrhosis) or the concomitant use of other drugs may limit or enhance the clearance of drugs metabolized in the liver.  ",

Although fixed drug dosing is convenient for providers and patients, dosing based on #body weight# (eg, mg/kg) is often used to improve safety and efficacy, particularly for medications with a narrow therapeutic window (eg, heparins, aminoglycosides, anesthetics). $Body weight affects both the rate of drug clearance and the volume of distribution.  Drug clearance rates correlate closely with lean body weight (ie, the weight of all nonadipose tissues, including muscle, liver, kidneys).  Likewise, the volume of distribution for most drugs also gets larger as lean body mass increases.  However, #obesity# causes a #disproportional increase in adipose mass#, which can have a variable effect on the volume of distribution depending on the solubility of the drug (eg, hydrophilic, hydrophobic). $#Aminoglycosides# are large, charged molecules that cannot cross cell membranes; their volume of distribution is limited to the extracellular space, which increases only marginally in obese individuals.

Furthermore, aminoglycosides are not metabolized by the liver; they are freely filtered by the glomerulus and excreted unchanged in the urine. $#(Choice C)#  The vast majority of drugs, including aminoglycosides, undergo first- (not zero-) order metabolism.  In addition, body weight adjustments with regard to medication dosing are usually made according to the way a drug distributes within the body's tissues. $#(Choice D)#  Acidic drugs with a high degree of plasma protein binding (eg, warfarin) are retained in the intravascular space and have a limited volume of distribution that is less affected by body weight.  In contrast, aminoglycosides have minimal plasma protein binding and can distribute extensively into the interstitial compartment. $#(Choice E)#  Lipophilic drugs partition extensively into adipose tissues; their volume of distribution is better correlated with total body weight than with lean or adjusted body weight.  Highly lipophilic drugs (eg, phenytoin) are tightly sequestered within adipose tissue and often require an initial loading dose to saturate fat stores and achieve adequate serum levels. $#Educational objective# Many drugs are dosed based on total body weight to improve safety and efficacy.

  "explanation_2": "Antagonists are agents that bind to but do not activate receptors.  Antagonists can be either competitive or noncompetitive.  Competitive antagonists bind to the exact same receptor binding sites as endogenous or exogenous agonists, thereby preventing agonist binding and activation of the receptor.  Competitive antagonism can be reversible (ionic bond) or irreversible (covalent bond).  The effect of a reversible competitive antagonist can be overcome by high concentrations of agonist, which cause displacement of the antagonist from the receptors by mass action. $Noncompetitive antagonists, on the other hand, bind to receptors at a site other than the primary agonist binding site, thereby causing a conformational (allosteric) change in the receptor protein that modifies the agonist binding site and prevents agonist binding.  By binding to a different site than the agonist, noncompetitive antagonists are able to remain bound to the receptor even when high concentrations of agonist are present because the agonist is unable to displace noncompetitive antagonists from the receptor.  $The question has asked how the curve for bethanechol #(Curve A)# would be affected by the introduction of a reversible competitive antagonist.  A reversible competitive antagonist is expected to require higher doses of the full agonist (bethanechol) to be present to achieve the same effect at each point along the curve.  If enough of the original substrate is added, the reaction can still reach the same maximum effect.  Thus, the log dose-response curve for a full agonist combined with a reversible competitive antagonist will exhibit a parallel shift to the right in the log-dose response curve, with an increase in the ED₅₀ and no change in the maximum effect (𝐄max). $#(Choice A)# Curve A is the dose-response curve for the original agonist drug in the absence of modifiers such as antagonists. $#(Choices B and C)# Both Curves B and C represent the effect of adding a noncompetitive antagonist to the agonist.  Note that the ED₅₀ is unchanged (i.e. the ED₅₀ for Curves A, B and C occur at the exact same log drug concentration).  This is a distinguishing characteristic of noncompetitive antagonism.  The maximum effect (𝐄max) of Curves B and C are reduced because the noncompetitive antagonist has effectively reduced the number of receptors available for binding.  The decrease in 𝐄max will depend on the dose of noncompetitive antagonist present and is illustrated by the difference between Curves B and C, where a higher concentration of antagonist is present in Curve C than in Curve B. $#(Choice D)# Curve D illustrates a rightward shift in the dose-response relationship, but the shift is not a parallel shift because the shape of the curve differs from that of Curve A, with changes in both 𝐄max and ED₅₀.  This curve is not characteristic of any single antagonist effect and may be the result of adding multiple types of antagonists. $#Educational objective# The changes in the log dose-response curve expected for the effect of a reversible competitive antagonist added to a full agonist are: 1) a parallel shift to the right in the log-dose response curve, illustrating an increase in the ED₅₀, and 2) no change in the maximum effect (𝐄max).  $* Competitive=change ED₅₀=shift right; noncompetitive=change 𝐄max=shift down.

After 5 half-life intervals, a drug is almost completely eliminated from the body.  A drug's half-life depends on 2 pharmacokinetic properties: $• #Clearance (CL)# represents the volume of plasma completely cleared of a substance per unit time (eg, mL/min).  The CL rate is constant for most drugs and depends on the particular metabolic conversion (eg, glucuronidation to inactive form) and/or elimination pathways (eg, biliary or urinary excretion) used to remove the drug from the body.  Increased glucuronidation or glomerular filtration would increase plasma CL of the drug, leading to decreased drug half-life #(choices A and B)#. $• #Volume of distribution (Vd)# refers to the extent to which a drug distributes in body tissue compared to its plasma concentration.  A drug's Vd is determined by its intrinsic properties (eg, lipid solubility, protein binding), as well as patient factors such as body weight and composition (eg, increased fat vs lean mass).  In general, a #higher Vd# means that the drug is increasingly bound to body tissues with a smaller proportion found in the plasma.

  "explanation_2": "This patient has #upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage#, which is likely an #adverse effect# of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (#NSAID#) he has been taking.  Cyclooxygenase (COX) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins, prostacyclin, and thromboxane.  COX enzymes are involved in mediating inflammation but are also required for @housekeeping functions@ such as platelet aggregation, renal protection, and gastric mucosal protection.  Inhibition of COX enzymes by NSAIDs (eg, naproxen, ibuprofen) leads to #impaired# prostaglandin-dependent #gastric mucosal protection# and the potential development of gastritis (ie, erythema, erosions) and ulceration.  Changes to the gastric mucosa may be seen within the first week of initiating NSAID therapy. $Most adverse drug reactions are #predictable# due to the #known pharmacologic properties# of the drug, and often occur after extended drug exposure.  Unpredictable reactions are less common and occur due to relatively patient-specific immunologic processes or other mechanisms (eg, genetic enzyme deficiencies).  In this case, upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to an NSAID is a well-known and predictable adverse effect. $#(Choice A)#  Exaggerated drug sensitivity, also sometimes called drug intolerance, refers to an unpredictable reaction that occurs due to a known pharmacologic action of the drug but at a lower dose than expected (likely due to patient-specific alterations in metabolism or end-organ susceptibility).  For example, patients with deficiency of thiopurine methyltransferase, an enzyme that metabolizes @azathioprine@, are more likely to experience azathioprine intolerance. $#(Choice B)#  An idiosyncratic drug reaction is an unpredictable reaction (ie, results from patient-specific complexities) that does not involve a typical pharmacologic action of the drug.  For example, the use of the antibiotic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency can lead to oxidative cellular injury and nonimmune hemolytic anemia. $#(Choice C)#  Immunologic drug reactions (drug allergies) are unpredictable antibody-or T cell-mediated responses to medications.  This patient's history of rash and pruritus with penicillin likely represents IgE-mediated type I hypersensitivity. $#(Choice E)#  Pseudoallergic drug reactions mimic immunologic reactions but occur via a nonimmunologic mechanism (eg, direct immune cell activation) in those with patient-specific susceptibility.  Vancomycin, opioids, and radioiodine contrast can directly activate mast cells to cause a pseudoallergic reaction that closely mimics IgE-mediated type I hypersensitivity. $#Educational objective# Most adverse drug reactions are predictable and result from known pharmacologic properties of the drug.  Unpredictable reactions are less common and are typically driven by patient-specific genetics (eg, enzyme deficiency) or immunologic mechanisms.  ",

Because average serum levels are relatively equal between the 2 groups, it is likely that the adjuvant improves the efficacy of Drug X by increasing its ability to penetrate the #blood-brain barrier# (BBB). $Many drugs have a difficult time crossing the BBB due to the presence of specialized endothelial cells with very #tight intercellular junctions# that form a #physical barrier# separating the CNS from the circulation.  In addition, multidrug transport proteins, particularly #p-glycoprotein#, are highly expressed on the luminal membrane of brain capillary endothelial cells.  P-glycoprotein is an ATP-driven #efflux pump# that actively #removes a wide range of substrates# from cells, including many commonly prescribed drugs (eg, antibiotics, immunosuppressant agents, HIV protease inhibitors). $In HIV infection, poor penetration of antiretroviral medications allows the brain to act as an anatomical sanctuary where viral replication can proceed unchecked, facilitating the development of resistant strains.  Methods of bypassing the BBB (eg, disruption of tight junctions, #p-glycoprotein inhibition#) can #improve drug delivery# to the CNS.  P-glycoprotein transporters are also found on the apical surface of enterocytes and can limit drug bioavailability by pumping the drug back into the intestinal lumen.  However, inhibition of p-glycoprotein can have a #variable effect on serum drug levels#, as increased bioavailability is often countered by increased drug distribution (eg, into the CSF or intracellular compartments). $#(Choices A, B, and E)#  Reduced drug metabolism or decreased excretion could potentially improve drug efficacy by increasing average serum drug levels.  However, in this experiment, serum drug levels increased by only 10 ng/ml (~2%) with coadministration of the adjuvant.  This minimal increase in drug concentration is not representative of a significant change in drug metabolic/clearance parameters and is unlikely to lead to increased BBB penetration. $#(Choice C)#  The choroid plexus is the site of CSF production and can function as an alternate entryway into the CNS.

This leads to #anticholinergic# effects (eg, fever, urinary retention, decreased sweating, altered mental status).  In this patient, the flushing is likely a compensatory response to dissipate excess body heat due to decreased sweating, and the pupillary dilation is due to inhibition of the iris sphincter. $Although commonly described as H1 receptor antagonists, antihistamines are actually inverse agonists that stabilize the receptor in the inactive state.  H1 receptors are found in the vascular endothelium and bronchial smooth muscle, where they mediate vascular permeability and bronchoconstriction, as well as in the central nervous system where they are involved in alertness.  Antihistaminic effects relieve nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing, and itching.  First-generation antihistamines cross the blood-brain barrier and cause sedation.  By contrast, second-generation antihistamines (eg, loratadine) are more specific to the histamine H1 receptor and have less permeability through the blood-brain barrier; they are generally less effective than first-generation antihistamines but have significantly fewer side effects. $#(Choice A)#  Flushing and mydriasis are due to antagonism of the cholinergic receptor, not the H1 receptor. $#(Choice B)#  H2 receptors are found on parietal cells in the gastric mucosa.  H2 antagonists block gastric acid secretion by parietal cells. $#(Choice D)#  Nicotinic cholinergic receptors are found in sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia and on skeletal muscle cells at the neuromuscular junction.  Nicotinic receptor antagonists (eg, rocuronium) are used to induce paralysis in preparation for surgery or endotracheal intubation.  Adverse effects include hemodynamic instability (eg, hypotension) and respiratory insufficiency. $#(Choice E)#  Alpha-1 adrenoreceptors are located on smooth muscle and neurons.  Activation of these receptors increases smooth muscle tone of the iris dilator (causing mydriasis) and blood vessels (causing vasoconstriction); alpha-1 adrenergic agonists (eg, phenylephrine, oxymetazoline) can be used in patients with allergic rhinitis because their vasoconstrictive action reduces nasal congestion.  However, vasoconstriction inhibits flushing. $#Educational objective# First-generation antihistamines are nonspecific and interact with multiple receptors, including the muscarinic receptor.

  "explanation_2": "The volume of distribution (Vd) refers to a hypothetical volume of fluid into which the administered amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the observed plasma concentration.  The volume of distribution is determined by administering a given amount of drug by the intravenous route and subsequently measuring the initial plasma concentration of the drug.  The formula is as follows: $#\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003Vd (L) = amount of drug given (mg) / plasma concentration of drug (mg/L)# $The average total body water is approximately 41 liters.  Of that, the extracellular fluid volume is about 14 L, or 1/3 of total body water.  Within the extracellular fluid, the plasma volume is about 3 L, and interstitial fluid makes up the rest.  Initially, the drug enters the plasma compartment by the IV route.  If a drug has a large molecular weight, is bound extensively to plasma proteins, or is highly charged (hydrophilic), then the drug generally remains in the plasma compartment and the volume of distribution is usually low as in the case above (about 3-5 liters).  If the drug has a small molecular weight but is hydrophilic, it can distribute into the interstitial fluid compartment outside of the blood vessels as well as in the intravascular compartment.  In these cases the volume of distribution is limited to a total volume of about 14-16 liters (plasma volume plus interstitial volume).  If the drug has a small molecular weight and is also uncharged (hydrophobic or lipophilic), then the drug can cross cell membranes and reach intracellular compartment.  These drugs have the highest volume of distribution (41 liters).  Drugs that are avidly bound in the tissues exhibit the highest volumes of distribution, often much higher than the total body water volume, because these drugs accumulate readily within cells thereby maintaining low plasma concentrations. $#(Choice A)# If the molecular weight of the drug is low, then the drug will tend to easily pass through endothelial junctions into the interstitial fluid, making the volume of distribution at least 14 liters.  The Vd may be higher if the drug is also hydrophobic. $#(Choice B)# Lipophilic drugs tend to readily cross cell membranes and distribute widely outside the plasma and interstitial compartments.  This tendency to collect within cells gives these drugs a high volume of distribution. $#(Choice C)# A drug with a Vd of 4.5 L, which is approximately the same as the plasma volume, is likely to be highly bound to plasma proteins such as albumin.  Binding to plasma proteins tends to retain drug in the plasma compartment and prevent the diffusion of drug into the extravascular compartments.  If this drug were not bound to albumin, it would be more likely to diffuse into the interstitium and a higher Vd would be expected. $#(Choice E)# Bioavailability is a measure of absorption and is unrelated to the distribution of a drug. $#Educational objective# Characteristics of a drug such as high molecular weight, high plasma protein binding, high charge, and hydrophilicity tend to trap the drug in the plasma compartment resulting in a low Vd (3-5 L).

  "explanation_2": "#Atropine# is an anticholinergic medication that can be administered prior to bronchoscopy to decrease respiratory mucus secretions and promote bronchodilation.  #Anticholinergic# drugs competitively inhibit the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor both centrally (leading to delirium, coma, and respiratory failure) and peripherally (see toxidrome in table).  The elderly are at particularly high risk of developing anticholinergic toxicity, likely due to decreased renal and hepatic clearance. $#Cholinesterase inhibitors# overcome this toxicity by inhibiting the degradation of acetylcholine, thereby increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at the synaptic cleft.  Central nervous system (CNS) penetration and reversal of central symptoms are dependent on chemical structure: $• #Tertiary amines# (eg, #physostigmine#, galantamine, donepezil, rivastigmine) are lipophilic (nonpolar) and can easily cross the blood-brain barrier to reverse both central and peripheral symptoms. $• Quaternary amines (eg, neostigmine, edrophonium, pyridostigmine) are hydrophilic (polarized) and do not readily cross the blood-brain barrier.  These drugs reverse peripheral symptoms only #(choices B and D)#. $#(Choices A and C)#  Both diazepam and haloperidol can be used for sedation or cases of severe agitation.  Haloperidol is an antipsychotic that blocks dopamine receptors in the CNS, and diazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine that positively modulates GABA-A activity.  Neither medication reverses the peripheral anticholinergic manifestations (eg, mydriasis, tachycardia). $#Educational objective# Physostigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor with a tertiary ammonium structure that can reverse both the central and peripheral nervous system symptoms of anticholinergic toxicity.  Neostigmine, edrophonium, and pyridostigmine have a quaternary ammonium structure that limits central nervous system penetration.  "

These slight interpersonal variations in the ability to metabolize drugs are typically reflected graphically by a unimodal distribution, usually in the shape of a bell curve, when plasma levels of drug are measured at a fixed time following a fixed dose of drug.  This is the method that was used to generate the graph given in the question stem.  With most drugs, the majority of people fall within one standard deviation and 95% of people fall within two standard deviations of the population mean of plasma concentration.  A single peak in this type of graph indicates that the population being tested possesses a similar genetic drug metabolizing capacity. $A bimodal (discontinuous, polymorphic) curve, as shown in the question stem, results from the presence of two apparently distinct groups within the study population and suggests a pharmacogenetic polymorphism in drug metabolizing capacity.  In other words, the two peaks indicate two sets of responders to the drug within the population: one that rapidly converts the drug into its metabolite (considered normals) and another that converts the drug slowly, leading to accumulation of the original drug in the plasma. $Isoniazid is metabolized by acetylation to N-acetyl-isoniazid in the hepatic microsomal system by the enzyme N-acetyl transferase and is subsequently excreted in the urine.  The first and second peaks in the above graph represent fast and slow acetylators, respectively.  Slow acetylators of isoniazid also metabolize (acetylate) dapsone, hydralazine, and procainamide slowly, causing accumulation of these drugs as well.  Slow acetylators of these drugs are at increased risk of toxic effects, while fast acetylators may require much higher therapeutic doses to achieve a therapeutic effect. $#(Choice A)# Methylation is an important drug biotransformation method to consider when prescribing drugs such as azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine, drugs used in the treatment of some inflammatory disorders of the bowel and skin. $#(Choice B)# Glucuronidation is a biotransformation pathway utilized for the metabolism of numerous drugs as well as endogenous substances such as bilirubin.  No bimodality has been described with this pathway, but conditions such as Gilbert syndrome involve dysfunction of the glucuronyl transferase system that can lead to toxic accumulation of some drugs. $#(Choice C)# Hydrolysis occurs with enzymes such as esterases and amidases.  Isoniazid is not metabolized by this pathway, and hydrolysis does not exhibit polymorphic metabolism. $#(Choice E)# Amine oxidation is usually undertaken by monoamine oxidases or by cytochrome oxidative deamination.  Neither process metabolizes isoniazid nor exhibits bimodality. $#Educational objective #Isoniazid is metabolized by acetylation.  The speed with which a patient is able to acetylate drugs depends on whether they are genetically \"fast\" or \"slow\" acetylators.

Reduced hepatic blood flow also results in decreased drug delivery to the liver, further impairing hepatic drug metabolism and clearance.  However, metformin is not metabolized by the liver; it is excreted unchanged by the kidney. $#(Choice C)#  Decreased tissue perfusion in heart failure typically leads to a reduced volume of distribution of most drugs.

For a drug that is inactivated by first-pass metabolism, the rectal route allows a higher proportion of the drug to bypass portal circulation, increasing bioavailability. $#(Choices B, C, and D)#  For orally administered drugs, the small intestine is a major site of absorption owing to its large surface area and high blood flow rates.  In contrast, the rectum has a much smaller surface area, lower blood flow rates, and often contains absorptive stool.  Therefore, rectally administered drugs are typically absorbed more slowly and erratically compared to orally administered drugs. $#(Choice E)#  Reduced renal blood flow causes a decrease in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which in turn slows elimination of renally excreted drugs (ie, increases bioavailability).

  "explanation_2": "Efficacy and potency are terms that are commonly used and often confused.  In pharmacology, efficacy refers to the intrinsic ability of a drug to elicit an effect, such as receptor activation or dilation of a vessel as described in the question stem.  It is a measure of the maximum ceiling of activity [𝐄max]  of a drug with respect to a particular pharmacodynamic end point.  For example, loop diuretics such as furosemide or bumetanide will cause greater diuresis or natriuresis than any thiazide diuretic, irrespective of dose. $Potency, on the other hand, refers to the dose of drug that is required to produce a given effect.  The potency of a drug is primarily affected by the affinity of the drug for its receptor and the amount of drug that is able to reach the target tissues   Therefore, drugs that bind their receptors with a higher affinity or are better able to gain access to their target tissues will have greater potency.  The potency of different agents can be compared by determining the dose of drug that is required to produce one-half (50%) of the maximum biological response.  This dose is known as the ED₅₀.  The lower the ED₅₀ of a drug, the more potent it is.  For example, among the thiazide diuretics, 25mg of hydrochlorothiazide and 5mg chlorthalidone produce similar drops in blood pressure (similar efficacy), but chlorthalidone requires a lower dose, or lower ED₅₀, than HCTZ to cause a similar effect (higher potency). $With respect to the question, drug 2 and drug 3 have similar maximum effects (efficacy).  A much lower dose of drug 2 is required to produce the same effect as that seen with drug 3; therefore, drug 2 is more potent than drug 3 and has a lower ED₅₀.  To achieve this higher potency, the binding of drug 2 to its receptors (affinity) must be higher than that of drug 3 #(choice B),# or drug 2 must be better able to reach its target (penetration) than drug 3. $#(Choice A)# Drug 1 has higher potency than Drug 2 because at low biological activity, it can cause the same effect with much lower concentrations of drug.  However, it does not reach the same maximum effect as Drug 2. $#(Choice C)# Drug 1 demonstrates the lowest efficacy (ceiling of biological effect) of the three drugs graphed.  Lower efficacy may be a result of partial agonism and other factors.  $#(Choice D)# Drugs 2 and 3 exhibit a parallel shift in their relative biological effects exhibiting similar efficacy but different potency (The shapes of their graphs are identical, but at different dose ranges).  Drug 3 may contain the same basic pharmocologic agent as Drug 2 but with a competitive antagonist mixed in; thus, the 𝐄max is the same but the ED₅₀ is higher.  A competitive antagonist would bind to the same location as the original substance. $#(Choice E)# Drug 2 has a lower ED₅₀ (greater potency) than drug 3.  Both have equal efficacy. $#Educational objective #Efficacy is a measure of the maximum pharmacodynamic effect achievable with a drug.  Potency refers to the dose of drug that is required to produce a given effect.  Drugs that bind their receptors with a higher affinity or are better able to gain access to their target tissues will have greater potency (lower ED₅₀).  "

  "explanation_2": "This patient who took large quantities of a pain medication initially had nausea and vomiting and has now developed scleral icterus, right upper quadrant pain, and markedly elevated aminotransferases.  These findings are consistent with an overdose of #acetaminophen#, a commonly used analgesic. $When taken at appropriate doses, acetaminophen produces small amounts of the #toxic metabolite# @N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI)@, which is conjugated with glutathione in the liver and excreted.  At supratherapeutic doses, glutathione becomes saturated, allowing excessive amounts of NAPQI to form adducts with hepatic proteins that #disrupt hepatocyte mitochondrial function# and cause #oxidative injury#. $Because acetaminophen-induced liver injury primarily affects hepatocytes (ie, #hepatocellular liver injury#), laboratory findings show markedly #elevated aminotransferases# with levels sometimes >1,000 U/L.  Mild elevations of bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase can be seen but may be normal.  Liver biopsy shows centrilobular hepatic necrosis, a common finding in ischemic or toxic liver injury. $#(Choice A)#  Certain drugs (eg, carbamazepine, phenytoin) can trigger a robust CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell response against hepatic proteins, leading to drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS).  Although hepatocellular liver injury can occur, fever, lymphadenopathy, and skin manifestations (eg, facial edema, coalescing erythema) would be expected. $#(Choice B)#  Drug-mediated (eg, ceftriaxone) cholestatic liver injury typically causes biliary duct damage or interrupts the flow of bile.  These patients have markedly elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase (and sometimes bilirubin), and aminotransferase levels are typically normal. $#(Choice D)#  Microvesicular steatohepatitis, or small droplets of intracytoplasmic lipids within hepatocytes, is caused by drugs that disrupt fatty acid beta-oxidation.  Ibuprofen and aspirin are commonly used analgesics that can rarely lead to this condition; however, marked aminotransferase elevations are not seen in ibuprofen toxicity, and aspirin toxicity is usually seen in young children with a recent viral infection (ie, Reye syndrome). $#(Choice E)#  Chronic alcohol consumption can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which activate stellate cells and cause cirrhosis.  Although NAPQI does create ROS, stellate cell activation does not occur, and this patient's acute liver injury after analgesic ingestion makes this diagnosis unlikely. $#Educational objective# Excessive acetaminophen use causes toxicity through its metabolite N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine, which disrupts hepatocyte mitochondrial function and induces oxidative injury throughout the liver.

THF is a single-carbon group donor in the synthesis of purines and thymidylic acid (which contributes to pyrimidine formation).  MTX functions as a chemotherapeutic agent through #inhibition of DNA synthesis# and as an anti-psoriasis agent through immunomodulatory effects on activated T cells.

  "explanation_2": "This patient has muscle tenderness and weakness.  The dark urine suggests #myoglobinuria #due to myocyte necrosis.  In the context of ongoing statin therapy for hyperlipidemia, this presentation likely represents statin myopathy.  Statin myopathy is due, likely at least in part, to decreased myocyte production of coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinone).  Serum muscle breakdown markers (eg, creatine kinase) are often elevated, and severe cases may lead to #rhabdomyolysis #with subsequent #acute kidney injury# (eg, elevated BUN and creatinine). $#Statin myopathy# is most common in the initial weeks or months of therapy.  However, it can occasionally occur later, and can be acutely triggered by medications that increase circulating statin levels.  This patient's myopathy is most likely related to the initiation of clarithromycin as part of a multidrug regimen for Helicobacter pylori. $Statins, primarily simvastatin, lovastatin, and atorvastatin, are metabolized by #CYP3A4#.  This enzyme can be #inhibited by macrolide antibiotics# (eg, erythromycin, clarithromycin), leading to increased statin drug levels and subsequent statin myopathy.  (Azithromycin does not significantly inhibit CYP3A4.)  Other significant CYP3A4 inhibitors that can induce statin myopathy include ketoconazole, non–dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, diltiazem), amiodarone, and protease inhibitors (eg, ritonavir).  Because pravastatin is not primarily metabolized by CYP3A4, patients who must take a CYP3A4 inhibitor may benefit from switching to this drug. $#(Choice A)#  Amoxicillin does not inhibit CYP3A4 or increase circulating simvastatin levels.  Penicillin antibiotics generally have only minor effects on the cytochrome P-450 system. $#(Choice B)#  Bismuth subsalicylate can cause black stools due to the formation of bismuth sulfate in the gastrointestinal tract.  However, this medication does not cause myopathy or myoglobinuria.  Excessive intake of bismuth can cause motor weakness, but this is due primarily to neural rather than muscle toxicity. $#(Choice C)#  Polyvalent cations (eg, calcium, iron) can form insoluble chelate complexes with certain antibiotics (eg, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones) and other drugs (eg, levothyroxine, levodopa), leading to decreased drug absorption.  Simvastatin does not form chelate complexes, and decreased absorption would lower, not increase, the risk for myopathy. $#(Choice E)#  Both metronidazole and simvastatin carry a small risk for peripheral neuropathy.

Proton pump inhibitors can help reduce the risk of upper GI bleeding in patients taking aspirin. $#(Choice A)#  Central nervous system depression is commonly seen with benzodiazepine use as these agents potentiate the effect of GABA (a major inhibitory neurotransmitter) on GABA-A receptors. $#(Choice C)#  Very high doses of aspirin can cause salicylism (eg, vertigo, tinnitus, hearing loss) and hyperpnea (stimulates respiratory drive).  Hyperpnea may result in respiratory alkalosis, whereas systemic salicylate accumulation often leads to a concurrent metabolic acidosis. $#(Choice D)#  Orthostatic hypotension may occur with use of antihypertensive medications due to vasodilation (eg, nitrates, calcium channel blockers) and volume depletion (eg, loop and thiazide diuretics). $#(Choice E)#  Sexual dysfunction is a common side effect of antidepressants (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclics) and some antihypertensives (eg, thiazide diuretics, spironolactone, clonidine). $#(Choice F)#  Pioglitazone (a thiazolidinedione) increases insulin sensitivity in patients with type II diabetes mellitus by binding to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors.  Long-term use may be associated with urinary bladder cancer. $#Educational objective# Gastrointestinal (GI) mucosal injury and bleeding are the most common side effects of aspirin.  These are due primarily to cyclooxygenase-1 inhibition, which results in impaired prostaglandin-dependent GI mucosal defense and decreased platelet aggregation.  "

  "explanation_2": "$The drug under investigation is glucuronated by the liver into water-soluble byproducts that can then be excreted by the kidney.  The graph above shows how the #rate of drug glucuronidation# changes with increasing drug doses.  At lower doses, the quantity of drug-glucuronide formed is directly proportional to the dose administered (ie, as more of the drug is administered, more drug-glucuronide is produced).  Because a #fixed proportion# of drug is converted to the metabolite, this early portion of the graph represents #first-order kinetics#. $As the active sites on glucuronosyltransferase become saturated, the drug-glucuronide rate does not continue to rise with increasing doses of the substrate drug.  At this point (2 on the graph), the kinetics change from first- to #zero-order kinetics# and the graph levels out to a zero slope.  With zero-order kinetics, #a constant amount# of drug is metabolized and eliminated per unit of time regardless of its concentration or dose. $Zero- and first-order kinetics can also be represented graphically by showing the decrease in @drug concentration over time@ after a single dose.  Zero-order metabolism is indicated by a straight line with negative slope (fixed amount eliminated per unit of time), whereas first-order kinetics manifest as an exponential decay curve (fixed proportion eliminated per unit of time). $#(Choice A)#  After point 3, the curve remains flat, indicating that a constant amount of drug is metabolized per unit of time regardless of the dose.  As higher doses are administered, the proportion that is converted to the metabolite becomes smaller (ie, the proportion metabolized is non-constant after point 3). $#(Choice B)#  Bioavailability is the fraction of an administered drug that reaches the systemic circulation unchanged.  It usually decreases with oral administration due to incomplete absorption and first-pass metabolism compared to parenteral administration.  In this case, higher doses of the drug are likely to have greater bioavailability due to the saturation of hepatic metabolism. $#(Choice C)#  At point 2, biotransformation (ie, metabolism) of the drug begins to switch from first-order to zero-order kinetics due to enzyme saturation.  However, drug metabolism does not stop. $#(Choice E)#  Before point 1, drug metabolism proceeds via first-order kinetics.  Therefore, the drug metabolization rate increases as higher doses are administered. $#Educational objective# In first-order kinetics, a constant fraction (or proportion) of drug is metabolized per unit of time, so the amount metabolized changes based on the serum concentration.  In zero-order kinetics, a constant amount of drug is metabolized per unit of time, independent of serum levels.  ",

  "explanation_2": "$Platinum-based chemotherapy agents (eg, cisplatin) are widely used as a first-line treatment for many solid tumors, including non–small cell lung cancer.  These agents disrupt DNA replication and have substantial cytotoxicity against rapidly proliferating cells.  Despite their efficacy in killing tumor cells, their use is limited by severe adverse effects (eg, nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, myelosuppression) that occur due to accumulation within normal tissues (ie, off-target effects). $Methods that provide #targeted delivery# to the tumor site can help #minimize toxicity# and #optimize drug response#.  In this example, cisplatin is encapsulated in liposomes, forming a nanoparticle cage that traps the drug and limits its interaction with normal cells.  The addition of anti–epidermal growth factor receptor #(anti-EGFR) antibodies# on the liposome surface results in an #antibody-drug conjugate#, allowing the encapsulated drug complex to #selectively bind to tumor cells# expressing high levels of EGFR, which is often overexpressed in non–small cell lung cancer.  Once bound, the antibody-drug complex is internalized and degraded, releasing the free drug into the cytoplasm and causing targeted cell death. $#(Choice A)#  Overexpression of drug efflux pumps (eg, P-glycoprotein) by cancer cells is a major cause of chemotherapy resistance.  Efflux pump inhibitors can decrease drug excretion from tumor cells and potentiate the effects of chemotherapeutic agents. $#(Choice B)#  Many cancers create an immunosuppressive microenvironment that prevents the immune system from effectively killing tumor cells.  An enhanced cytotoxic T-cell response against tumor cells occurs with the use of @immune checkpoint inhibitors@ (eg, PD-1 or CTLA-4 receptor inhibitors) that help prevent T-cell exhaustion. $#(Choice C)#  Desmoplasia (ie, reactive growth of fibrous connective tissue) occurs in response to certain tumors (eg, breast, pancreatic carcinoma).  The dense fibrotic tissue acts as a molecular sieve, decreasing the penetration of chemotherapeutic agents.  Chemoresistance is more likely to occur with larger drug complexes; in this case, the new liposomal formulation will be much larger than individual cisplatin molecules, resulting in decreased desmoplastic penetration. $#(Choice D)#  Increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) within tumors stimulates blood vessel growth, facilitating tumor expansion and increasing the potential for metastasis.  Anti-VEGF antibodies (eg, bevacizumab) bind VEGF and inhibit tumor-induced angiogenesis.  Although EGFR stimulation also plays a role in angiogenesis, in this case, the anti-EGFR antibodies are used for targeting purposes and may not necessarily inhibit the EGFR receptor (antibodies can be stimulatory, inhibitory, or have no signaling effect depending on the attachment site). $#Educational objective# Antibody-drug conjugates improve drug efficacy and minimize toxicity by allowing conventional chemotherapeutic agents (eg, cisplatin) to selectively target and kill cancer cells while sparing healthy cells (ie, targeted delivery).

  "explanation_2": "This patient is receiving #chronic opioid therapy# for nonspecific low back pain due to lumbar osteoarthritis.  He reports worsening pain despite an increased drug dose.  No new structural explanation for increased pain was revealed on medical evaluation (ie, unchanged spine imaging and physical examination).  Therefore, the loss of opioid analgesic efficacy is likely due to #drug tolerance#: higher doses of drugs are required to achieve the same clinical effect. $A distinction is drawn between pharmacokinetic versus pharmacodynamic tolerance: $• Pharmacokinetic tolerance (ADME):  The plasma level of the active drug is decreased due to impaired #A#bsorption (eg, short bowel syndrome), increased tissue #D#istribution (eg, plasma protein binding, adiposity), increased #M#etabolism (eg, P450 cytochrome induction), or increased #E#xcretion. $• Pharmacodynamic tolerance:  The plasma level of the active drug is unchanged (ie, normal pharmacokinetics).  However, the action of the drug on target cells is blunted (eg, #receptor downregulation#, decreased intracellular signaling), reducing the overall pharmacologic effect. $In both cases, tolerance can be innate or acquired.  Innate tolerance refers to inborn differences in genes coding for enzymes involved in drug metabolism (pharmacokinetic) or receptor structure/expression (pharmacodynamic).  Innate tolerance is apparent from the first dose, which elicits an unexpectedly weak effect.  This patient experienced a good analgesic response initially, arguing against the presence of innate tolerance #(choice A).# $Acquired tolerance is defined as a decreased pharmacologic response following prolonged drug exposure.  #Acquired pharmacodynamic tolerance# is the primary form of chronic opioid tolerance, characterized by downregulation and decreased responsivity (eg, GRK/beta-arrestin phosphorylation) of the mu opioid receptor system compared to the opioid-naïve state. $#(Choice C)#  The kappa and delta opioid receptors bind to endogenous opioid-like neuropeptides (dynorphin and enkephalins, respectively) to mediate analgesia.  Like mu receptors, they are also downregulated by chronic opioid administration, contributing further to acquired pharmacodynamic tolerance. $#(Choice D)#  In acquired pharmacokinetic tolerance, altered ADME results in lower plasma drug levels.  Higher rates of metabolism (eg, P450 enzyme autoinduction) can accelerate the inactivation/elimination of many medications (eg, methadone, carbamazepine).  However, lower rates of excretion (eg, renal or hepatic insufficiency) would raise the plasma drug concentration, leading to potential overdose rather than tolerance. $#(Choice E)#  Adiposity (eg, increasing obesity) can contribute to pharmacokinetic tolerance by raising the apparent volume of distribution, thereby lowering the plasma drug concentration.  However, equilibration between plasma and extravascular compartments is complete within 5 drug half-lives, occurring long before this patient's development of tolerance after 3 months.  Furthermore, adipose partitioning is primarily a concern for highly lipophilic drugs (eg, fentanyl, not oxycodone). $#Educational objective# Chronic opioid therapy leads to the development of acquired pharmacodynamic tolerance via downregulation and decreased responsiveness of opioid receptor systems.

  "explanation_2": "This patient has #Gaucher disease#, an autosomal recessive condition caused by a #deficiency of lysosomal beta-glucocerebrosidase#.  This deficiency leads to the accumulation of glucocerebroside, a glycolipid component of cell membranes, within the lysosomes of macrophages, giving them the classic appearance of wrinkled tissue paper.  Characteristic symptoms (eg, hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, bone pain) develop as lipid-laden macrophages accumulate in the body's tissues (eg, spleen, liver, and bone). $Lysosomal storage diseases can be treated through the delivery of a #replacement enzyme# into the lysosomes of affected cells; in the case of Gaucher disease, #recombinant glucocerebrosidases# (eg, imiglucerase) are available to replace the deficient enzyme.  Almost all human enzymes, including lysosomal enzymes, are large polypeptides (eg, proteins) #(choice B).#  Although the oral route is often preferred for drug administration, most peptide-based drugs (eg, insulin, immunoglobulins) cannot be efficiently absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract due to the intestinal epithelial barrier and extensive proteolysis that takes place in the stomach and duodenum.  As a result, #large polypeptides# such as a glucocerebrosidase must be #administered intravenously# to achieve adequate circulating levels. $Once in the circulation, exogenous glucocerebrosidase can enter cells by binding to #mannose 6-phosphate receptors#.  These receptors are found in the Golgi network, where they help route newly synthesized lysosomal proteins (tagged by mannose 6-phosphate residues).  They are also expressed #on the cell surface#, where they bind free lysosomal enzymes that are accidentally secreted.  Exogenous glucocerebrosidase can bind to these cell surface receptors, inducing #endocytosis# of the bound enzyme.  It is then carried by endosomes to lysosomes, where it can degrade accumulated glucocerebrosides, reducing disease manifestations. $#(Choices C and D)#  Enzymes are large, polar polypeptides that are unable to effectively cross the cell membrane by passive diffusion.  In contrast, steroid-based drugs are typically hydrophobic and can easily cross cell membranes by passive diffusion.  However, steroidal drugs function by binding to receptors; they do not directly catalyze reactions. $#(Choices E, F, G, and H)#  Unlike in lysosomal storage diseases, enzyme replacement therapy for pancreatic exocrine insufficiency is administered orally because pancreatic digestive enzymes normally function within the gastrointestinal lumen. $#Educational objective# Certain lysosomal storage diseases, including Gaucher disease, can be treated with enzyme-replacement therapy (eg, recombinant glucocerebrosidase).  Because enzymes are large proteins that cannot be orally absorbed, the replacement enzyme must be administered intravenously.  Entry into the cell occurs by endocytosis after the replacement enzyme binds to mannose 6-phosphate receptors on the cell surface.  "

  "explanation_2": "$#Toxoplasma gondii# is a ubiquitous protozoan that rarely causes illness in healthy individuals but can cause severe infection in immunocompromised patients or those with #congenital infection#.  Symptomatic congenital disease is often marked by intracranial calcification, hydrocephalus, chorioretinitis, jaundice, and/or thrombocytopenia.  Early treatment with #sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine# reduces neurologic and retinal sequelae. $Sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine work #synergistically# to #inhibit protozoal DNA synthesis# by blocking 2 steps necessary for the formation of tetrahydrofolate (THF), a cofactor needed for synthesis of #purine nucleic acids#.  Sulfadiazine inhibits #dihydropteroate synthase#, a microbial enzyme that generates dihydropteroate, which is converted to dihydrofolic acid.  Pyrimethamine inhibits #dihydrofolate reductase#, an enzyme that converts dihydrofolic acid to THF. $Sulfadiazine does not impair host DNA synthesis because dihydropteroate synthase is not found in human cells.  In contrast, pyrimethamine partially impairs host DNA synthesis because dihydrofolate reductase generates THF in host cells.  However, #leucovorin# (folinic acid), a derivative of THF that does not require conversion by dihydrofolate reductase, is usually administered with pyrimethamine to provide a bypass substrate for the generation of host purine nucleic acids. $#(Choice A)#  Patients are often treated with 2 different classes of antimicrobial medications to broaden the coverage of potential pathogens.  Sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine both block the same metabolic pathway, so the combination is less useful for empiric antimicrobial therapy. $#(Choice B)#  Gentamicin is often administered with an agent that targets the bacterial cell wall (eg, ampicillin, vancomycin) to allow gentamicin to enter the @intracellular space@.  Use of sulfadiazine with pyrimethamine does not alter intracellular penetration. $#(Choice C)#  Bacterial resistance can occur due to the production of an inactivating enzyme (eg, beta-lactamase).  Administration of an agent that inhibits the enzyme (eg, clavulanic acid) can often restore the effect of the antibiotic (eg, amoxicillin). $#(Choice D)#  Probenecid blocks the renal tubular excretion of most beta-lactam antibiotics, which can increase their serum level.  Sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine are not used together to alter renal excretion. $#Educational objective# Congenital toxoplasmosis is treated with sulfadiazine plus pyrimethamine.  These medications work synergistically to inhibit formation of tetrahydrofolate, a necessary cofactor for purine nucleotide synthesis.  ",

  "explanation_2": "$#Interleukin-2# (IL-2) is a cytokine produced endogenously by #activated CD4 cells#, CD8 cells, and natural killer (NK) cells.  High-dose IL-2 infusions can also be administered to patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma or metastatic melanoma in order to increase #antitumor lymphocyte activity#, as follows: $• #CD4 cells:#  IL-2 converts activated CD4 cells into type 1 T-helper cells, which then secrete inflammatory cytokines (eg, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-2) that drive an antitumor response. $• #CD8 cells:#  IL-2 expands the pool of activated CD8 cells and increases their cytotoxic killing with granzymes and perforins. $• #NK cells:#  IL-2 triggers proliferation of NK cells and #dramatically increases# their #cytotoxic activity#; most of the antitumor effect of IL-2 therapy comes from increased NK cell activity. $Although patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma who undergo IL-2 therapy may enter long-lasting remission, high-dose IL-2 treatment is nonspecific and causes significant adverse effects due to excessive cytokine production (eg, capillary leak syndrome).  Therefore, most patients are now treated with newer immunotherapy agents such as CTLA-4 inhibitors (eg, ipilimumab) or PD-1 protein inhibitors (eg, nivolumab) that deliver more targeted therapy and are better tolerated. $#(Choice A)#  Tumor hypoxia and lactic acid production increase release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which promotes angiogenesis required for tumor growth.  Therefore, anti-VEGF immunotherapy (eg, bevacizumab) can induce a potent antitumor response; it is often used for lung and colorectal cancer. $#(Choice B)#  Although CD8 and NK cells induce cell death via apoptosis, this effect is not mediated by direct binding of IL-2 to the tumor cell.  Certain chemotherapy drugs (eg, etoposide, vincristine, cyclophosphamide) directly induce apoptosis by damaging tumor cell DNA, the cytoskeleton, or mitochondria. $#(Choice C)#  Monoclonal antibodies that target specific cell surface molecules on the tumor can induce tumor cell death via @antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity@.  An example of this type of immunotherapy is alemtuzumab, a drug for chronic lymphocytic leukemia that targets a cell surface receptor (CD52) found primarily on mature lymphocytes.  However, IL-2 does not directly interact with the Fc receptor on cytotoxic cells. $#(Choice E)#  Although IL-2 triggers CD8 cells to increase expression of the inhibitory receptor PD-1 (programmed cell death protein 1), engagement of this receptor leads to T-cell exhaustion, not increased antitumor activity. $#Educational objective# Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is endogenously produced by CD4 cells, CD8 cells, and natural killer (NK) cells and has strong proinflammatory and some anti-inflammatory effects.  High-dose IL-2 therapy can be used for advanced renal cell carcinoma and metastatic melanoma; this can lead to long-lasting remission due to increased cytotoxic activity of NK cells against the tumor.
