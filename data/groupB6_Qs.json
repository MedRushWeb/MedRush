      "explanation_2": "$A history of prolonged bleeding following procedures (eg, dental extractions, surgeries) and spontaneous hemorrhages into the joints (hemarthrosis) is typical for #hemophilia#, an X-linked recessive bleeding disorder due to decreased levels of factor VIII (hemophilia A) or factor IX (hemophilia B). $ Factors VIII and IX are components of the intrinsic coagulation pathway and activate factor X; activated factor X (Xa) then catalyzes the conversion of prothrombin (factor II) into thrombin as part of the final common pathway.  In the absence of factors VIII or IX, activation of factor X and subsequent conversion of prothrombin into thrombin do not occur.  Administration of #thrombin#, however, will make up for the deficiency and lead to blood clotting.  In practice, prothrombin complex concentrates (containing factors II, VII, IX, and X, which lead to thrombin formation) were used for management of hemophilia B, although thrombogenic risks have limited their application. $ In both types of hemophilia, the bleeding time and platelet count are normal.  The prothrombin time (PT) is also normal as it tests the #e#xtrinsic clotting pathway and reflects the function of factors II, V, VII, and X (mnemonic: P#e#T).  However, the activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is prolonged as it assesses the activity of factors II, V, VIII, IX, X, XI and XII, the #i#ntrinsic clotting pathway (mnemonic: P#i#TT).  Diagnoses of hemophilia A and B are made by measuring plasma levels of factors VIII and IX, respectively. $ (Choice A)  Factor XII (Hageman) is synthesized by the liver and is activated by endothelial injury.  It triggers the intrinsic coagulation pathway by activating factor XI.  The addition of factor XII does not clot the blood of patients with hemophilia because the downstream clotting factors VIII or IX are deficient. $ (Choice B)  Fibrinogen is a protein synthesized by the liver.  Thrombin mediates cleavage of fibrinogen to form fibrin, the main component of thrombi; therefore, without thrombin, fibrinogen administration alone would not be helpful. $ (Choice C)  Protein C is a vitamin K-dependent factor synthesized in the liver.  It is a physiologic anticoagulant that degrades factors Va and VIIIa. $ (Choice E)  Urokinase is a thrombolytic agent used for treatment of myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolism.  It acts by converting plasminogen to plasmin, which then breaks down fibrinogen and fibrin into their respective degradation products.  The addition of urokinase would prevent thrombosis. $ Educational objective Bleeding after a tooth extraction and history of hemarthrosis are suggestive of hemophilia.  Decreased levels of factor VIII or IX lead to failure to convert prothrombin into thrombin and deficient thrombus formation.  The addition of thrombin to the blood of a patient with hemophilia results in clotting."

This typically causes an #elevated indirect bilirubin# level and an #undetectable haptoglobin# level (haptoglobin binds free hemoglobin in the circulation), but confirmation of MAHA requires identification of @schistocytes@ (eg, triangle cells, helmet cells) on peripheral blood smear. $ • #Neurologic manifestations# (eg, headache, seizure), #renal insufficiency#, and #fever# (the remainder of the pentad) occur in a minority of patients. $ Unlike patients who have disseminated intravascular coagulation (a consumptive coagulopathy also associated with MAHA and thrombocytopenia), those with TTP have #normal coagulation studies# because coagulation factors are not significantly consumed by the formation of platelet-rich clots #(choice A)#. $ TTP is triggered by the formation of autoantibody inhibitors against #ADAMTS-13#, a protease that #cleaves ultralarge von Willebrand factor# (VWF) multimers in the circulation, reducing their prothrombotic activity.  Patients with TTP have very low levels of ADAMTS-13, which increases the proportion of ultralarge VWF multimers and leads to the aggregation and activation of platelets.  #Plasma exchange#, which removes the autoantibody inhibitors against ADAMTS-13, is generally curative. $ (Choice C)  Expansion of neoplastic myeloid precursors in the bone marrow is seen in acute myeloid leukemia, which can cause anemia and thrombocytopenia due to bone marrow infiltration.

However, all these signs and symptoms are rarely present.  Diagnosis is often made by identifying severe deficiency of ADAMTS-13, a protease that cleaves large von Willebrand factor multimers off the endothelium.",

      "explanation_2": "Deficiencies of folic acid and vitamin B12 are the most important causes of megaloblastic anemia.  Both of these vitamins are required for DNA synthesis in erythropoiesis.  When there is a deficiency of either of these vitamins, cell division is delayed, though the cytoplasm develops normally.  Thus, the cells enlarge (megaloblasts) but do not divide.  The bone marrow is hypercellular in megaloblastic anemia, but the megaloblastic erythroid precursor cells are rapidly destroyed in the bone marrow and few differentiated large RBCs are released into the circulation.  In severe megaloblastic anemia, 90% of erythroid precursors are destroyed without ever entering the circulation. $ Vitamin B12 and folic acid deficiencies cause similar hematological pictures.  However, neurological dysfunction is only seen in patients with vitamin B12 deficiency.  This is because B12 deficiency also causes axonal demyelination and degeneration.  In late disease, the neurological dysfunction may be irreversible.  The main sites of neurological involvement include the peripheral nerves, spinal cord (posterior and lateral columns), and the cerebrum.  Decreased vibratory and position sense are early signs of vitamin B12 deficiency.  Patients experience ataxia and recurrent falls because of compromised proprioception.  Importantly, neurologic abnormalities can occur in vitamin B12 deficiency in the absence of frank anemia.  Treating megaloblastic anemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency with folate alone could worsen the neurological dysfunction. $ An RBC mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of more than 100 fL is suggestive of megaloblastic anemia.  However, RBC macrocytosis can also occur in liver disease, hypothyroidism, and alcohol-induced liver disease.  MCVs greater than 110 fL are typically seen only with vitamin B12 and folic acid anemias.  On peripheral blood smear, there is macrocytosis (large RBCs), hypersegmented neutrophils, and large bizarrely shaped platelets.  The presence of even a single neutrophil with more than 6 lobes should raise the suspicion of megaloblastic anemia. $ The medications listed in the other answer choices are not used for the treatment of megaloblastic anemia.$ Educational Objective Vitamin B12 and folic acid deficiencies cause similar hematological pictures.  However, neurological dysfunction is only seen in patients with vitamin B12 deficiency.  If megaloblastic anemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency is mistakenly treated with folate alone, the neurologic dysfunction can worsen."

HBV is a partially double-stranded DNA virus that is repaired to form a closed circular DNA strand.  HBV DNA is often inserted into the cellular genome, although this is not required for viral replication (unlike HIV).  Integration into regions that control cell growth and differentiation can result in tumorigenesis. $ • #Production of oncogenic viral proteins# – HBV produces a viral protein called #HBx# that is a transcriptional activator of several genes associated with cellular growth.

Because 2 of the 3 cell lines produced by the bone marrow are intact (ie, platelets and leukocytes), it is unlikely that this patient has a disorder that affects the entire bone marrow, such as neoplastic tumor infiltration #(choice A)#. $ The next step is to determine whether the anemia is due to impaired production or increased loss of erythrocytes.  The bone marrow normally releases immature erythrocytes (reticulocytes) in response to severe anemia to compensate for lost oxygen-carrying capacity.  For this reason, a high reticulocyte count suggests the anemia is due to a process outside the bone marrow, such as acute bleeding or hemolysis (eg, intravascular or splenic erythrocyte destruction) #(choice D)#.  In contrast, an #inappropriately low reticulocyte count# (as in this case) suggests a problem with the production of red blood cells in the bone marrow, which may be caused by 1 of the following: $ • #Low erythropoietin# (EPO):  EPO is primarily produced in the cortical peritubular cells of the kidneys.  It travels to the bone marrow, where it stimulates the division and differentiation of erythroid progenitor cells.  A low level of EPO is primarily caused by fibrosis of the peritubular cells due to chronic renal failure.  This patient with a normal creatinine level is very unlikely to have low EPO #(choice B)#. $ • #Lack of nutrients# (eg, vitamin B12, folate, iron):  Efficient erythropoiesis requires adequate levels of vitamin B12, folate, and iron.  Significant deficiencies in these nutrients usually alter the size of mature erythrocytes, leading to changes in mean corpuscular volume (MCV).  Low vitamin B12 or folate eventually causes macrocytosis (high MCV), and low iron eventually causes microcytosis (low MCV). $ • #Destruction of erythrocyte precursors:#  Viruses (eg, parvovirus B19), medications, and #autoantibodies# can destroy erythrocyte progenitor cells, leading to severe anemia with morphologically normal platelets and leukocytes (ie, #red cell aplasia#).  This condition is common with certain tumor types, namely lymphoproliferative disorders (eg, chronic lymphocytic leukemia) and #thymoma#.  Thymoma often causes #mediastinal mass# with pulmonary symptoms (eg, #persistent nonproductive cough#) due to infringement on adjacent airways. $ Educational objective Pure red cell aplasia is a rare form of bone marrow failure characterized by severe anemia with reticulocytopenia and morphologically normal platelets and leukocytes.

Although it occasionally causes pancytopenia (anemia alone is more common), peripheral smear shows rouleaux formation due to increased monoclonal proteins; dysmorphic granulocytes would not be seen.  In addition, multiple myeloma is not strongly associated with chemotherapy exposure.  $(Choice D)  Anemia of chronic disease is associated with increased retention of iron in reticuloendothelial macrophages.  Although low reticulocyte count is common, patients usually have normocytic anemia and relatively normal peripheral smear findings (eg, no dysplasia).  In contrast, MDS can be associated with ringed sideroblasts (iron-laden erythrocyte precursors) in the bone marrow.  $ (Choice E)  Collagen deposition in the bone marrow is associated with myelofibrosis, a chronic myeloproliferative disorder that causes anemia and variable platelet/leukocyte counts.  However, patients typically have marked splenomegaly due to extramedullary hematopoiesis. $ Educational objective Myelodysplastic syndrome is a clonal hematologic neoplasm marked by ≥1 cytopenias and cellular dysplasia (eg, oval macrocytic erythrocytes, hyposegmented granulocytes).

Severe macrocytosis (#MCV >110 µm3#) is usually due to #megaloblastic anemia#, a subtype of macrocytic anemia caused by impaired DNA synthesis.  Cytoplasmic components then accumulate within the slowly dividing erythrocytes, producing cells that are larger than normal (macrocytes). $ Patients with #sickle cell disease# (SCD) or other hemolytic anemias have #increased folic acid requirements# due to increased erythrocyte turnover.  As such, they are prone to developing relative folic acid deficiency and megaloblastic anemia. $ (Choice A)  Extramedullary erythropoiesis can occur in SCD and lead to an elevated reticulocyte count and MCV, as the reticulocytes produced are larger than those released by the bone marrow.  However, this patient's low reticulocyte index (representing the reticulocyte percentage corrected for the degree of anemia) suggests an inadequate response to anemia and a lack of erythropoiesis. $ (Choice C)  Patients with SCD may receive multiple transfusions for treatment of severe or symptomatic anemia.  Transfusion related iron overload can cause severe liver disease, but would be unlikely to produce an MCV >110 µm3. $ (Choice D)  Macrocytosis can occur in liver failure due to an increase in circulating phospholipids and cholesterol that adsorb onto erythrocytes, resulting in membrane expansion.  However, liver-associated macrocytosis is generally mild (<110 µm3) and this patient does not have any findings to suggest advanced liver disease (eg, ascities/edema, bleeding). $ (Choice E)  A disease of the elderly, myelodysplastic syndrome can cause macrocytic anemia.  In the setting of a young patient with SCD and hemolytic anemia, however, folic acid deficiency is much more likely. $ Educational objective An MCV >110 µm3 is highly suggestive of megaloblastic anemia, such as that caused by folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency.  Patients with chronic hemolytic anemia have increased folic acid requirements due to increased erythrocyte turnover and are predisposed to developing macrocytosis."

Her other findings, including the presence of joint pain, a photosensitive rash, and mild renal insufficiency, raise suspicion for #systemic lupus erythematosus# (SLE), an autoimmune disease primarily seen in #young women#.  SLE frequently causes anemia due to a combination of factors, including chronic inflammation (anemia of chronic disease), gastrointestinal serositis (iron deficiency from bleeding), and/or #autoimmune hemolytic anemia# (AIHA). $ Approximately 10% of patients with SLE develop AIHA due to immune dysregulation, which results in the formation of #IgG autoantibodies# against the erythrocyte membrane.  Erythrocytes coated with IgG are subsequently identified by the Fc-receptor on #splenic macrophages# and partially or wholly phagocytized, leading to extravascular hemolysis.  Laboratory assessment typically reveals #elevated reticulocyte count# (ie, reticulocytosis) because interstitial fibroblasts in the kidney sense tissue hypoxia and increase the release of erythropoietin; this drives the bone marrow to increase erythrocytosis, leading to the presence of immature red cells in the peripheral blood (normoblasts, reticulocytes). $ #(Choices A and C)#  The presence of significant reticulocytosis (eg, >4-5%) rules out causes of anemia associated with an impaired bone marrow response, including bone marrow suppression from cancer or infection (eg, parvovirus), anemia of chronic disease (cytokine-mediated retention of iron), and vitamin deficiency (eg, vitamin B12 deficiency from intrinsic factor antibodies, iron deficiency).  $(Choice D)  A normal platelet count effectively rules out anemia due to a microangiopathic process associated with intravascular platelet consumption (eg, thrombotic microangiopathy). $ (Choice E)  Although traumatic intravascular hemolysis can occur with a mechanical heart valve or severe aortic stenosis, it is uncommon in otherwise healthy young individuals.  Furthermore, this patient's heart murmur is most consistent with mitral valve prolapse, which is common in patients with SLE but rarely causes traumatic hemolysis. $ Educational objective Anemia with an elevated reticulocyte count (ie, reticulocytosis) indicates that the bone marrow is responding appropriately to the anemia by generating new erythrocytes.  Reticulocytosis is commonly seen in patients with hemolysis or acute bleeding.  Many other causes of anemia are associated with low reticulocyte count, including bone marrow suppression (eg, parvovirus), iron deficiency anemia, vitamin B12/folate deficiency, and anemia of chronic disease."

The ribosomal RNA can be distinguished using a supravital stain that binds RNA (eg, new methylene blue) and appears as a blue, reticular (ie, net-like) substance. $ Ribosomal RNA is gradually degraded as the reticulocyte matures.  After spending a day or more in the bloodstream, the maturation process is complete, and the reticulocyte transforms into a mature RBC, which has a lifespan of approximately 120 days. $ #(Choices A and D)#  Young reticulocytes contain organelles necessary for cell development, including mitochondria and remnants of Golgi apparatus, which are also removed as the reticulocyte matures.  However, it is the ribosomal RNA that imparts the bluish color on Wright-Giemsa staining.  $ (Choice B)  Heinz bodies consist of denatured hemoglobin precipitate and are associated with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.  They cannot be seen on Wright-Giemsa staining but appear as round, peripheral RBC inclusions using a supravital stain.  $(Choice C)  Histone proteins are found in the nucleus.  During erythropoiesis, the erythroblast ejects its nucleus, forming a reticulocyte; because the reticulocyte does not have a nucleus, it does not contain histones.  $(Choice E)  @Howell-Jolly bodies@ are nuclear remnants visible on Wright-Giemsa staining as purple, round, peripheral RBC inclusions.  They are associated with asplenia or hyposplenia because the spleen typically removes these nuclear remnants. $ Educational objective Reticulocytes (immature red blood cells) appear as blue-gray (ie, polychromatophilic) red blood cells on Wright-Giemsa staining due to the presence of ribosomal RNA.  In patients with iron deficiency anemia, iron supplementation results in increased bone marrow erythropoiesis and accelerated release of reticulocytes into the bloodstream.",

This results in a constitutively active tyrosine kinase that causes malignancy.  Interestingly, patients who harbor this gene fusion are usually young non-smokers, often with adenocarcinoma, who lack mutations in either the epidermal growth factor receptor gene or the K-ras gene.  The kinase activity of this fusion protein is a target of the protein kinase inhibitor, crizotinib.$ The pathophysiology of EML4-ALK NSCLC is most similar to the pathophysiology of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).  In CML, the classic and most common cause is a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22.  The ABL proto-oncogene is transported from chromosome 9 to chromosome 22 where it is placed adjacent to the BCR gene.  The resulting oncogene, BCR-ABL, codes for a fusion protein with constitutive tyrosine kinase activity.  This protein stimulates the proliferation of granulocytic precursors and leads to the development of CML.  The kinase activity of this fusion protein is a target of the protein kinase inhibitor, imatinib.  $ (Choice A)  Burkitt lymphoma is characterized by a translocation of the c-myc oncogene on the long arm of chromosome 8 to the Ig heavy chain region on chromosome 14.  This causes constitutive overproduction of c-myc, a nuclear phosphoprotein that functions as a transcription activator.  $(Choice C)  Patients with follicular lymphoma have a t(14;18) translocation that causes overexpression of the antiapoptotic BCL2 gene product.  $ (Choice D)  Li-Fraumeni syndrome is an autosomal dominant predisposition to a variety of cancers, particularly sarcomas and tumors of the breast, brain, and adrenal cortex.  This syndrome is associated with a mutation of the tumor suppressor gene, p53. $ (Choice E)  Translocation between the cyclin D1 locus on chromosome 11 and the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus on chromosome 14 is characteristic of mantle cell lymphoma.  This abnormality results in increased production of cyclin D1, a promoter of the G1 to S-phase transition during the cell cycle.  $Educational objective Some patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) harbor a chromosomal rearrangement that creates a fusion gene between EML4 (echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4) and ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase).

Follicular lymphoma is the most common #indolent# non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in adults and the second most common NHL overall (after diffuse Large B cell lymphoma).  It derives from germinal center B cells and typically has a long, #waxing and waning# clinical course. $ The condition most often presents in middle-aged patients with #painless lymph node enlargement# or abdominal discomfort from an abdominal mass.  Histology is notable for a @nodular pattern@, and the neoplastic follicles are composed of a mixture of centrocytes (cleaved cells) and centroblasts (noncleaved cells).  The majority of tumors exhibit a #t(14;18) translocation#, resulting in overexpression of the BCL2 oncogene that blocks programmed cell death. $ (Choice A)  Acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma is the most common malignancy in children.  It presents with lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, fever, bleeding, and bone pain.  Neoplastic cells are pre-B or pre-T cells (lymphoblasts). $ (Choice B)  Burkitt lymphoma is a highly aggressive (but generally chemotherapy-responsive) B-cell NHL associated with chronic Epstein-Barr virus infection and/or deregulation of the MYC proto-oncogene.  Patients typically develop rapidly growing tumor masses in the facial bones, jaw, or abdomen.  Tumor doubling time is very rapid and spontaneous tumor lysis can occur. $ (Choice C)  Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma typically presents with a rapidly enlarging nodal (neck, abdomen, mediastinum) or extranodal symptomatic mass.  The Waldeyer's ring (oropharyngeal lymphoid tissue) and gastrointestinal tract are commonly involved, and systemic ‘B’ symptoms (fever, weight loss, drenching night sweats) can also be seen. $ (Choice E)  Hairy cell leukemia, a mature B-cell neoplasm, presents with splenomegaly and pancytopenia most often in older men.  Lymph node enlargement is not characteristic.  Leukemic cells have hairlike cytoplasmic projections and are positive for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP). $ (Choice F)  Mycosis fungoides is a cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.  Proliferating CD4+ atypical lymphocytes infiltrate the dermis and epidermis, where they form Pautrier microabscesses.  This condition manifests with plaques (often on trunk or buttocks) that may be confused with eczema or psoriasis.  Generalized erythema and scaling and thickening of the skin (erythroderma) may result. $ Educational objective Follicular lymphoma is the most common indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma in adults.  It is of B-cell origin and presents with painless waxing and waning (ie, fluctuating) lymphadenopathy.  The cytogenetic change t(14;18) is characteristic and results in overexpression of the BCL2 oncogene.",

Therefore, a platelet-activated thrombotic microangiopathy such as #thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura# (TTP) or hemolytic uremic syndrome is most likely. $ In this case, the patient has 4 of the 5 classic findings of acquired TTP: $ • Severe thrombocytopenia, which may cause bruising or bleeding $ • MAHA, which may cause symptomatic anemia (eg, fatigue, dyspnea on exertion) $ • #Renal damage#, which may cause #renal insufficiency# (eg, elevated creatinine) and mild #proteinuria# $ • #Neurologic damage#, which may cause confusion, #headache#, and #transient focal findings# (eg, numbness, weakness) $ • Fever (not present)$ Although this pentad of findings is classic, all 5 manifestations are rarely seen.

Typical manifestations include palpable purpura, renal disease, and arthritis/arthralgias.  Platelet counts are usually normal. $ (Choice C)  Some features of this patient's presentation could be explained by plasma cell dyscrasias such as multiple myeloma (renal failure, anemia due to bone marrow replacement) and Waldenström macroglobulinemia (neurologic symptoms due to hyperviscosity, autoimmune hemolytic anemia).  However, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia would be atypical. $ (Choice D)  A cerebrovascular accident caused by plaque rupture could cause neurologic deficits but would not account for the patient's hematologic and renal abnormalities. $ Educational objective Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura frequently results from impaired function of the von Willebrand factor (vWF)–cleaving protease ADAMTS-13, which causes the accumulation of uncleaved vWF multimers that are significantly more prothrombotic.

    "explanation_2": "This patient developed #acute hemolytic anemia# (eg, jaundice, dark urine, low haptoglobin) after taking a new medication, suggesting glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase #(G6PD) deficiency#.  @G6PD@ catalyzes production of NADPH in erythrocytes; loss of G6PD function limits regeneration of reduced glutathione, impairing the ability of erythrocytes to handle increased #oxidative stress# (eg, foods, medications).  The trigger in this case was likely #primaquine# prescribed for malaria prophylaxis. $ Manifestations of G6PD deficiency typically begin within 2-5 days and often include pallor, #dark urine#, and #jaundice#.  Laboratory evaluation reveals signs of #erythrocyte lysis# such as elevated bilirubin, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, and low haptoglobin (protein that binds free heme).  The bone marrow responds by releasing young erythrocytes, leading to #reticulocytosis#.  Peripheral smear will demonstrate signs of denatured hemoglobin precipitation such as intraerythrocytic dark inclusions (@Heinz bodies@). $ G6PD deficiency is an #X-linked recessive# disorder; males (46,XY) who carry the mutation are affected because all erythrocytes have the defective G6PD gene.  Females (46,XX) who carry a copy of the defective gene (heterozygous) are usually unaffected because random inactivation of the X chromosome (lyonization) results in ~50% of erythrocytes with the normal gene.  However, heterozygous females can develop acute hemolysis when lyonization is @skewed@ toward expression of the mutated gene. $ (Choice A)  Most structural erythrocyte abnormalities (eg, hereditary spherocytosis) are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.  Although jaundice from hemolysis can be seen, peripheral smear would not show Heinz bodies. $ (Choice B)  In contrast to G6PD deficiency, most other erythrocyte enzyme deficiencies (eg, pyruvate kinase [PK] deficiency) are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.  PK catalyzes the last step in @glycolysis@; because erythrocytes rely solely on glycolysis for ATP production (due to a lack of mitochondria), patients develop chronic (not episodic) hemolysis. $ (Choice C)  Mitochondrial DNA is of maternal origin.  Mitochondrial diseases generally limit cellular ATP generation due to impaired oxidative phosphorylation and often present with neuromuscular dysfunction.  Heinz bodies would not be seen; in addition, hemolysis following medication exposure indicates likely G6PD deficiency. $ (Choice D)  X-linked dominant disorders affect males and females equally.  Nearly all cases of symptomatic G6PD deficiency occur in males, indicating an X-linked recessive inheritance pattern. $ Educational objective Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is an X-linked recessive disorder that causes acute hemolysis after exposure to oxidizing medications, foods, or acute infection.  Nearly all affected persons are male, but heterozygous females can become symptomatic due to skewed lyonization.",

This leads to a #prothrombotic state# that places patients at high risk for both arterial and venous thrombosis. $ (Choice A)  Acquired protein C deficiency occurs early in the course of warfarin therapy, as the inhibition of protein C by warfarin occurs more rapidly than the inhibition of other factors (ie, factors II, VII, IX, X).  If not bridged with heparin when starting therapy, patients may develop warfarin-induced skin necrosis due to localized cutaneous thrombus formation. $ (Choice C)  Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) results from splenic destruction of platelets labeled by IgG antibodies to glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors.  ITP often causes very low platelet levels and is associated with bleeding complications rather than thrombosis. $ (Choice D)  Cryoglobulinemia can occur in the setting of autoimmune disease (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus) or viral infection (eg, hepatitis C) and causes systemic vasculitis characterized by fatigue, arthralgia, and purpuric rash.  Marked thrombocytopenia is not typical. $ (Choice E)  Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) results from decreased levels of the von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease ADAMTS13.  The classic presentation of TTP is the pentad of fever, thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, renal insufficiency, and neurologic dysfunction. $ Educational objective Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis results from the production of IgG antibodies against complexes of heparin and platelet factor 4.

    "explanation_2": "$This patient with daytime sleepiness, recurrent headaches, and snoring most likely has #obstructive sleep apnea# (OSA).  Excess tissue around the extrathoracic upper airways (eg, from obesity) can predispose to upper airway collapse during sleeping.  As a result, patients with OSA may have up to 500 episodes of asphyxia per night. $ In adults, the main response to hypoxemia is coordinated by the #kidneys#.  In the renal cortex, peritubular fibroblasts sense hypoxia using the transcription factor #hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha# (HIF-1α).  When oxygen is readily available, @HIF-1α@ is marked for proteasomal degradation.  Under low oxygen conditions, intracellular levels of HIF-1α accumulate, substantially increasing erythropoietin (EPO) production. $ EPO is secreted into the bloodstream, acting on the bone marrow to accelerate @erythrocyte precursor@ maturation #(choice A)#.  The rapid rise in the number of mature erythrocytes leads to #secondary polycythemia# (eg, elevated hematocrit).  As a result, the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood rises, helping to compensate for chronic hypoxemia. $ (Choice B)  The brain does not regulate erythropoiesis in response to hypoxemia.  Instead, severe cerebral hypoxia drives increased sympathetic tone, increasing respiration, cerebral perfusion pressure, and oxygen delivery.  $(Choice C)  In response to hypoxemia, the liver helps supply iron (by suppressing hepcidin and upregulating transferrin) to support EPO-driven red blood cell production.  However, iron mobilization alone is insufficient to increase erythropoiesis.  For this reason, patients with severe @chronic kidney disease@ (low EPO production), even when chronically hypoxemic, often have anemia and fail to develop secondary polycythemia.  $(Choice D)  With OSA, the lungs do not receive adequate oxygen delivery due to recurrent upper airway collapse.  In response to chronic alveolar hypoxemia, HIF-1α activation in the lungs contributes to sustained pulmonary vasoconstriction and pulmonary hypertension.  However, the lungs do not participate in erythropoiesis. $ (Choice F)  The spleen is the major site of erythrocyte destruction, not production.  In states of chronic hypoxemia, severe anemia, or bone marrow dysfunction, tissues with resident hematopoietic stem cells (eg, spleen, liver) can respond by participating in erythropoiesis (ie, extramedullary hematopoiesis). $ Educational objective The kidneys respond to chronic hypoxemia (detected by the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha) by substantially increasing production of erythropoietin.  This hormone circulates to the bone marrow, where it accelerates the maturation of erythrocyte precursors, resulting in an elevated hematocrit (secondary polycythemia).",

It is thought to be due to a #transient hypercoagulable state# that can occur during the #first few days# of warfarin therapy. $ The overall anticoagulant effect of #warfarin# is due primarily to its inhibition of the vitamin K-dependent gamma-carboxylation of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X ('vitamin K-dependent clotting factors').  However, warfarin also decreases carboxylation of proteins C and S, which normally exert an anticoagulant effect (through proteolysis and deactivation of factors V and VIII).  #Protein C# has a #short half-life#, so its anticoagulant activity is reduced quickly when warfarin therapy is initiated, by about 50% within the first day.  During this time, the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors II, IX, and X continue to exert a procoagulant effect as they have longer half-lives (factor VII has a short half-life similar to protein C). $ This difference in half-lives translates into a transient hypercoagulable state: $ • Decreased protein C (anticoagulant) activity → procoagulant effect $ • Persistent clotting factor II, IX, and X activity → procoagulant effect $ Thrombosis and clot can interrupt blood flow to the skin and lead to skin necrosis.  For this reason, overlapping coadministration of heparin #(\"heparin bridge\")# is commonly used when warfarin is initiated.  The risk of warfarin-induced skin necrosis is increased in patients with a preexisting protein C deficiency, as well as in those started on a large loading dose of warfarin. $ (Choice A)  Warfarin affects coagulation factor carboxylation, not synthesis. $ (Choice B)  Factor VII inhibition by warfarin has an anticoagulant effect. $ (Choice C)  Warfarin does not have a major direct effect on factor XI activity that would cause skin necrosis. $ #(Choices D and F)#  Fibrinogen and prothrombin activity may be impacted downstream, but this is not the primary process affected by warfarin. $ Educational objective Warfarin inhibits proteins C and S (natural anticoagulants present in blood), which can lead to skin necrosis, particularly in patients with protein C or S deficiency.  This complication is usually seen in the first few days of warfarin therapy."

    "explanation_2": "This is a young patient with recurrent deep venous thromboses, features indicative of a hypercoagulable state.  Inherited causes of hypercoagulability must be considered in all patients under age 50 who present with thromboses in the absence of any obvious explanation for an acquired prothrombotic state. $ The patient's plasma is resistant to the normally antithrombotic effects of activated protein C.  Thus, the most likely diagnosis is a mutation in the factor V gene, which renders factor Va resistant to inactivation by activated protein C.  A specific factor V mutation, known as the Leiden mutation, and mutations in the prothrombin gene are the most common inherited causes of hypercoagulability.  Activated protein C resistance (factor V Leiden mutation) is detected in approximately 20% (range 12–40%) of patients with abnormal venous thromboses. $ (Choice A) Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is a common immune cause of hypercoagulability.  This condition is defined by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (lupus anticoagulant and/or anticardiolipin antibodies) plus one or more of the following: venous thromboembolism, arterial thromboembolism, or frequent fetal loss.  Unlike the patient in the vignette, patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome typically have a prolonged baseline aPTT.  Lupus anticoagulants are the most common cause of aPTT prolongation. $ (Choice B) Folic acid deficiency can cause hyperhomocysteinemia, which is a prothrombotic state.  However, activated protein C resistance is not seen with this condition. $ (Choice D) Endovascular infections and/or systemic inflammatory states may affect vascular endothelial cells in a way that favors thrombosis.  However, infection and inflammatory mediators do not directly promote activated protein C resistance in the aPTT coagulation test. $ (Choice E) A paraneoplastic syndrome of hypercoagulability may be seen in some patients with cancer, especially patients with adenocarcinomas of the pancreas, colon, or lung.  The mechanism of cancer-induced hypercoagulability is thought to involve release of procoagulant tumor products.  Vascular stasis due to obstruction of blood flow by the tumor, patient immobility, hepatic involvement and dysfunction, sepsis, and advanced age may also contribute to the tendency toward thrombosis in cancer patients.  None of these mechanisms/factors directly promotes activated protein C resistance in the aPTT coagulation test. $ Educational Objective Inherited causes of hypercoagulability should be considered in patients younger than age 50 who present with thrombosis and no obvious explanation for an acquired prothrombotic state.  The factor V Leiden mutation, which causes factor Va resistance to inactivation by activated protein C, may account for approximately 20% of cases of atypical venous thrombosis."

Female use of cigarettes peaked in 1955, and mortality rates increased 20-50 years after smoking onset.  Lung cancer mortality began to decrease after 2000, corresponding to a decline in tobacco use. $ Tobacco is a causative factor for numerous other cancers (eg, leukemia, nasopharyngeal, larynx, esophagus, pancreas, cervix, colon).  It is directly carcinogenic to tissue by causing irritation and inflammation of the body's natural protective barriers.  Patient education about tobacco's harmful effects is extremely important, as smoking cessation for even longtime users can be beneficial for reducing cancer risk and improving life expectancy. $ (Choice B)  Breast cancer is the most common non-skin cancer and the second most common cause of cancer death among women in the United States.  Mortality from breast cancer began to decrease in the 1990s.  Increased use of adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation and more frequent breast cancer screening are likely contributing factors to this decline. $ (Choice C)  Colon cancer mortality has decreased since the 1950s due to advances in surgical technique and adjuvant chemotherapy.  Additional protective factors may include colorectal cancer screening, menopausal hormone therapy in women, and aspirin use. $ (Choice D)  The incidence and mortality of pancreatic cancer have increased in women over the last century and recently became the fourth most common cause of cancer death in women.  Pancreatic cancer trends, like those of lung cancer, follow the pattern of increased smoking in women.  However, lung cancer is responsible for three times more deaths than pancreatic cancer in women. $ (Choice E)  Stomach cancer incidence and mortality decreased drastically over the first half of the twentieth century.  Proposed reasons include advances in refrigeration and food preservation (leading to decreased salt intake), and better sanitation and more adequate housing (reducing Helicobacter pylori infection rates).  $Educational objective Between 1950 and 2000, rising rates of tobacco use resulted in an increase in female lung cancer incidence and mortality.  Lung cancer is currently the most common cause of cancer death in both women and men in the United States.",

It resolves and recurs in a predictable pattern, a finding characteristic of #cyclic neutropenia#.  Cyclic neutropenia occurs due to a mutation in the gene encoding #neutrophil elastase#.  This enzyme is normally packaged within neutrophil granules and plays a role in the degradation of virulence factors on bacterial pathogens. $ #Misfolded# neutrophil elastase increases endoplasmic reticulum #stress#, causing a portion of the neutrophil precursors in the bone marrow to undergo apoptosis.  Bone marrow aspirate would show #myeloid progenitor cells# with features characteristic of apoptosis (eg, nuclear fragmentation, membrane blebbing).  The depressed ANC is thought to transiently upregulate granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), which stimulates neutrophil production from the hematopoietic stem cells that did not undergo apoptosis.  As neutrophil numbers normalize, G-CSF production decreases, allowing neutrophil counts to decline again. $ Clinical manifestations of cyclic neutropenia correlate with #neutrophil nadirs#, which typically occur every 3 weeks, and include recurrent episodes of fever, fatigue, and #mucositis# (eg, gingival ulcers, inflammation) in young children.  Life-threatening infection in cyclic neutropenia is rare due to the brief duration of neutropenic periods, and patients are typically asymptomatic between episodes.

Persistently low, not oscillating, ANCs are often seen along with anemia and/or thrombocytopenia. $ Educational objective Cyclic neutropenia occurs as a result of a mutation in the gene encoding neutrophil elastase.

MYC is overexpressed in a variety of malignancies, including Burkitt lymphoma, which is characterized by translocations involving the MYC gene located on chromosome 8, most frequently with the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene. $ (Choice E)  Tumor suppressor protein p53, encoded by TP53 on chromosome 17, stops the cell cycle when DNA damage is identified.  Inactivation of p53 is seen in many malignancies.  Li-Fraumeni cancer syndrome is an autosomal dominant syndrome caused by an inherited TP53 mutation, resulting in an increased risk of malignancy (eg, sarcoma, breast). $ Educational objective Follicular lymphoma is a common, indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma.  It is characterized by a translocation involving BCL2 on chromosome 18, which becomes positioned near the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene on chromosome 14, resulting in overexpression of BCL2 (an antiapoptotic protein)."

    "explanation_2": "Lymphadenopathy can represent inflammatory changes within the lymph node (reactive hyperplasia) or malignant transformation.  Reactive hyperplasia is a broad term that encompasses all benign, reversible enlargement of the lymphoid tissue secondary to an antigenic stimulus.  The nodal response to antigenic stimuli is highly variable and can be classified as follicular hyperplasia, sinus hyperplasia, or diffuse hyperplasia.  Follicular hyperplasia occurs when the follicles increase in size and number, whereas sinus hyperplasia occurs when the sinuses enlarge and fill with histiocytes.  Diffuse hyperplasia is observed when the nodal architecture is diffusely effaced by sheets of lymphocytes, immunoblasts, and macrophages.  When malignant transformation occurs (as in lymphomas), the normal lymph node architecture is distorted or effaced by the proliferation of malignant lymphoid cells, often to a greater extent than that seen with reactive hyperplasia.  Malignancy-associated effacement of nodal architecture may be follicular or diffuse. $ Reactive lymphoid hyperplasia is polyclonal in that it consists of a proliferation of many different cell types within the lymph node.  For each type of lymphocyte responding to an antigenic stimulus, multiple genetically-distinct cells of that variety undergo limited monoclonal expansion, leading to an overall polyclonal response.  Malignant transformation, in contrast, is monoclonal in that it results from the unchecked proliferation of a single genetically unique cell from only one cell line. $ Evaluation for monoclonality of the lymphocyte population is important when lymphoma is suspected.  The clonality of a T-cell population is assessed by molecular methods, such as PCR, that examine the rearrangement of T-cell receptor (TCR) genes.  If a single allele for the V region of the T-cell receptor predominates in a lymphocytic population, monoclonal proliferation is suspected.  The same principle applies when assessing B-cell clonality.  Monoclonal rearrangement of the genes for immunoglobulin variable regions is suggestive of a B-cell lymphoma.  Of the choices given, monoclonal TCR gene rearrangement is most indicative of malignant processes, especially in the context of appropriate clinical features (i.e., weight loss, night sweats, fever, anorexia). $ #(Choices A, B, & C)#  Pleomorphism, increased mitoses, and nuclear changes are all commonly seen in the lymphocytes of a reactive hyperplastic lymph node.  These findings do not automatically classify the specimen as malignant. $ (Choice E)  An admixture of several lymphoid cell types in a lymph node is suggestive of a benign process.  A predominantly monomorphic cell population is indicative of malignancy and is characteristic of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.  Hodgkin’s lymphoma does demonstrate an admixture of several lymphoid cell types within the lymph nodes; however, this finding does not distinguish Hodgkin’s lymphoma from reactive hyperplasia.  Additionally, genetic analysis of Reed-Sternberg cells most often reveals monoclonal characteristics.  $Educational objective Benign lymph node enlargement in response to antigenic stimulation is associated with a polyclonal proliferation of lymphocytes.  A monoclonal lymphocytic proliferation is strong evidence of malignancy."

Complications include peptic ulcer disease (altered mucosal blood flow due to increased viscosity) and gouty arthritis (higher erythrocyte turnover).  Laboratory studies show #increased erythrocyte mass# and low erythropoietin levels; thrombocytosis and leukocytosis are also characteristic of polycythemia vera.  Erythrocyte indices are usually normal. $ Polycythemia vera is caused by abnormal transduction of erythropoietin growth signals.

Although laboratory results were normal when he was discharged a month ago, his complete blood cell count now reveals signs of ongoing infection (neutrophilic leukocytosis) and inflammation (anemia, thrombocytosis). $ Infections are associated with the release of #inflammatory cytokines# (eg, IL-6, TNF-alpha) from activated immune cells.  Elevated circulating concentrations of IL-6 stimulate the liver to increase production of #thrombopoietin#, which triggers #megakaryocyte proliferation and maturation# in the bone marrow.  The subsequent increase in serum platelet count is called reactive thrombocytosis because it is a secondary process that typically resolves when the infection is adequately treated.  #Reactive thrombocytosis# is seen in a wide range of inflammatory (eg, malignancy, rheumatologic disease, burns) and noninflammatory (eg, iron deficiency, hemolysis, blood loss, postsplenectomy) conditions and is the most common cause of elevated platelet count in all age groups. $ Elevated circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines also trigger the liver to generate hepcidin, which down-regulates iron absorption in the gut and iron release by the reticuloendothelial system; this frequently leads to concurrent #anemia of chronic disease# (normocytic anemia) due to reduced iron availability for reticulocytosis. $ #(Choices A and E)#  Essential thrombocythemia, a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by the autonomous clonal proliferation of megakaryocytes, is marked by thrombocytosis, vasomotor symptoms (eg, dizziness), and increased risk of thrombosis.

    "explanation_2": "This patient's costovertebral angle tenderness, dysuria, and leukocytosis are indicative of acute pyelonephritis complicated by septic shock (hypotension, tachycardia).  Her laboratory results show a consumptive coagulopathy (thrombocytopenia, prolonged PT/PTT, low fibrinogen), which, along with bleeding from the central catheter site, are likely due to #disseminated intravascular coagulation# (DIC). $ DIC is a common complication of #sepsis# (particularly with gram-negative organisms) because #lipopolysaccharide# is a #procoagulant#that triggers the coagulation cascade.  This leads to the formation of fibrin- and platelet-rich thrombi in the vasculature, which consumes platelets #(thrombocytopenia)#, coagulation factors #(prolonged PT/PTT)#, and fibrinogen.  Fibrinolysis is then triggered to degrade the clots, which #elevates D-dimer# (a fibrin degradation product) and depletes protein C, protein S, and antithrombin.  The thrombi also often shear red blood cells, leading to #microangiopathic hemolytic anemia# (MAHA). $ Most patients with acute DIC have signs of bleeding, such as #oozing from vascular catheters#, mucocutaneous bleeding, ecchymosis, or petechiae.  End organ damage (eg, renal insufficiency, pulmonary hemorrhage) is also common. $ (Choice A)  Anticardiolipin antibody is antiphospholipid antibody often seen in patients with lupus erythematosus.  It can cause antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, which is marked by thromboembolism and fetal loss (not bleeding).  Although patients often have prolonged PTT (because the antiphospholipid interferes with the PTT test), PT is normal. $ (Choice B)  Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is caused by reduced activity of von Willebrand factor–cleaving protein ADAMTS13, leading to the accumulation of ultra-large von Willebrand factor multimers that trap platelets and generate platelet-rich thrombi in the microvasculature.  Although patients usually develop thrombocytopenia, MAHA, fever, confusion, and organ damage (eg, acute renal failure), the coagulation cascade is unaffected; therefore, PT/PTT and fibrinolysis (fibrinogen level) are normal, and bleeding does not occur. $ (Choice D)  Immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is marked by autoantibodies to platelets/megakaryocytes; thrombocytopenia is the only peripheral blood abnormality.  Coagulation studies (eg, PT, PTT) and fibrinogen levels are normal.  Spontaneous bleeding is very uncommon unless the platelet count is <10,000/mm3. $ (Choice E)  The liver generates thrombopoietin and the majority of clotting factors.  Therefore, patients with significantly impaired hepatic function (eg, cirrhosis) sometimes have mild thrombocytopenia and prolonged coagulation studies.  However, fibrinogen level is usually normal and this patient has no other signs of advanced hepatic dysfunction (eg, ascites, jaundice). $ Educational objective Disseminated intravascular coagulation commonly occurs in the setting of sepsis and is characterized by widespread activation of the coagulation cascade with formation of microthrombi.  Laboratory results reveal prolonged PT/PTT, thrombocytopenia, and low fibrinogen (ie, a consumptive coagulopathy), and patients usually have signs of bleeding (eg, oozing from venipuncture sites)."

This leads to the formation of a new gene called #PML/RARα#.  Normally, RARα plays a role in the proper differentiation of myeloid precursors, as the receptor interacts with retinoic acid to affect transcription of genes required for maturation.  However, the t(15;17) mutation in APML causes transcription repression and produces an #abnormal receptor# that is unable to signal for the differentiation of myeloid precursors at physiologic doses of retinoic acid. $ Treatment with #all-trans-retinoic acid# (ATRA), a vitamin A derivative, overcomes this (partly by inducing PML/RARα proteolysis) and stimulates differentiation of myeloblasts into mature granulocytes.  ATRA therapy induces remission in about 90% of patients with APL.  APL is associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation. $ (Choice A)  Acute lymphocytic leukemia predominantly affects children.  Blast cells positive for the CD10 antigen (CALLA) suggest a good prognosis. $(Choice C)  Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is frequently seen in elderly patients.

Neoplastic cells resemble mature B lymphocytes. $ (Choice D)  In chronic myeloid leukemia (also commonly manifesting in elderly patients with fatigue, leukocytosis, and splenomegaly), myeloid precursors in different stages of differentiation proliferate.  This disease is caused by a t(9;22) translocation that forms the BCR-ABL fusion gene, which codes for an abnormal tyrosine kinase. $ (Choice E)  Several high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphomas are associated with cytogenetic abnormalities.  t(8;14), t(2;8), and t(8;22) are typical for Burkitt lymphoma; these translocations involve the c-myc oncogene.  Burkitt lymphoma is associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection and classically has a \"starry sky\"A histologic appearance. $ Educational objective Acute promyelocytic leukemia is the M3 variant of acute myelogenous leukemia.  It affects adult patients and may present with disseminated intravascular coagulation.  The cytogenetic abnormality t(15;17) leads to formation of the promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha (PML/RARα) fusion gene, which is unable to signal for proper cellular differentiation, unlike the normal retinoic acid receptor."

Erythropoiesis is not affected, and the peripheral blood smear is normal. $ (Choice B)  Myeloblasts containing cytoplasmic Auer rods on peripheral blood smear are a characteristic finding of @acute myeloid leukemia@, which typically presents with complications of pancytopenia (eg, bruising from thrombocytopenia, infection from neutropenia). $ (Choice C)  Autoimmune destruction of gastric parietal cells causes atrophic gastritis, which can lead to pernicious anemia (a type of megaloblastic anemia) due to vitamin B12 malabsorption.  @Megaloblastic anemia@ is characterized by hypersegmented neutrophils and macro-ovalocytes (large, oval RBCs). $ (Choice E)  Babesiosis is endemic in the northeastern United States and commonly presents with fever, fatigue, and myalgia.  Although it can be detected in a peripheral blood smear, @Babesia@ typically appears as a ring or tetrad form (ie, Maltese cross) within RBCs. $ (Choice F)  Patients with splenic dysfunction (eg, functional asplenia, splenectomy) may have @Howell-Jolly bodies@ (nuclear remnants normally removed by the spleen), which typically appear as solitary, dark blue-purple inclusions at the periphery of RBCs. $ Educational objective Coarse basophilic stippling (dark blue-purple granules throughout red blood cells) and hypochromic, microcytic anemia are common peripheral blood smear findings in lead poisoning.  High-risk groups include young children ingesting paint chips and industrial workers inhaling particulate lead.",

  "explanation_2": "This patient with a rapidly enlarging #jaw mass# likely has endemic (ie, African-type) Burkitt lymphoma, of which jaw involvement is a characteristic feature.  #Burkitt lymphoma# is a mature B-cell malignancy associated with overexpression of the #MYC# protooncogene, which encodes a transcription factor that regulates cell growth.  Approximately 80% of Burkitt lymphoma cases are associated with translocation of MYC on chromosome 8 to the immunoglobulin heavy chain region of chromosome 14 [#t(8;14)#].  This translocation leads to MYC overexpression and uncontrolled tumor cell growth, resulting in #rapid mass enlargement#. $ Histologically, @Burkitt lymphoma@ is characterized by a sea of medium-sized, basophilic (ie, blue) lymphoid cells with numerous #mitotic figures# (indicating brisk proliferation) and #apoptotic bodies#.  Scattered tingible body macrophages, which digest the apoptotic debris, create the characteristic \"#starry sky appearance#\". $ Although very aggressive, Burkitt lymphoma responds well to short-term, intensive, high-dose chemotherapy. $ (Choice A)  In follicular lymphoma, t(14;18) results in overexpression of the BCL2 gene, which encodes an antiapoptotic protein.  Follicular lymphoma causes generalized lymphadenopathy and tends to affect the elderly.  A rapidly enlarging jaw mass would be very unusual. $ (Choice B)  The BCR-ABL1 fusion gene, the characteristic abnormality seen in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), produces a constitutively active tyrosine kinase that results in uncontrolled proliferation of granulocytes.  Patients with CML typically have nonspecific symptoms (eg, fatigue) and leukocytosis, not a rapidly enlarging jaw mass. $ (Choice C)  The BRAF protooncogene encodes a protein kinase in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway.  Activating BRAF point mutations lead to cell proliferation and are associated with hairy cell leukemia (eg, splenomegaly, cytopenia) and melanoma. $ (Choice E)  The RET protooncogene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in cell growth, and mutations can result in constitutive activation.  RET mutations are associated with medullary thyroid carcinoma and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2. $ Educational objective Burkitt lymphoma is usually associated with translocations of the MYC gene on chromosome 8 to the immunoglobulin heavy chain region of chromosome 14 [t(8;14)], resulting in MYC overexpression.

Once deposited in cells, iron binds to apoferritin to form ferritin micelles.  Because iron is used poorly in patients with thalassemia and cannot be excreted actively, the ferritin micelles accumulate in macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system.

In normal hemostasis, activated protein C (APC) restricts clot formation by proteolytically inactivating factors Va and VIIIa.  Factor Va Leiden has reduced susceptibility to cleavage by APC, however.  Because factor Va is a cofactor in the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, persistently circulating factor Va Leiden results in increased thrombin production.  Additionally, factor V Leiden is unable to support APC anticoagulant activity.  This combination of increased coagulation and decreased anticoagulation produces the hypercoagulable state seen in those with factor V Leiden. $ (Choice A) Petechiae and ecchymoses are more consistent with qualitative or quantitative platelet abnormalities than factor V Leiden. $ (Choice B) Recurrent hemarthroses are suggestive of hemophilia (factor VIII or IX deficiency), not factor V Leiden. $ (Choice C) Renal artery stenosis is primarily caused by atherosclerosis and fibromuscular disease, not thrombosis.  Moreover, factor V Leiden is associated with an increased risk of deep venous (not arterial) thrombosis. $ (Choice D) Major causes of splenic infarction include sickle cell anemia, infectious endocarditis, and myeloproliferative disorders.  Moreover, the factor V Leiden mutation is associated with deep venous (not arterial) thrombosis. $ Educational Objective Heterozygote carriers of a mutation in factor V Leiden, which is modified to resist activated protein C, have a hypercoagulable state that predisposes to deep vein thromboses (the source of most pulmonary emboli)."

Due to increased glomerular capillary wall permeability in nephrotic syndrome, many important substances are lost in the urine, causing a number of complications.  Loss of anticoagulant factors, especially #antithrombin III#, leads to a hypercoagulable state, of which RVT can be a manifestation.  Patients with RVT can develop sudden-onset abdominal or #flank pain# and gross #hematuria# with #elevated lactate dehydrogenase# as a result of renal infarction. $@Left-sided varicoceles@ are relatively common in healthy pubertal men as the aorta and superior mesenteric artery can compress the left renal vein (\"nutcracker effect\"), resulting in increased intravascular pressure in the left gonadal vein with retrograde blood flow and varicocele formation.  However, a new-onset left varicocele associated with ipsilateral flank pain and hematuria should raise suspicion for RVT causing impaired left gonadal venous drainage. $#(Choice A)#  Albumin is also lost in massive quantities in urine in nephrotic syndrome, leading to hypoproteinemia, decreased intravascular oncotic pressure, and fluid shifts into the interstitium.  Albuminuria explains the patient's edema (improved from his previous visit) but not his acute flank pain, hematuria, and left-sided varicocele, which are more likely due to thrombosis.  Protein loss also results in a negative nitrogen balance. $#(Choice B)#  Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is an inherited condition that results in early emphysema and liver cirrhosis. $#(Choice D)#  Serum ceruloplasmin is decreased in Wilson disease (hepatolenticular degeneration), which is clinically characterized by liver disease, motor abnormalities, and psychiatric symptoms.  Ceruloplasmin has no role in the pathogenesis of nephrotic syndrome. $#(Choice E)#  The loss of immunoglobulins and low-molecular-weight components of complement (such as factor B) makes patients with nephrotic syndrome vulnerable to infections, especially pneumococcal infections. $#(Choice F)#  Lipiduria is common in nephrotic syndrome as a result of increased lipoprotein synthesis by the liver and increased glomerular capillary wall permeability, leading to lipid loss in the urine in the form of free fat and oval fat bodies (with characteristic Maltese cross appearance under polarized light).  However, lipiduria does not contribute to the hypercoagulable state. $#Educational objective# Nephrotic syndrome is a hypercoagulable state.  Sudden-onset abdominal or flank pain, hematuria, and left-sided varicoceles suggest renal vein thrombosis, a well-known complication of nephrotic syndrome.  Loss of anticoagulant factors, especially antithrombin III, is responsible for the thrombotic and thromboembolic complications of nephrotic syndrome.  ",

Treatment with a #monoclonal antibody# (eg, trastuzumab) that targets the HER2 surface receptor often results in tumor regression.  Although antibody binding can trigger cancer cell death through a variety of mechanisms (eg, receptor downregulation, complement deposition), much of the response is due to #antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity# (ADCC). $ADCC classically involves the following:  $1. A naturally occurring or monoclonal #IgG# binds to a complementary surface antigen on a host or foreign cell.  $2.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient's #recurrent infections# in the setting of intact T lymphocyte function (positive response to Candida antigens) and very low immunoglobulin levels suggest #X-linked (Bruton) agammaglobulinemia# (XLA).  This condition results from a mutation in the Bruton tyrosine kinase gene that causes failure of bone marrow @pre-B cells@ to develop into mature B lymphocytes.  As a result, patients have absent or very low B lymphocytes in the peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues. $In general, B lymphocytes aggregate in the cortex of lymph nodes to form lymphoid follicles.  Primary follicles are dense and dormant; secondary follicles have a pale germinal center containing proliferating B cells in response to an antigenic stimulus.  In XLA, primary lymphoid follicles and #germinal centers do not form# due to an #absence of B cells#. $Lack of mature B lymphocytes also leads to inability to produce plasma cells, and patients therefore have absent or #very low serum immunoglobulins#.  Recurrent infections typically begin once maternally derived antibodies wane (age 3-6 months), as seen here. $#(Choice B)#  The outer cortex is composed of primary and secondary lymphoid follicles (ie, B cell–rich regions), but it also contains prominent numbers of CD4+ T cells within the interfollicular regions (allowing for T-B cell interaction).  In patients with XLA, the outer cortex is present but diminished. $#(Choice C)#  The paracortical zone lies internal to the cortex of the lymph node.  This zone is populated primarily by T lymphocytes and dendritic cells.  Dendritic cells present antigens collected from the blood and lymph to the T lymphocytes aggregated in this section of the node.  This patient's positive reaction to Candida antigens (type 4 hypersensitivity) indicates intact T lymphocyte function. $#(Choices D and E)#  The subcapsular sinuses are found between the capsule and the cortex of the lymph node and are in direct communication with afferent lymphatic vessels.  These sinuses are connected to cortical sinuses that line the trabeculae and penetrate through the cortex and paracortex to reach the medulla.  From there, medullary sinuses drain into the efferent lymphatic channel.  These structures are not affected in XLA. $#Educational objective# X-linked (Bruton) agammaglobulinemia is caused by a defect in B cell maturation, resulting in absent mature B cells and severely low immunoglobulin levels.  T cell numbers and function remain intact.  Due to the absence of B cells, primary lymphoid follicles and germinal centers do not form within lymph nodes.  ",

However, CAR-T cell therapy is not associated with myelofibrosis.  In addition, risk of secondary malignancy after CAR-T cell therapy appears to be low overall. $#(Choice E)#  Chemotherapy often causes transient myelosuppression due to destruction of rapidly dividing hematopoietic cells.  Anti-CD19 therapy may reduce B-cell populations but does not significantly affect other hematologic cells. $#Educational objective# Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy involves extracting T cells from a patient with malignancy, inserting a CAR gene against a protein overexpressed by the malignancy, and then reinfusing the modified T cells back into the patient.

For this reason, patients are typically treated with heparin or LMWH during initiation of warfarin therapy. $#(Choice E)#  Prothrombin (factor II) is a vitamin K-dependent clotting factor.  This factor, along with factors VII, IX, and X, is depleted by warfarin.  LMWHs inhibit prothrombin production (through factor X inhibition), but they do not directly bind prothrombin. $#Educational objective# Enoxaparin is a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) that functions like heparin i n that it binds and activates antithrombin III (AT III).  Activated AT III binds to factor Xa and stops factor Xa from converting prothrombin to thrombin.  Due to its fewer number of molecules, LMWH acts primarily on factor Xa, not thrombin.  "

  "explanation_2": "$The @cellular growth cycle@ consists of 4 distinct phases:  G1, S, G2, and M.  Progression through the phases is controlled by surveillance systems (checkpoints) that interrupt the cell cycle and/or induce apoptosis if cells do not meet the requirements to progress forward: $• The transition from G1→S (initiation of DNA replication) is controlled by a combination of cell size and nutrient status, exposure to growth factors, and proper surveillance and repair of damaged DNA. $• At the G2→M transition, the cell again checks for DNA damage and repairs replication errors before they can be passed on to daughter cells during mitosis.  An additional spindle checkpoint ensures that duplicated chromosomes separate appropriately during cell division. $#Cyclin-dependent kinases# (CDKs) 4 and 6 control cell cycle progression from G1→S.  These CDKs are activated by cyclin D and subsequently inhibit the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein, leading to the upregulation of transcriptional factors that #progress the cell cycle# to S phase.  Many cancers exploit this crucial checkpoint and achieve unregulated cellular growth via cyclin D amplification (or inactivating mutations to retinoblastoma gene). $#CDK 4/6 inhibitors# (eg, palbociclib) can be used to block the cyclin D binding site on CDK, which results in decreased CDK 4/6 activation, increased activity of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein, and cell cycle arrest.  Although CDK 4/6 inhibitors are generally well tolerated, they often #inhibit #cellular replication in other #rapidly dividing cells#, particularly hematologic cells in the #bone marrow#.  This can result in treatment-limiting hematologic side effects such as neutropenia, leukopenia, and anemia. $#(Choice C)#  Immunotherapy that targets PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 enhances the immune response against cancer and is often used in the treatment of malignant melanoma.  The major side effects of these medications are autoimmune-related adverse events, including skin, liver, gastrointestinal, and endocrine inflammation. $#(Choices B, D, and E)#  CDK 4/6 inhibitors do not generally cause adverse side effects in cells that are arrested in G0, such as myocytes, cochlear hair cells, or neurons.  Cardiomyopathy is a common side effect of anthracyclines (eg, doxorubicin) and HER2 antibodies (eg, trastuzumab).  Sensorineural hearing loss can be seen with platinum-based chemotherapy (eg, cisplatin).  Peripheral neuropathy is a common side effect of vincristine and bortezomib. $#Educational objective# Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 4/6 regulate the movement of cells from G1→S phase.  Cancers often have mutations that enhance the activity or downstream effects of CDK 4/6, which contribute to unregulated cellular growth.  Inhibitors to CDK 4/6 can be used to treat certain forms of cancer.  However, they can inhibit cellular replication in other rapidly dividing cells such as the hematologic cells in the bone marrow (eg, neutropenia, anemia, or thrombocytopenia).  ",

Folic acid is a required precursor to nucleic acid synthesis.  Barriers to its metabolism are especially effective in hindering the growth of rapidly proliferating cells such as in a developing embryo or certain types of cancer. $Normally, folic acid is reduced to dihydrofolate (DHF) by dihydrofolate reductase and then reduced further to #tetrahydrofolate# (THF), an integral precursor of #DNA synthesis#.  MTX is structurally similar to folic acid and competitively and irreversibly #inhibits DHF reductase#.  DHF reductase inhibition prevents the formation of THF #(choice D).# $After entering the target cell, MTX undergoes #polyglutamation#, which prevents the movement of MTX out of the cell, resulting in intracellular accumulation of MTX for later use.  Similarly, folate and recycled DHF are stored within the cell via polyglutamation.  Because MTX inhibits DHF reductase, folic acid and DHF polyglutamate will accumulate in cells. $#(Choice B)#  Folinic acid (leucovorin) is a reduced form of folic acid that can be used to counter the toxic effects of MTX chemotherapy.  Folinic acid selectively \"rescues\" normal cells by competing with MTX for DHF reductase binding sites.  It can reactivate DHF reductase, therefore allowing re-initiation of DNA synthesis. $#(Choice C)#  Para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) is a folic acid precursor in prokaryotes.

The major product of COX-1 in platelets is #thromboxane A2#, which promotes #platelet activation and aggregation# (eg, increased glycoprotein IIb/IIIa expression). $• COX-2, which is expressed in an inducible manner in response to cytokine release by immune cells (eg, macrophages).  Major products of this enzyme are prostaglandins, some of which promote fever, inflammation, and pain sensitivity. $#Aspirin#, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), primarily inhibits COX-1 when administered in low doses (ie, 81-324 mg/day).  Aspirin is unique compared to other NSAIDs because this #inhibition is irreversible# (via acetylation), resulting in a sustained decrease in thromboxane A2 production by platelets for the duration of their lifespan (ie, 3-7 days).  Therefore, aspirin has a prolonged antithrombotic effect and is commonly used to reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with coronary artery disease.  Because this inhibition of platelet aggregation lasts for the #platelet lifespan#, preoperative aspirin discontinuation is recommended #at least 5 days prior# to surgery to avoid excessive bleeding. $Higher aspirin doses significantly inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2, thereby also exhibiting antipyretic and analgesic effects due to decreased prostaglandin production.

  "explanation_2": "$The two antineoplastic agents described in the question stem are methotrexate (Drug X) and 5-fluorouracil (Drug Y).  Methotrexate is a folic acid analog that functions by binding and inactivating dihydrofolate reductase, the enzyme responsible for reducing folic acid to tetrahydrofolate.  Tetrahydrofolate participates in the transfer of carbon groups in certain intracellular reactions including purine and thymidine synthesis.  5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is a pyrimidine analog that primarily functions to inhibit DNA synthesis by inhibition of thymidylate synthetase after enzymatic conversion to its nucleotide floxuridine monophosphate by any of a number of intracellular reactions. $The key metabolic difference between methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil is that methotrexate prevents the reduction of folic acid to tetrahydrofolate, while 5-FU binds tetrahydrofolate and thymidylate synthetase in a stable-reaction intermediate form, thereby effectively decreasing the amount of thymidylate synthetase available for thymidine synthesis. $Leucovorin (N5-formyl-tetrahydrofolate) is a tetrahydrofolate derivative that does not require reduction by dihydrofolate reductase before it can function as a cofactor for thymidylate synthase and other enzymes involved with purine and amino acid synthesis.  Because leucovorin bypasses the dihydrofolate reductase step that is inhibited by methotrexate, it can be used to \"rescue\" normal cells from the toxicity of methotrexate.  5-FU, on the other hand, requires the presence of reduced folate in order to form complexes with thymidylate synthetase.  5-FU has a reduced cytotoxic effect in cells that are deficient in tetrahydrofolate.  For this reason, leucovorin can be utilized to potentiate the toxicity of fluoropyrimidines such as fluorouracil by strengthening the association of the drug with thymidylate synthase. $#(Choice A)# Cytarabine, like 5-FU, is also a pyrimidine analog antimetabolite that is incorporated into DNA leading to strand termination.  It does not affect folate metabolism.  Gemcitabine is another pyrimidine analog that functions much like cytarabine.  It differs from cytarabine in that it is not S-phase specific, likely owing to additional cytotoxic functions such as inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase. $#(Choice C)# Fludarabine is a deamination-resistant purine nucleotide analog that exerts its cytotoxicity by many mechanisms, including inhibition of DNA polymerase, DNA primase, DNA ligase, and ribonucleotide reductase.

The most common triggers of drug-induced hemolysis are anti-inflammatory medications, penicillins, and cephalosporins (eg, #ceftriaxone#).  Although the mechanism of erythrocyte injury (eg, oxidative, complement mediated) varies depending on the medication, penicillins and cephalosporins typically cause hemolysis by binding to the erythrocyte surface, which creates a #hapten for IgG attachment#.  Antibody-coated erythrocytes are then partially or wholly phagocytized by splenic macrophages, leading to #extravascular hemolysis#. $Hemolysis is often associated with symptomatic anemia (eg, fatigue, pallor) and signs of hyperbilirubinemia (eg, jaundice, dark urine).  Laboratory evaluation will typically reveal #elevated indirect bilirubin# (heme breakdown product), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (intracellular enzyme), reticulocytosis (increased immature RBCs), and lowered haptoglobin (binds free hemoglobin).  The diagnosis is confirmed with the #direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test#, which detects IgG or C3 (a complement fragment) on the erythrocyte surface.  Because hemolysis is triggered by the direct binding of the penicillin or cephalosporin to the erythrocyte membrane, #cessation of the offending drug# eliminates the antibody target and generally leads to complete resolution of symptoms within days. $#(Choice B)#  Anemia of chronic disease is caused by cytokine-mediated iron dysregulation.  Although chronic infection (eg, viral hepatitis, tuberculosis) is a common trigger, anemia of chronic disease is gradual in onset and is not associated with hyperbilirubinemia (no RBC lysis). $#(Choice C)#  Certain antibiotics (eg, sulfa medications, chloramphenicol) are associated with myelosuppression.  However, these medications generally cause pancytopenia, not isolated anemia; in addition, hyperbilirubinemia is not seen. $#(Choice D)#  Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is marked by hemolysis in the setting of oxidative stress due to infection, oxidizing medication, or oxidative foods.  Although this patient has an infection, ceftriaxone is not an oxidizing medication.  In addition, G6PD deficiency is X-linked; therefore, symptoms are less common in women. $#(Choice E)#  Severe infections can trigger disseminated intravascular coagulation, a consumptive coagulopathy associated with anemia due to erythrocyte injury from microvascular thrombi.  However, these patients have prolonged coagulation times and thrombocytopenia. $#Educational objective# Penicillins and cephalosporins are common triggers for drug-induced hemolytic anemia because they can bind to the erythrocyte surface and act as haptens for IgG attachment.  Subsequent clearance of IgG-coated erythrocytes by splenic macrophages leads to hemolytic anemia.  Withdrawal of the offending drug usually leads to complete resolution of symptoms.  "

Topoisomerase I makes single-stranded nicks to relieve negative supercoiling, while topoisomerase II induces transient breaks in both DNA strands simultaneously to relieve both positive and negative supercoiling.  Etoposide and podophyllin specifically inhibit topoisomerase II's ability to seal the strand breaks it induces, causing chromosomal breaks to accumulate and eventual cell death.

When large numbers of tumor cells are destroyed in a short period, massive quantities of intracellular tumor products are released into the circulation, which frequently results in the following: $• Hyperkalemia, which can cause fatal heart arrhythmias. $• Hyperphosphatemia, which precipitates calcium in the renal tubules and collecting system, leading to systemic hypocalcemia and acute renal injury from calcium-phosphate stones. $• Hyperuricemia, which precipitates urate crystals in the renal tubules and collecting system, leading to acute renal injury. $Aggressive #intravenous fluids# during and after chemotherapy can help prevent kidney injury by flushing phosphorous and uric acid out of the kidneys.

As a result, warfarin administration leads to prolongation of the prothrombin time (PT) and INR (ratio of a patient's PT compared to a normal control).  In patients with atrial fibrillation, deep venous thrombosis, or PE who are taking warfarin for anticoagulation, the dose is usually adjusted to achieve a target therapeutic INR range (generally 2.0-3.0). $Precise dosing of warfarin can be difficult due to its many interactions with other drugs that affect cytochrome P-450 activity, plasma protein binding, and/or gastrointestinal absorption.  Warfarin elimination occurs primarily through hepatic metabolism by cytochrome P-450 enzymes.  Drugs that #increase P-450 activity#, such as #phenytoin#, phenobarbital, and rifampin, #increase warfarin elimination# and decrease its anticoagulant activity (reflected as a subtherapeutic INR <2.0).

The resulting platelet activation leads to the following: $• Release of mediators (eg, ADP, thromboxane A2 [TXA2]) into circulation, which in turn activates other platelets $• Conformational structural change of #GP IIb/IIIa# on platelet surfaces; this allows thousands of copies of GP IIb/IIIa to bind #fibrinogen#, thereby forming a #platelet plug#. $#Abciximab#, a #GP IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist#, inhibits binding of this receptor to fibrinogen.  Abciximab and other GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors are useful for treatment of unstable angina and acute coronary syndrome, particularly in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. $#(Choices B, E, F, and G)#  Argatroban (used in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia) and dabigatran (used in atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism) are direct thrombin inhibitors.  Heparin potentiates antithrombin III activity, leading to inactivation of thrombin and factor Xa; warfarin prevents K-mediated carboxylation of several coagulation factors.  All these medications have @anticoagulant effects@. $#(Choices C and D)#  Aspirin, a cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and 2 inhibitor, inhibits TXA2 (via platelet COX acetylation), thereby preventing platelet aggregation.  Clopidogrel inhibits platelet aggregation by blocking P2Y12 on platelet ADP receptors. $#Educational objective# Abciximab is a blocker of glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor, which normally promotes platelet binding to fibrinogen.

This creates an anticoagulant state that is reflected on laboratory assessment as a prolonged INR.  Because the effect of warfarin is significantly altered by certain foods and medications, patients on long-term warfarin are at risk for subtherapeutic or #supratherapeutic INR# due to any of the following: $• Change in dietary vitamin K intake: Increase in dietary vitamin K increases the availability of vitamin K in the liver, which counters the inhibitory effect of warfarin on epoxide reductase.  Therefore, patients on warfarin are advised to eat a consistent amount of vitamin K–containing foods (eg, leafy greens, brussels sprouts). $• #Disruption to intestinal flora:# Intestinal flora produce vitamin K as a byproduct of metabolism.  Therefore, antibiotics that target gram-negative bacteria such as metronidazole, macrolides, and fluroquinolones can cause supratherapeutic INR due to destruction of vitamin K–producing bacteria in the gut.  In this patient, the #administration of an antibiotic# (eg, ciprofloxacin) for pyelonephritis likely destroyed gram-negative bacteria in her gut, thereby #reducing vitamin K production# and causing a supratherapeutic INR. $• Alteration to cytochrome P450 2C9 activity: Several medications induce or inhibit cytochrome P450 2C9, which alters the speed of warfarin metabolism.  For instance, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampin increase cytochrome P450 2C9 activity, which can result in a subtherapeutic INR #(choice D).#  In contrast, metronidazole, fluconazole, and amiodarone inhibit cytochrome P450 2C9 activity, which can result in a supratherapeutic INR. $#(Choice A)#  Aspirin exerts an anticoagulation effect by inhibiting the release of thromboxane A2 by platelets, which subsequently reduces platelet aggregation.  This can lead to prolonged bleeding time but does not increase INR. $#(Choice C)#  Anticlotting factor antibodies can occasionally occur due to recent pregnancy, malignancy, or rheumatologic disease.  Most cases involve inhibition of factor VIII, which leads to a bleeding diathesis and prolonged aPTT (not INR, which reflects PT).  This patient with a recent infection treated with antibiotics is more likely to have supratherapeutic INR due to disruption of vitamin K production by intestinal flora. $#(Choice E)#  Increased dietary vitamin K leads to a subtherapeutic INR due to increased vitamin K availability in the liver. $#Educational objective# Patients on warfarin who take antibiotics that target gram-negative microorganisms (eg, metronidazole, macrolides, fluroquinolones) can develop supratherapeutic INR due to disruption of vitamin K–producing intestinal flora.

Following ingestion, 6-MP is converted by hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) into 6-thioguanine (6-TG) active metabolites #(choice C).#  The 6-TG metabolites are purine analogues that act as false nucleotides to disrupt DNA and RNA synthesis and inhibit the proliferation of hematopoietic cells, a useful effect in the treatment of autoimmune disease, organ transplant rejection, and some types of cancer (eg, leukemia). $6-MP is #metabolized into inactive metabolites# by 2 different enzymes, #xanthine oxidase# and #thiopurine methyltransferase# (TPMT), both of which are clinically important.  Coadministration of 6-MP with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor (eg, allopurinol, febuxostat) slows the inactivation of 6-MP and shunts metabolism toward the production of 6-TG active metabolites; therefore, the dose of 6-MP must be significantly reduced.  In addition, roughly 12% of the population has a genetic mutation resulting in low or absent activity of TPMT, creating a high risk of toxicity with the administration of 6-MP.  Therefore, some clinicians recommend that patients undergo genetic testing for TPMT activity prior to initiating 6-MP (or azathioprine) therapy. $#(Choice A)#  Adenosine deaminase (ADA) converts adenosine to inosine as part of purine metabolism.  This enzyme is deficient in severe combined immunodeficiency but may be overexpressed in some malignancies.  Cladribine, which is used in the treatment of hairy cell leukemia, is a cytotoxic purine analogue resistant to degradation by ADA. $#(Choice B)#  Methotrexate is used in the treatment of cancer and rheumatologic disease.  It inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, thereby blocking the conversion of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and disrupting the synthesis of thymidine and, to a lesser extent, purines. $#(Choice D)#  Monoamine oxidase inhibitors are used in the treatment of atypical depression; these agents inhibit degradation of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin. $#(Choice E)#  Cyclophosphamide, used to treat many types of cancer, requires bioactivation by the cytochrome P-450 mixed-function oxidase system. $#(Choice F)#  Topoisomerase II is inhibited by the chemotherapeutic agents etoposide and teniposide. $#Educational objective# 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) is an immunosuppression drug that is inactivated by 2 enzymes, xanthine oxidase and thiopurine methyltransferase.

  "explanation_2": "$Patients with #sickle cell disease# (SCD) have a missense mutation in the beta globin gene that leads to the substitution of valine for glutamic acid in the 6th position of the beta globulin chain.  This altered form of hemoglobin is called #hemoglobin S# (Hb S); unlike normal adult hemoglobin (Hb A), Hb S polymerizes when deoxygenated or dehydrated, leading to erythrocyte membrane damage (ie, intravascular #hemolysis#) and clogging of small vessels (ie, painful #vasoocclusive crises#, ischemia). $Heterozygotes for Hb S are usually asymptomatic because there is enough Hb A to prevent extensive polymerization of Hb S, but homozygotes typically have severe disease.  These individuals often require repeated blood transfusions for symptomatic anemia and treatment with #hydroxyurea#, an antimetabolite that inhibits the ribonucleotide reductase enzyme.  Although inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase leads to the myelosuppressive effects of hydroxyurea (it causes cell cycle arrest in rapidly dividing hematopoietic cells), hydroxyurea also shifts globin gene transcription from the beta globin locus to the #gamma globin# locus (via unclear mechanisms), thereby #increasing #circulating levels of #fetal hemoglobin# (HB F). $HB F is unaffected by the sickle cell mutation (because it is not composed of beta chains) and has physiologic properties similar to hemoglobin A; therefore, hydroxyurea is often used in the treatment of SCD to improve oxygen delivery, reduce vasoocclusive crises, and lessen need for transfusions. $#(Choice A)#  The calcium-dependent (Gardos) potassium channel regulates the transport of potassium and water through the erythrocyte membrane; blocking this channel could help prevent erythrocyte dehydration but has not been shown to improve symptoms. $#(Choice B)#  Voxelotor directly inhibits polymerization of Hb S by binding to the alpha chain of the molecule and causing an allosteric change that results in increased oxygen binding. $#(Choice C)#  Hb A2 is a variant of normal adult hemoglobin that has 2 delta chains instead of 2 beta chains.  Because it does not contain the abnormal beta chains, increased hemoglobin A2 could reduce sickle cell crises.  However, hydroxyurea increases gamma globulin expression, not delta globulin expression. $#(Choice E)#  L-glutamine, a precursor to the antioxidant glutathione, reduces oxidative stress in erythrocytes with HB S.  It is used for patients with SCD who have persistent vasoocclusive pain or those who cannot tolerate hydroxyurea. $#(Choice F)#  Stimulation of erythrocyte production (eg, erythropoietin) would likely worsen vasoocclusive crises by increasing circulating levels of Hb S.  Hydroxyurea inhibits (not stimulates) the production of erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets by blocking ribonucleotide reductase; however, patients with SCD still benefit from administration due to stimulated HB F production. $#Educational objective# Hydroxyurea is used in patients with sickle cell disease to increase expression of gamma globin chains, which leads to increased circulating fetal hemoglobin (Hb F) concentration.  This reduces vasoocclusive crises and symptomatic anemia episodes.  "

AA is a form of #bone marrow failure# caused by damage to #multipotent hematopoietic stem cells#.  Most cases are induced by direct toxicity to hematopoietic stem cells or an alteration to stem cell surface antigens, which leads to their subsequent destruction by cytotoxic lymphocytes. $Although AA can be idiopathic, it is often triggered by ionizing radiation, toxic chemicals, viral infections, or medications.  Drug-induced AA is typically categorized as follows: $• #Dose-dependent reactions# are caused by medications (eg, chemotherapy, immunosuppressives) that are toxic to the bone marrow when drug levels exceed a certain concentration for a certain period.

Treatment frequently includes medications that inhibit proteasome activity (eg, bortezomib) or increase ubiquitination of regulatory proteins produced in excess in neoplastic cells (eg, #lenalidomide#). $Lenalidomide is a derivative of thalidomide, an antiemetic agent used in pregnancy until significant teratogenic effects were identified.  Lenalidomide increases the binding affinity of the #E3 ubiquitin ligase complex# to specific #transcription factors# (TFs) (eg, Ikaros and Aiolos 2 zinc finger transcription factors) that are overexpressed in myeloma cells.  Binding attaches ubiquitin to the TFs, which leads to their subsequent #destruction by the proteasome#.  Because these TFs are required for myeloma cell survival, diminished intracellular concentrations cause cell death.

When these are inhibited, the #tensile strength# of the wound remains #low#, and dehiscence can occur even weeks to months after initial wound closure. $#(Choice B)#  Radiation therapy, commonly used in cancer treatment, causes DNA damage, resulting in apoptosis of susceptible (eg, highly proliferative) cells.  However, it also damages surrounding noncancerous tissues, including local blood vessels, which can subsequently develop progressive eccentric myointimal proliferation and luminal obstruction.  This can eventually result in tissue ischemia (eg, chronic skin ulcers). $#(Choice C)#  Vinca alkaloids such as vincristine and vinblastine inhibit cytoskeleton microtubule development.  This results in the arrest of cell division and replication at the @metaphase stage@, leading to failure of division and cell death. $#(Choice D)#  Anti-inflammatory agents such as glucocorticoids can impair inflammatory cell migration to the wound site.  Suppression of inflammation, the wound-healing phase that precedes proliferation, can delay the progression of wound healing. $#(Choice E)#  Vitamin C deficiency can result in inadequate hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues during collagen synthesis.  Because hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine are essential for collagen cross-linking, vitamin C deficiency compromises collagen cross-linking and reduces the maximal tensile strength of the wound. $#Educational objective# Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the binding of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to its receptor.  This inhibits angiogenesis and limits blood supply to tumors (ie, cancer-starving therapy).  However, it also impairs wound healing and can lead to wound dehiscence.  ",

Warfarin inhibits the vitamin K dependent g-carboxylation of the glutamic acid residues of clotting factors II, VII, IX and X, causing production of dysfunctional coagulation proteins. $The therapeutic effect of warfarin is monitored by measuring the prothrombin time (PT).  The international normalized ratio (INR) is a standardized PT.  The target INR for therapeutic warfarin anticoagulation is 2-3.   Bleeding is a common complication of warfarin therapy and the risk is increased with INRs above 3.0.  Treatment of life-threatening bleeding requires rapid reversal using fresh frozen plasma.  Vitamin K can help to reverse warfarin action, but the effects take time. $#(Choice B)#  Protamine is used for heparin reversal.  It acts by binding and chemically inactivating heparin. $#(Choice C)#  Aminocaproic acid is an antifibrinolytic agent that inhibits plasminogen activators and, to a lesser degree, antiplasmin activity.  Aminocaproic acid helps achieve hemostasis when fibrinolysis is the cause of bleeding. $#(Choice E)#  Whereas fresh frozen plasma contains all of the coagulation factors, cryoprecipitate contains only cold-soluble proteins (Factor VIII, fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, and vitronectin). $#(Choice F)#  Desmopressin is a synthetic analogue of anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) used in the treatment of diabetes insipidus.  At high doses, desmopressin increases factor VIII activity in patients with hemophilia A and von Willebrand disease.  High-dose desmopressin can help control bleeding associated with these disorders. $#Educational objective# Both vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma are used for reversing warfarin-induced anticoagulation.  Fresh frozen plasma rapidly reverses warfarin's effects whereas vitamin K requires time for clotting factor re-synthesis.  "

  "explanation_2": "This patient with sickle cell disease (SCD) has #pancytopenia#, a decrease in all 3 blood cell lineages.  Pancytopenia is caused by hematopoietic stem cell dysfunction, bone marrow infiltration, or peripheral destruction of mature blood cells.  Important clues in this case include: $• #Low reticulocyte count:#  Patients with severe anemia usually have increased reticulocytes due to enhanced bone marrow erythropoiesis.  The presence of pancytopenia with an #inappropriately low# reticulocyte count usually indicates the #bone marrow is impaired# and is unable to adequately generate new cells despite strong growth signals (eg, increased erythropoietin). $• #Macrocytosis:#  Although macrocytosis can be seen in a wide range of pathologies, the presence of pancytopenia plus macrocytosis usually indicates a vitamin deficiency (eg, vitamin B12, folate) or a medication (eg, hydroxyurea) is #impairing DNA synthesis# in hematopoietic cells. $#Hydroxyurea #inhibits #ribonucleoside reductase#, an enzyme that generates deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates for #DNA synthesis/repair#.  A lack of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates slows erythrocyte nuclear development, leading to decreased cellular division with an overall increase in erythrocyte size.  High doses of hydroxyurea also impair nuclear development in precursors of leukocytes and thrombocytes, leading to pancytopenia. $Hydroxyurea is the major disease-modifying medication in SCD; it reduces production of the mutated beta globulin gene and increases production of the fetal hemoglobin gene, which increases fetal hemoglobin (HbF).  Because HbF functions normally, erythrocytes with increased HbF are less likely to sickle in the microvasculature. $#(Choice A)#  Autoimmune hemolytic anemia is associated with high (not low) reticulocytes due to increased erythropoiesis.  Because reticulocytes are larger (MCV 125-135 µm3) than mature erythrocytes, reticulocytosis can cause macrocytosis; however, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia would not be seen. $#(Choice B)#  Folate is a methyl group donor for the synthesis of purines and pyrimidines.  Folate deficiency impairs DNA synthesis, which can lead to pancytopenia and macrocytosis.  However, this patient is taking folic acid, making deficiency unlikely. $#(Choice C)#  Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is an acquired disorder of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells marked by lack of @complement inhibitor@ on the erythrocyte surface.  Hemolytic anemia is the primary manifestation; reticulocytosis is common, and pancytopenia rarely occurs. $#(Choice E)#  SCD can cause hypersplenism due to splenic congestion with damaged erythrocytes.  Although this can occasionally cause pancytopenia, patients with hypersplenism usually have splenomegaly and normocytic (not macrocytic) anemia. $#Educational objective# Hydroxyurea increases fetal hemoglobin production, which reduces erythrocyte sickling in patients with sickle cell disease.  It also inhibits ribonucleoside reductase, which decreases deoxynucleoside triphosphates available for DNA synthesis; this leads to macrocytosis and, with high doses, pancytopenia.  ",

  "explanation_2": "$This patient's ECG (irregularly irregular rhythm with absent P waves) suggests #atrial fibrillation (AF)#, which alters cardiac flow dynamics, making thrombus formation more common.  If this thrombus detaches from the atrial wall, there is a risk of stroke.  The oral anticoagulant #warfarin# (Coumadin) reduces thrombus formation risk by inhibiting the activation of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X #(vitamin K antagonist)#.  This leads to decreased levels of these factors, particularly #factor VII#, and therefore prolongs the @prothrombin time (PT)@.  Another useful laboratory value is the #International Normalized Ratio (INR)#, a ratio of the patient's PT to a control (usual INR target for AF: 2.0-3.0).  Examples of indications include AF, deep venous thrombosis, and pulmonary thromboembolism.  Outpatients who take warfarin typically have their INR checked every few weeks (more frequently initially). $The most common side effect is excessive anticoagulation leading to bleeding (which can require vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma if rapid reversal is needed).  Skin necrosis can occur during the first few days of treatment due to a transient hypercoagulable state (reduction in protein C anticoagulant activity before affecting other factors' procoagulant activity); for this reason, heparin is typically administered temporarily at the start of warfarin therapy (\"heparin bridge\").  Warfarin should not be used during pregnancy because it is teratogenic and can cause fetal bleeding. $#(Choice A)#  Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is used to monitor unfractionated heparin, which primarily affects the intrinsic coagulation pathway. $#(Choice B)#  Bleeding time is used for the assessment of platelet function.  Increased bleeding time can be seen with thrombocytopenia, von Willebrand disease, defects of platelet aggregation, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and aspirin therapy. $#(Choices C and D)#  The combination of a decreased fibrinogen level and the presence of fibrin split products (such as D-dimer) is characteristic of DIC. $#Educational objective# Warfarin is an oral anticoagulant that inhibits the carboxylation of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X.  It is used in atrial fibrillation, deep venous thrombosis, and pulmonary thromboembolism.

Treatment with factor VIII replacement products (eg, factor VIII concentrate from plasma) can prevent or treat bleeding in these patients.  However, long-term efficacy is often limited by the formation of neutralizing antibodies #(factor VIII inhibitors)#. $#Emicizumab#, a bispecific monoclonal antibody, mimics the normal physiologic function of factor VIII and can be used to prevent or treat bleeding in patients who have factor VIII inhibitors.

  "explanation_2": "#Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting# (CINV) is a common side effect of cancer treatment.  It is caused by both peripheral and central mechanisms, as follows: $• #Acute-phase CINV# (<24 hours after chemotherapy) is mediated primarily by the release of #serotonin# from intestinal enterochromaffin cells that have been damaged by chemotherapy.  Serotonin stimulates vagal afferent fibers (5-HT3 receptors) in the bowel wall, which project to the brainstem and stimulate the vomiting reflex.  Therefore, #serotonin receptor antagonists# (eg, ondansetron) can be used for treatment. $• #Delayed-phase CINV# (1-5 days after chemotherapy) is mediated primarily by increased levels of #substance P# in the brainstem due to chemotherapy-associated emetic stimuli in the cerebrospinal fluid and bloodstream.  Substance P binds to and activates the #neurokinin-1# (NK1) #receptor# in areas of the brainstem that mediate vomiting (eg, nucleus tractus solitarius, area postrema).  Therefore, #NK1 receptor antagonists# (eg, aprepitant, fosaprepitant) are often used for treatment. $Most patients who undergo chemotherapy associated with a high risk of vomiting (eg, cisplatin) receive a combination of serotonin receptor antagonists and NK1 receptor antagonists (often with other antiemetics) to prevent both types of CINV. $#(Choice B)#  Malignancy-related anorexia is the loss of muscle and fat caused by elevated levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines.  Progesterone analogs (eg, megestrol acetate) are the first-line treatment; corticosteroids and cannabinoids are also frequently used. $#(Choice C)#  Malignancy-related hypercalcemia is typically treated with bisphosphonates (eg, zoledronic acid), which reduce osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. $#(Choice D)#  Opioid-induced constipation occurs due to opioid-mediated effects on the bowel wall, which reduce peristalsis.  Methylnaltrexone, an opioid antagonist that has limited ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (it does not trigger withdrawal), can be used as treatment. $#(Choice E)#  Patients who have highly aggressive lymphomas and leukemias are at risk for tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) with chemotherapy.  Its primary manifestation is renal damage from elevated uric acid levels (catabolism of nucleic acids released from tumor cells increases uric acid).  Rasburicase, a drug that breaks down uric acid, is used to prevent TLS in high-risk patients. $#Educational objective# Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting is mediated by peripheral and central mechanisms.  It can be treated with serotonin receptor antagonists (eg, ondansetron) to prevent serotonin stimulation of afferent vagal fibers in the bowel wall (peripheral cause) and neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists (eg, aprepitant) to prevent the effects of substance P in the brainstem (central cause).

Colonic, mucosal, and cutaneous bleeding is common in patients with severe AS due to #acquired von Willebrand syndrome#. $Von Willebrand factor (vWF) is a multimeric glycoprotein generated by endothelial cells and platelets.  It plays 3 important roles in hemostasis: $• vWF binds to sites of endothelial injury and serves as a scaffold for platelet aggregation. $• vWF promotes platelet aggregation at sites of high shearing pressure (often seen in areas of endothelial injury). $• vWF acts as a carrier protein for factor VIII, which dramatically reduces the metabolism of factor VIII. $The activity of vWF is greatest when it is in large, multimeric forms.  However, large multimers of vWF are also most susceptible to unfolding in areas of #high shear forces#, exposing a cleavage site that makes them more vulnerable to destruction by the ADAMTS13 metalloproteinase.  Because patients with severe AS typically have high shearing forces across the damaged valve, they have #increased cleavage of vWF multimers#, which eventually leads to vWF deficiency.  Valve repair can reverse the bleeding diathesis. $#(Choice B)#  The activity of ADAMTS13 is elevated in patients with severe AS because vWF multimers become unfolded by the high shear stress, leading them to be more susceptible to metalloproteinase destruction.  Decreased activity of ADAMTS13 is seen in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, which is marked by microvascular thrombosis. $#(Choice C)#  Decreased hepatic synthesis of clotting factors can cause coagulopathy in patients with cirrhosis.  Factor VIII levels are frequently low in patients with severe AS, which is due to increased destruction of vWF, not reduced hepatic synthesis. $#(Choice D)#  Acquired antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is seen primarily in those with systemic lupus erythematosus or other rheumatologic conditions.  It is marked by arterial or venous thrombosis or pregnancy complications; bleeding diathesis is uncommon. $#(Choice E)#  Uremia reduces platelet adhesiveness and platelet aggregation, leading to an increased risk for bleeding.  This patient has AS, not kidney disease. $#Educational objective# Patients with severe aortic stenosis are at high risk for mucocutaneous and colonic bleeding due to acquired von Willebrand deficiency.  The von Willebrand factor multimers become unfolded by the high shear stress, leading to increased destruction by the ADAMTS13 metalloproteinase.  "

Its manifestations include the following: $• #Hemolysis:#  Repeated @sickling@ of red blood cells leads to permanent deformation and premature erythrocyte destruction by macrophages and mechanical stress.  This causes #intra- and extravascular hemolysis#, resulting in increased indirect bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase and #decreased haptoglobin#.  Haptoglobin binds circulating hemoglobin and reduces renal excretion of free hemoglobin, preventing tubular injury. $• #Vasoocclusive symptoms:#  Patients with SCD may experience pain from hypoxic tissue injury and infarctions due to obstruction of small vessels by sickled cells.  Microvascular occlusion typically involves the bone marrow, periosteum, and deep muscles but can occur in other organs.  This patient is presenting with #dactylitis# (hand-foot syndrome), which results from small infarctions in the bones of the extremities.  These infarctions cause swelling, tenderness, and warmth.  Dactylitis is common in patients with SCD during the first few years of life as the affected bones still contain hematopoietic bone marrow.  In older children and adults, vascular occlusion leads to pain crises, acute chest syndrome, leg ulceration, priapism, autosplenectomy, and stroke. $• #Infections:# Patients with SCD are predisposed to infections with #encapsulated organisms# (eg, Streptococcus pneumoniae) because repeated splenic infarcts cause functional asplenia. $#(Choices A and E)#  The chronic anemia in SCD can result in cardiomegaly due to chronically increased cardiac output (systolic function is largely preserved due to an increase in stroke volume).  However, this typically does not occur until after infancy.  Older patients can develop congestive heart failure due to ischemic cardiomyopathy and present with decreased cardiac output and increased systemic venous pressure. $#(Choices B and F)#  Serum albumin and urine cortisol excretion are typically normal in patients with SCD. $#(Choice C)#  Hereditary angioedema is a rare autosomal dominant disorder that is associated with painless episodes of swelling involving the face, lips, larynx, and extremities.  It is caused by C1-inhibitor deficiency, not vasoocclusion. $#Educational objective# Dactylitis (painful swelling of the hands and feet) is a common presentation of sickle cell disease (SCD) in young children.

The RANK/RANKL pathway plays a prominent role.  RANK is a transmembrane receptor on the surface of osteoclast precursors, which is activated by RANK-ligand (RANKL) produced by osteocytes.  #Activation of RANK# leads to the differentiation of osteoclast precursors into mature osteoclasts. $Myeloma cells stimulate osteoclast maturation by producing RANKL and by destroying osteoprotegerin (OPG), mediated by a secreted proteoglycan.

Chronic alcohol use leads to progressive hepatic fibrosis/#cirrhosis#, resulting in acquired coagulopathy. $#Clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X# are produced initially by the liver in an inactive form and then activated by @vitamin K-dependent carboxylation@.  #Factor VII#, part of the extrinsic pathway, has the #shortest half-life# of all coagulation factors.  Prothrombin time (PT) assesses the extrinsic and common pathways of coagulation and is the first to become abnormal in liver disease.  This patient's PT prolongation is likely due to factor VII deficiency in the setting of cirrhosis.  Because clotting factor synthesis is impaired, PT may not improve with vitamin K supplementation as there are insufficient quantities of clotting factors to undergo vitamin K-dependent carboxylation/activation. $The liver also synthesizes albumin, and hypoalbuminemia results in ascites and peripheral edema.  In addition, severe cirrhosis causes high-output heart failure due to chronic splanchnic vasodilation and development of mesenteric and intrahepatic arteriovenous shunts. $#(Choice A)#  Dietary vitamin K deficiency impairs activation of factors II, VII, IX, and X.  Risk factors include severe malnourishment (eg, alcohol use disorder) and long-term antibiotic use (alters vitamin K-producing gut flora).  In vitamin K deficiency, supplementation would likely improve PT. $#(Choice C)#  In contrast to other coagulation factors, factor VIII is synthesized by endothelial cells.  As part of the intrinsic pathway, factor VIII deficiency results in prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT) with a normal PT.  Hemophilia A is an X-linked recessive disorder of factor VIII deficiency. $#(Choice D)#  Cirrhosis is associated with intrinsic platelet dysfunction and thrombocytopenia due to decreased hepatic synthesis of thrombopoietin and increased splenic platelet sequestration (secondary to hypersplenism).  Platelet dysfunction and significant thrombocytopenia (eg, platelets <50,000/mm3) lead to mucocutaneous bleeding/petechiae and prolonged bleeding time but do not affect PT. $#(Choice E)#  Von Willebrand disease causes defects in platelet adhesion and coagulation (due to associated factor VIII deficiency).  PTT may be normal or prolonged based on the level of factor VIII deficiency, and platelet aggregation to ristocetin will be abnormal. $#Education objective:# Vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors (II, VII, IX, and X) are synthesized in the liver.  Factor VII has the shortest half-life of the coagulation factors.  Failure of the prothrombin time to correct with vitamin K supplementation indicates factor VII deficiency, which is often due to underlying liver disease.  ",

VWF has 2 important @hemostatic functions@:  $1. It binds platelets to vascular subendothelial components at sites of injury (and platelets to each other), which results in the formation of hemostatic platelet plugs.  Therefore, patients with VWD have impaired platelet aggregation but #normal platelet count# (as platelet consumption/production is unaffected).  $2. VWF acts as a #carrier protein for factor VIII# and protects it from degradation.  Because factor VIII is part of the @intrinsic@ (contact activation) coagulation pathway, patients with VWD sometimes have #prolonged PTT# (due to increased destruction of factor VIII), but #PT will be normal#. $VWD is typically transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion so a #family history# of bleeding is often an important diagnostic clue.  Most cases are asymptomatic, but a minority (~1%) have easy bruising, skin bleeding, and bleeding from mucous membranes (eg, oropharyngeal, gastrointestinal, uterine).  Testing for vWF level and activity (eg, ristocetin cofactor assay) can help confirm the diagnosis. $#(Choice A)#  Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disease associated with immune-mediated platelet destruction.  Although patients with ITP often have easy bleeding, VWF levels and activity are normal, and a family history of bleeding is uncommon (as ITP is an acquired disorder).  ITP is marked by thrombocytopenia and normal PT/PTT. $#(Choice B)#  Disseminated intravascular coagulation is caused by widespread activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis due to sepsis, malignancy, trauma, or obstetric complication.  It is an acquired disorder, so a family history of bleeding is uncommon.  Disseminated intravascular coagulation is associated with low platelets and elevated PT and PTT. $#(Choice D)#  Vitamin K deficiency and warfarin use impair synthesis of vitamin K–dependent clotting factors (II, VII, IX, and X), which leads to prolonged PT and normal platelet count and PTT (PTT can sometimes be mildly elevated).  Although vitamin K deficiency is common in newborns, it is very uncommon in otherwise healthy children and adults.  In addition, the family history of bleeding disorder makes this much less likely than vWD. $#(Choice E)#  Patients with severe liver disease often have impaired hepatic synthetic function and are unable to generate sufficient quantities of clotting factors.  Therefore, they often have elevated PT and PTT (with normal or low platelets).  This otherwise healthy boy is unlikely to have significant liver disease. $#Educational objective# Von Willebrand disease is the most common inherited bleeding disorder and is usually transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion.  Symptomatic patients typically present with easy bruising and mucosal bleeding.

In this case, the peripheral blood smear demonstrates #hypochromic, microcytic erythrocytes# and a variety of erythrocyte shapes #(poikilocytosis)#, raising strong suspicion for severe @iron deficiency anemia@ (IDA).  Young women often develop IDA from heavy menstruation. $Patients with severe IDA do not have enough iron to generate adequate hemoglobin for each erythrocyte, which results in low mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (hypochromia) and small erythrocyte size (microcytosis).  Interstitial fibroblasts in the peritubular capillaries and proximal convoluted tubule of the kidney detect the reduced oxygen carrying capacity of the blood (mild tissue hypoxia) and #increase erythropoietin release# to drive the generation of new erythrocytes.  However, new erythrocytes cannot be produced at a level to compensate for the anemia due to insufficient serum iron; therefore, patients typically have #minimal reticulocytes# and #low red blood cell counts# in the peripheral blood. $#(Choice A)#  Transferrin is a serum protein that binds free iron.  The concentration of transferrin is increased in IDA (to maximize free iron scavenge), but the amount of iron bound to it is reduced, leading to a low transferrin saturation on laboratory evaluation. $#(Choices B, C, and E)#  Hepcidin is a small peptide released by the liver in response to inflammation.  It binds to and inhibits iron channels on the surface of enterocytes and on reticuloendothelial macrophages, which reduces iron absorption in the gut and reduces iron release from the reticuloendothelial system (the primary site of iron recycling).  Because IDA is not mediated by inflammation, hepcidin levels are typically low; this increases gastrointestinal iron absorption and iron release from the reticuloendothelial system (eg, splenic macrophages).  In contrast, anemia of chronic disease is associated with very high levels of hepcidin (and other inflammatory cytokines), which reduces iron availability for erythrocytosis despite adequate total body stores of iron.  Patients with anemia of chronic disease typically have normocytic anemia and normochromia (not hypochromia). $#Educational objective# Patients with severe iron deficiency anemia (IDA) typically have evidence of hypochromic, microcytic erythrocytes on peripheral blood smear with poikilocytosis.  Laboratory studies will reveal low red blood cell count, low hepcidin, and high transferrin.  Although erythropoietin is markedly elevated in IDA, there is not enough iron to efficiently generate erythrocytes; therefore, reticulocyte count is low.  ",

  "explanation_2": "#Multiple myeloma# (MM) is a lymphoproliferative malignancy characterized by monoclonal plasma cell proliferation and production of monoclonal paraproteins (eg, immunoglobulins, chain fragments).  MM should be suspected in elderly patients who have any combination of osteolytic lesions, hypercalcemia, anemia, or acute kidney injury (such as this patient).  Other common symptoms include weight loss, constipation (due to hypercalcemia), fatigue, and recurrent infection. $Kidney disease in MM is largely due to #light chain cast nephropathy# (myeloma kidney).  Intact immunoglobulins (eg, IgA, IgG, IgM) are too large to pass through the glomerulus, but a small amount of free light chains (eg, kappa, lambda) are freely filtered and resorbed in the proximal tubules.  However in MM, the excessive quantities of free light chains exceed the resorptive capacity of the kidney.  The filtered light chains then combine with Tamm-Horsfall proteins to form #obstructive casts# that cause tubular rupture and kidney injury. $Monoclonal paraproteins are #not detected by urine dipstick# (which detects only albumin), but #quantitative protein concentrations# (spot or 24-hour turbidimetric assay) will be elevated.  Urine protein electrophoresis, immunofixation, or free light chain immunoassays can be used for diagnosis. $#(Choices A, B, C, and D)#  MM can occasionally cause monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition disease, in which intact immunoglobulins or heavy and/or light chains deposit on the kidney basement membranes, resulting in glomerular disease and nephrotic syndrome.  In this case, large intact immunoglobulins (and heavy chains) can enter the urine; however, albumin (which also passes through the injured glomerulus) would be detected on urine dipstick. $#Educational objective# Multiple myeloma should be suspected in elderly patients who have any combination of osteolytic lesions, hypercalcemia, anemia, or acute kidney injury.  Renal disease is most commonly caused by light chain cast nephropathy, in which free light chains form obstructive casts in the renal tubules.  Monoclonal paraproteins are not detected by urine dipstick (which detects only albumin), but both spot and 24-hour protein concentrations will be elevated.  "

However, ACD is also commonly caused by less obvious sources of inflammation such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, severe traumatic injury, and #morbid obesity#. $The major inflammatory cytokine that drives ACD is #hepcidin#, a small peptide released from the liver in response to inflammation or bacterial lipopolysaccharide.  Hepcidin binds to and #inhibits iron channels# (ferroportin) on the surface of enterocytes and reticuloendothelial macrophages, leading to decreased iron absorption in the gut and decreased iron release by the reticuloendothelial system (which supplies ~95% of daily iron for erythropoiesis).  Because heme synthesis is impaired without sufficient iron, patients with ACD typically develop a #normocytic# (or slightly microcytic) #anemia# with a #minimal reticulocyte response#. $#(Choice B)#  Extravascular hemolysis typically occurs due to the formation of IgG autoantibodies against the erythrocyte membrane, which results in erythrocyte destruction by splenic macrophages.  Patients generally develop an acute normocytic anemia with a strong (not suppressed) reticulocyte response. $#(Choice C)#  Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia is associated with shearing of red blood cells in the microvasculature due to the formation of fibrin-rich platelet clots.  Patients typically have normocytic anemia, significant reticulocytosis, and severe thrombocytopenia (~10,000/mm3). $#(Choice D)#  Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) from an occult gastrointestinal bleed is common in older individuals.  IDA is also associated with a low reticulocyte count.  Although IDA can cause mild normocytic anemia early in the disease course, by the time individuals develop profound anemia (eg, hemoglobin of 8.6 mg/dL), they almost always have severe microcytosis (eg, MCV < 70).  This patient's severe anemia is accompanied by a normal MCV, making iron deficiency anemia highly unlikely. $#(Choice E)#  Vitamin B12 deficiency is associated with macrocytic (not normocytic) anemia due to impaired maturation of erythrocytes. $#Educational objective# Anemia of chronic disease (ACD) occurs in patients with rheumatologic diseases, chronic infection, malignancy, congestive heart failure, and morbid obesity due to chronic elevation of inflammatory cytokines.  The primary mediator is hepcidin, a peptide released from the liver that inhibits iron channels on enterocytes and reticuloendothelial macrophages.

The sharply demarcated purpuric lesion likely represents #warfarin-induced skin necrosis#, a rare complication that results from an excessive decrease in protein C activity; patients with underlying #protein C deficiency# are at increased risk. $Protein C and S are innate anticoagulants that are vitamin K dependent, as are procoagulant factors II, VII, IX, and X.  Warfarin inhibits @epoxide reductase@ (responsible for regenerating vitamin K), which leads to decreased levels of these proteins.  Factor VII and #protein C# are #depleted first# due to their shorter half-life.  The early loss of protein C activity relative to procoagulant factor activity leads to a #transient hypercoagulable state# that persists until the other procoagulant factors are @sufficiently inhibited@.  In patients with protein C deficiency, this procoagulant state is exaggerated, promoting #microvasculature occlusion# and hemorrhagic skin necrosis.  Underlying protein S deficiency also increases the risk of warfarin-induced skin necrosis, though not to the same extent. $Treatment of warfarin-induced skin necrosis includes discontinuing warfarin and administering fresh frozen plasma or protein C concentrate.  The condition may be prevented by the coadministration of heparin during the first several days of warfarin therapy. $#(Choice A)#  Allergic drug reactions are immune-mediated hypersensitivity reactions that can have variable cutaneous findings ranging from diffuse erythematous eruptions to extensive blistering and exfoliation (eg, Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis); this patient's recent warfarin use and localized skin findings are more suggestive of warfarin-induced skin necrosis. $#(Choice B)#  Antithrombin deficiency can be inherited (autosomal dominant) or acquired (eg, cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome) and presents with venous thromboembolism (eg, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) and resistance to heparin.  Warfarin does not affect antithrombin activity. $#(Choice C)#  Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is an autoimmune phenomenon that causes arterial and venous thrombosis.  It can produce skin findings similar to this patient's but would generally be associated with thrombocytopenia and recent heparin use. $#(Choice E)#  Vitamin K deficiency most often occurs in patients with fat malabsorption or those taking broad-spectrum antibiotics.  The deficiency increases the inhibitory effect of warfarin on all vitamin K-dependent proteins (both anticoagulant and procoagulant), so it does not alter the relative coagulability balance to encourage warfarin-induced skin necrosis. $#Education objective:# Patients started on warfarin develop a transient hypercoagulable state due to the short half-life of protein C.  This hypercoagulability is further exaggerated by preexisting protein C deficiency and can result in thrombotic occlusion of the microvasculature with skin necrosis.  ",

In general, enzyme deficiencies in the early steps of porphyrin synthesis cause neurovisceral symptoms (acute porphyrias); deficiencies in the latter steps (after condensation of PBG to HMB) result in photosensitivity (cutaneous porphyrias). $AIP is an acute porphyria that causes nervous system dysfunction due to the accumulation of early heme pathway intermediates (PBG and delta-aminolevulinic acid [ALA]).  It presents #acutely# with variable #gastrointestinal and neurologic symptoms#, most commonly abdominal pain, vomiting, peripheral neuropathy, and neuropsychiatric derangements.  A key feature of acute porphyrias is @reddish urine@ that darkens on exposure to light and air due to the oxidation of excess PBG. $Treatment and prevention of acute porphyria attacks is directed at #inhibiting ALA synthase #(the rate-limiting enzyme of heme synthesis) to reduce formation of the toxic intermediate metabolites.  ALA synthase is upregulated by #CYP450 inducers# (eg, most antiepileptics, griseofulvin, rifampin) and downregulated by #heme# and #glucose#.  As such, avoidance of alcohol, smoking, and other CYP450-inducing drugs is important for preventing acute attacks.  Likewise, intravenous heme administration and carbohydrate loading (such as with dextrose infusion) are useful for ameliorating acute symptoms. $#(Choices A, B, C, E, and F)#  Administration of intravenous dextrose inhibits peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma, a transcription factor that induces synthesis of ALA synthase.  This improves the symptoms of AIP by reducing the overall activity of the porphyrin synthesis pathway. $#Educational objective# Acute intermittent porphyria is an autosomal dominant condition caused by porphobilinogen deaminase deficiency.  Most patients remain asymptomatic, but a minority present with acute attacks characterized by abdominal pain and vomiting, peripheral neuropathy, neuropsychological symptoms, and reddish-brown urine.  Treatment consists of intravenous glucose or heme preparations, which downregulate ALA synthase activity.  ",

She has a normal hematocrit, leukocyte count and differential, fibrinogen level, and prothrombin time/International Normalized Ratio.  She takes no medications, and there is no obvious hepatosplenomegaly on physical examination.  Taken together, these findings suggest an isolated acquired thrombocytopenia. $Common causes of acquired thrombocytopenia include increased platelet consumption, sequestration, and/or destruction.  In this patient, primary #immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)# is the most likely diagnosis as, other than thrombocytopenia (with associated ecchymosis), her physical examination and laboratory findings are unremarkable.  ITP is characterized by the #autoimmune# destruction of platelets by anti-platelet antibodies, likely IgG autoantibodies against the platelet membrane glycoproteins GPIIb/IIIa.  In children, ITP is typically acute and self-limited, whereas it tends to run an insidious and chronic course in adults.  A peripheral blood smear with #isolated# thrombocytopenia and no other platelet abnormalities would help confirm the diagnosis (megakaryocytes can sometimes be seen).  Treatment involves systemic immunosuppression (corticosteroids).  Secondary ITP is sometimes associated with HIV or hepatitis C infection. $#(Choice A)#  Bone marrow aplasia would cause pancytopenia.  It is unlikely that this patient's thrombocytopenia is due to bone marrow failure as the peripheral counts of the hematopoietic cell lines, other than platelets, are normal.  Common causes of aplastic anemia include parvovirus and Epstein-Barr virus infections, high-dose chemotherapy, and radiation. $#(Choice B)#  Malignant infiltration of the bone marrow would be expected to cause pancytopenia and extramedullary hematopoiesis within the liver and spleen, leading to hepatosplenomegaly. $#(Choice C)#  If this patient were experiencing accelerated platelet consumption due to disseminated intravascular coagulation, the plasma fibrinogen level would be decreased and the prothrombin time would be elevated due to clotting factor consumption. $#(Choice E)#  Splenic sequestration of platelets typically occurs in disorders that produce splenomegaly, such as portal hypertension; the platelet count usually remains >30,000/mm3, and abnormal bleeding generally does not occur.  Although platelets can undergo splenic sequestration in ITP, the primary mechanism responsible for the thrombocytopenia is immune destruction. $#(Choice F)#  In von Willebrand disease, platelet function is impaired because von Willebrand factor, which normally facilitates platelet binding to damaged endothelium, is deficient.  The platelet count would be normal (unlike in this patient), and the bleeding time and partial thromboplastin time would be prolonged. $#Educational objective# Autoimmune platelet destruction is a common cause of thrombocytopenia and should be suspected in patients with ecchymoses, petechiae, mucosal bleeding, and no other obvious causes of thrombocytopenia (eg, medications, bone marrow failure).

These nodes are commonly enlarged with infections affecting the oral cavity, including dental infections and common viral infections (eg, coxsackievirus). $#Educational objective# Lymph node enlargement is most commonly due to infection-triggered cellular proliferation but can be caused by clonal expansion of malignant cells.  Enlargement of the supraclavicular lymph nodes, which drain the chest and abdomen, is unlikely to be caused by common childhood infections and is concerning for malignancy.  "

  "explanation_2": "$Beginning around age 6 months, term infants are at risk for developing iron deficiency.  They are typically born with enough iron required for the first few months of life.  As iron is lost steadily by shedding epithelium (eg, skin, intestinal tract), it must be replenished through dietary intake; newborns also require additional iron to support rapid body growth.  Breastmilk contains only a low concentration of iron.  Therefore, breastfed infants who do not receive additional iron-rich foods are at risk for developing iron deficiency. $Iron deficiency progresses through the following stages:  $1. #Decreased iron storage#:  When there is a net negative iron balance, iron is first removed from the storage pool (eg, hepatocytes, reticuloendothelial system); iron is stored intracellularly within ferritin complexes.  Ferritin is also found in the blood, and serum levels generally fluctuate in proportion to iron stores.  Therefore, the body's depletion of storage iron can be detected through a #low serum ferritin level#.  $2. #Iron-limited erythropoiesis#:  As iron stores become depleted, serum iron levels decrease, followed by a compensatory #rise in transferrin# and a resultant decrease in transferrin saturation #(choice E).#  During this phase, there is iron-limited erythropoiesis, in which newly made erythrocytes (ie, reticulocytes) are iron deficient and reticulocyte production may begin to be limited.  Because mature erythrocytes have a slow turnover (ie, 120 days), most cells sampled during this stage still have normal morphology, and the total hemoglobin value may still be normal.  $3. #Iron deficiency anemia#:  If iron deficiency continues, the last phase is frank iron deficiency anemia, which is reflected by a low hemoglobin level with #microcytosis# (low mean corpuscular volume [MCV]) and #hypochromia# (low mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration [MCHC]) in most erythrocytes #(choices B and C)#.  Reticulocyte production decreases, resulting in an inappropriately low number of reticulocytes #(choice D).# $Therefore, a patient in the earliest stages of iron deficiency anemia would likely have only decreased ferritin with an otherwise normal transferrin saturation, MCV, MCHC, and reticulocyte count. $#Educational objective# Infants who do not receive adequate iron supplementation are at risk for developing iron deficiency, which progresses in stages as total body iron is depleted.  The earliest stage involves loss of iron in storage (decreased serum ferritin), followed by iron-limited erythropoiesis with decreased serum iron and transferrin saturation.  Frank iron deficiency anemia, involving the classic findings of low hemoglobin, microcytic/hypochromic erythrocytes, and a low reticulocyte count, is a late finding.  "

These findings are suggestive of #platelet dysfunction#, a common cause of easy bruising and mucosal bleeding in patients with CKD. $Normally, primary hemostasis consists of the formation of a @platelet plug@.  This process begins with binding of von Willebrand factor (vWF) to the denuded endothelium after injury; vWF creates a bridge between subendothelial collagen and platelets (#adhesion#).

Patients with CKD have elevated urea, the end product of @ammonia breakdown@, which is derived from arginine.  As urea levels rise, arginine and its precursors are shunted to a different pathway, instead producing guanidinosuccinic acid (GSA), a precursor to nitric oxide.

The lack of a cell wall makes this pathogen resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. $#(Choice B)#  Malaria and babesiosis are associated with intraerythrocytic organisms that can cause cell lysis and anemia.  However, these pathogens usually cause high fever and more severe clinical syndromes.  In addition, azithromycin monotherapy is not an effective cure for these infections. $#(Choice D)#  Iron deficiency anemia, which is most commonly due to blood loss, can often be improved by replenishing body iron stores (eg, oral iron supplementation).  Chronic infection or inflammatory conditions can be associated with anemia of chronic disease, which is due to impaired utilization of iron (not absolute iron deficiency). $#(Choice E)#  Enzyme deficiencies that cause anemia include glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and pyruvate kinase deficiency.  Infection and medications that cause oxidative stress (eg, sulfonamides, antimalarial agents) can cause hemolysis in patients with G6PD; however, G6PD is an X-linked disorder (it is seen in men). $#Educational objective# Mycoplasma pneumoniae binds an oligosaccharide on the respiratory epithelium that is also present on erythrocytes, leading to the generation of cross-reacting IgM antibodies (cold agglutinins).  Patients with M pneumoniae infections often develop mild, transient hemolytic anemia that resolves as IgM antibody titers decline (6-8 weeks after infection begins).  "

CO poisoning can occur after exposure to automobile exhaust (especially in older cars without catalytic converters), fire smoke, or improperly vented natural gas appliances.  CO has 2 major effects on oxygen delivery to tissues:  $1. CO binds to hemoglobin with an affinity approximately 250 times that of oxygen, reducing the number of heme binding sites available to oxygen.  As a result, levels of CO-bound hemoglobin, represented by #carboxyhemoglobin# (HBCO), #increase#.  By decreasing the fraction of hemoglobin available for oxygen binding, CO decreases the oxygen-carrying capacity and #oxygen content# of blood, but #not# the amount of oxygen #dissolved# in plasma, reflected by the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2).  $2. CO poisoning causes a #leftward# shift of the hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve, reflecting a decreased tendency for oxygen to unload in the tissues. $CO's effects on arterial blood oxygen content are seen in the graphs below, which show the lower oxygen content with CO poisoning (similar to anemia) and the leftward shift of the dissociation curve that becomes increasingly more pronounced at increasingly higher HBCO concentrations (this does not occur with anemia).$  ",

It also reduces oxygen unloading from hemoglobin in the tissues.  CO poisoning increases carboxyhemoglobin concentrations but does not affect the partial pressure of oxygen and does not precipitate methemoglobinemia.  "

Therefore, initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy often leads to massive lysis of tumor cells, which spills intracellular contents into the blood (#tumor lysis syndrome#), resulting in the following: $• #Hyperphosphatemia:# Intracellular phosphate concentration is much higher than serum phosphate levels.  Therefore, serum phosphate levels typically spike following chemotherapy initiation.  Because excess phosphate is excreted via the kidneys, patients are at risk for calcium-phosphate deposition in the renal tubules and collecting system, which can lead to hypocalcemia and acute renal failure. $• #Hyperuricemia:# Purine nucleic acids released from lysed tumor cells are metabolized by xanthine oxidase into @uric acid@.  Because uric acid is excreted through the kidneys and is poorly soluble, patients are at risk for obstructing uric acid stones, which can lead to acute renal injury. $• #Hyperkalemia:# Potassium is primarily an intracellular ion.

  "explanation_2": "$In a patient with erythrocytosis, the following tests can help determine the cause: $1. #Absolute versus relative erythrocytosis#:  Hemoglobin and hematocrit levels cannot accurately differentiate these conditions.  Direct measurement of the RBC mass is necessary.  An increased total RBC mass indicates an absolute erythrocytosis; a normal RBC mass indicates a relative erythrocytosis.  This patient does not have an increased RBC mass and is likely experiencing relative erythrocytosis due to aggressive diuretic therapy for her heart failure exacerbation. $2. #Primary versus secondary erythrocytosis#:  Serum erythropoietin levels can be used to differentiate primary from secondary erythrocytosis.  Primary erythrocytosis is associated with low erythropoietin levels and is caused by myeloproliferative disorders such as polycythemia vera.  Secondary erythrocytosis is characterized by increased erythropoietin levels due to chronic hypoxia from high altitudes, smoking, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; or abnormal secretion by neoplastic or otherwise diseased tissues. $3. #Hypoxic versus other causes of secondary erythrocytosis#:  Measurement of the arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) is important to exclude hypoxemia as a cause of the erythrocytosis.  SaO2 < 92% (PaO2 < 65 mm Hg) can cause secondary polycythemia.  SaO2 (measured as a percentage) should not be confused with PaO2 (measured as a partial pressure in mm Hg). $#(Choice A)#  Polycythemia vera is a myeloproliferative disorder associated with marked erythrocytosis and more modest increases in granulocytes and platelets.  A low erythropoietin level is characteristic, along with increased RBC mass. $#(Choice B)#  Hypoxia is a common cause of secondary erythrocytosis.  SaO2 < 92% (PaO2 < 65 mm Hg) appears to be the threshold for the development of secondary erythrocytosis.  This patient has hypoxemia above this threshold, an acute (< 3 day) increase in hematocrit, and normal RBC mass; none of these features are consistent with hypoxemia-induced erythrocytosis. $#(Choices C and D)#  Occasionally, renal disease or occult neoplasia can cause secondary erythrocytosis due to abnormal erythropoietin production by the diseased tissue.  Work-up will reveal an increased RBC mass and an increased erythropoietin level.  However, chronic renal disease typically leads to decreased erythropoietin production. $#Educational objective# Erythrocytosis is defined as a hematocrit level > 52% in men and > 48% in women.

High iron levels and inflammatory conditions increase the synthesis of hepcidin, while hypoxia and increased erythropoiesis act to lower hepcidin levels.  Hepcidin influences body iron storage through its interaction with #ferroportin#, a transmembrane protein responsible for transferring intracellular iron to the circulation.  Upon binding hepcidin, ferroportin is internalized and degraded, decreasing intestinal iron absorption and inhibiting the release of iron by macrophages. $Regulation of intestinal iron absorption is crucial for maintaining iron homeostasis, since blood loss is the only way of removing large amounts of iron from the body.  Iron absorption from the proximal small intestine is facilitated by the divalent metal transporter-1 (DMT-1).  Once inside the intestinal cells, iron may take 1 of 2 paths:  $1. Iron may bind to ferritin (a primarily intracellular iron-binding protein) and remain stored within the enterocyte.  The stored iron is excreted in the stool as enterocytes slough off and are replaced  $2. Iron may enter the circulation through ferroportin, the basolateral iron transporter of the enterocyte.  Free iron released into the circulation is transported throughout the body by transferrin (an iron-binding transport protein), which becomes internalized after interacting with transferrin receptors present on all cells $#(Choices A and B)#  When senescent red blood cells are destroyed by macrophages, the iron is recycled by the reticuloendothelial system for use in new erythroid precursors.  Iron released by macrophages under the governance of hepcidin binds rapidly to transferrin and is delivered to the bone marrow, where erythroid precursors use it to synthesize hemoglobin.  This internal iron cycle conserves the body's iron very efficiently, and only small amounts of additional iron are required for daily red cell production in the absence of significant blood loss. $#(Choice D)#  Enterocytes store iron for excretion in the feces or transport it into the circulation depending on circulating levels of the polypeptide hormone hepcidin.  Lower hepcidin levels favor iron absorption and accumulation in the body. $#(Choice E)#  Renal tubular cells play a limited role in iron metabolism by secreting lactoferrin, which binds to free iron in the urine and possibly recovers it for metabolic use. $#Educational objective# Hepcidin is synthesized by the liver that acts as the central regulator of iron homeostasis.  High iron levels and inflammatory conditions increase the synthesis of hepcidin; hypoxia and increased erythropoiesis act to lower hepcidin levels.

Therefore, small changes in the radius result in large changes in flow rate: A 19% increase in radius doubles the flow rate (1.19⁴ = 2); similarly, doubling the radius multiplies the flow rate by 16-fold (2⁴= 16). $#(Choice B)#  Doubling the length doubles the resistance, resulting in half the flow.  To achieve the equivalent flow of doubling the diameter, the length would need to be shortened to 1/16 of the original.  For this reason, shorter catheters are preferred for rapid transfusion (eg, a large-bore peripheral [L = 2 cm] is preferred over a central venous catheter [L = 20 cm]). $#(Choice C)#  Doubling the pressure results in double the flow.  To achieve the equivalent flow of doubling the radius, the infusion pressure would need to be increased by a factor of 16.  Although it is possible to transfuse blood at high pressure, doing so risks hemolyzing the blood or blowing out the intravenous site. $#(Choice D)#  If the radius, length, and pressure are kept constant, placing a second identical catheter would result in double the flow.  To achieve the equivalent flow of doubling the radius, an additional 15 catheters would need to be inserted.  For this reason, a few low-resistance intravenous access sites (eg, 2 large-bore peripheral intravenous catheters) are preferable to many high-resistance sites. $#Educational objective# The most important determinant of intravenous infusion rate is the radius (diameter) of the intravenous catheter.  For patients requiring a rapid blood transfusion, the shortest possible catheter with the widest possible diameter (eg, a large-bore peripheral intravenous catheter) should be selected. "

EPO is released into the bloodstream in response to renal tissue hypoxia and subsequently acts on erythrocyte progenitor cells (erythroid colony–forming unit cells) in the bone marrow to reduce apoptosis and increase #differentiation# into mature red blood cells. $Although healthy individuals respond to anemia by increasing EPO levels up to 10,000-fold, patients with CKD have chronic inflammatory damage to renal EPO-producing cells and are often unable to generate sufficient levels of EPO to maintain adequate erythrocytosis.  These individuals are often treated with #synthetic forms of EPO# (eg, epoetin, darbepoetin) to supplement intrinsic EPO production and stimulate erythropoiesis.  Because synthetic forms of EPO can rapidly deplete iron stores (due to increased red blood cell production), patients should be tested for iron deficiency prior to treatment with these agents. $#(Choice A)#  Protoporphyrins (heme precursors) are elevated in patients with iron deficiency anemia.  Treatment of iron deficiency anemia (eg, iron supplementation) leads to the conversion of protoporphyrins to heme, thereby reducing free protoporphyrin levels.  Patients with iron deficiency anemia usually have low serum ferritin levels and transferrin saturation. $#(Choice B)#  Warm @autoimmune hemolytic anemia@ is characterized by antibodies against antigens on the red cell membrane that result in phagocytosis in the reticuloendothelial system (eg, spleen).  Autoimmune hemolytic anemia is usually treated with immune-suppressing agents (eg, prednisone), which blunt antibody production and reduce red cell destruction.  This patient with a normal bilirubin level is unlikely to have hemolytic anemia. $#(Choice D)#  Sickle cell anemia is caused by mutations in the beta globin chain, which results in the polymerization of deoxygenated hemoglobin molecules (\"sickling\").  Treatment with hydroxyurea induces expression of fetal hemoglobin (which is unaffected by the sickle mutation) over adult hemoglobin, thereby preventing polymerization of hemoglobin molecules. $#(Choice E)#  Deficiency of vitamin B12/folate (megaloblastic anemia) impairs nucleic acid metabolism, which results in slowed production of erythrocyte precursors in the bone marrow.  Replacement of vitamin B12/folate corrects the anemia by improving nuclear maturation.  Megaloblastic anemia is typically associated with macrocytic (elevated mean corpuscular volume) anemia. $#Educational objective# Erythropoietin (EPO) is produced by peritubular fibroblast cells in the renal cortex in response to decreased renal oxygen delivery.  EPO acts on erythrocyte precursors in the bone marrow to increase red blood cell production.  Patients with chronic kidney disease often have damage to renal EPO-producing cells, which results in normocytic anemia.  ",

  "explanation_2": "$@Hemoglobin electrophoresis@ is used to assess for different forms of hemoglobin in patients with suspected hemoglobinopathy.  Normal hemoglobin consists primarily of #hemoglobin A# (HbA), which #migrates rapidly# toward the positive electrode (anode) because of its negative charge.  Hemoglobin S (HbS) is an abnormal type of hemoglobin in which a nonpolar amino acid (valine) replaces a negatively charged amino acid (glutamate) in the beta globin chain.  This amino acid replacement decreases the negative charge on the HbS molecule, which causes #HbS# to move more #slowly# toward the anode.  Similarly, hemoglobin C (HbC) has a glutamate residue replaced by lysine in the beta globin chain.  Because lysine is a positively charged amino acid, #HbC# has even less total negative charge than HbS and moves #even more slowly# toward the anode.  Both HbC and HbS result from #missense mutations#, a type of mutation in which a single base substitution results in a codon that codes for a different amino acid. $Patients with sickle cell disease have HbS mutations in both beta chains; those with HbC disease have HbC mutations involving both beta chains.  Patients with hemoglobin SC disease have 1 HbS allele and 1 HbC allele and will have 2 hemoglobin bands on electrophoresis.  This patient's electrophoresis results show a #single band# that #migrates less than the HbA and HbS# bands, meaning that he has #HbC disease#.  Patients with HbC disease are typically asymptomatic and often have mild hemolytic anemia and splenomegaly. $#(Choice A)#  Deletions involving the alpha globin genes cause alpha thalassemia, which results in imbalanced beta chain production and formation of beta tetramers (hemoglobin H) that migrate further than HbA during electrophoresis. $#(Choice C)#  Nonsense mutations introduce a stop codon within gene sequences, resulting in the formation of truncated proteins.  As a result of their decreased size, these proteins tend to move further during electrophoresis. $#(Choice D)#  Silent mutations are point mutations that have no effect on the protein formed.  A mutation from UCA to UCC does not result in any change in protein structure as both codons result in the placement of serine into the growing polypeptide chain. $#(Choice E)#  Trinucleotide expansions increase the number of trinucleotide repeats within a gene, resulting in large, unstable proteins or alterations in the epigenetic effects.  These proteins would tend to move less during electrophoresis due to their increased size.  However, the hemoglobinopathies are not caused by trinucleotide expansions, as the hemoglobin genes do not contain trinucleotide repeat regions. $#Educational objective# Hemoglobin C is caused by a missense mutation that results in a glutamate residue being substituted by lysine in the beta globin chain.  This results in an overall decrease in negative charge for the hemoglobin molecule.  The speed of hemoglobin movement during gel electrophoresis is hemoglobin A > hemoglobin S > hemoglobin C.  ",

Following endothelial damage, vWF #binds GP Ib receptors# on the platelet membrane and mediates #platelet adhesion# to subendothelial collagen.  Deficiency of vWF impairs platelet adhesion and can lead to easy bruising and #prolonged mucocutaneous bleeding# (eg, gingival bleeding, heavy menses). $Laboratory workup in vWF deficiency reveals a normal platelet count and an #abnormal ristocetin cofactor assay#.  The ristocetin cofactor assay measures in-vitro, vWF-dependent platelet agglutination (indicative of impaired platelet adhesion in-vivo).  Ristocetin activates GP Ib receptors on platelets and makes them available for vWF binding; when the vWF level is decreased, there is #poor platelet agglutination in the presence of ristocetin#.  When normal plasma that contains vWF is added, appropriate platelet agglutination occurs. $VWF also serves as a #carrier for factor VIII# to prolong its half-life, and vWF deficiency can lead to functional deficiency of factor VIII that further contributes to bleeding complications.  PTT may be normal or prolonged depending on the degree of factor VIII impairment. $Combined oral contraceptives are often used for treatment of menorrhagia due to vWF deficiency.  Patients can also be treated with desmopressin, which stimulates vWF release from endothelium. $#(Choice A)#  Bernard-Soulier syndrome (hereditary deficiency of GP Ib receptors) is characterized by thrombocytopenia, enlarged platelets, and mucocutaneous bleeding.  Platelet agglutination to ristocetin will be abnormal and, because the deficiency is with GP Ib receptors and not vWF, the addition of normal plasma will not correct the agglutination. $#(Choice B)#  Hereditary deficiency of GP IIb/IIIa receptors occurs in Glanzmann thrombasthenia, which manifests with mucocutaneous bleeding.  Platelet agglutination in response to ristocetin is normal because the levels of vWF and GP Ib receptors are normal. $#(Choice C)#  Congenital deficiency of factor XII (Hageman) causes marked PTT prolongation; however, it does not cause clinical bleeding complications.  Instead, patients may have a tendency for thromboembolic complications for unclear reasons. $#(Choice D)#  Thromboxane A2 deficiency is associated with aspirin treatment due to irreversible inactivation of cyclooxygenase in platelets.  The major effect is on GP IIb/IIIa-mediated platelet aggregation rather than GP Ib-mediated platelet adhesion; therefore, platelet agglutination to ristocetin is normal. $#Educational objective# Following endothelial damage, von Willebrand factor (vWF) binds glycoprotein Ib receptors on platelets to mediate platelet adherence.  The ristocetin cofactor assay measures platelet agglutination via binding of glycoprotein Ib receptors to vWF; it will be abnormal in vWF deficiency but will correct with the addition of normal (vWF-containing) plasma.

However, erythrocytes can bypass this part of the pathway using #bisphosphoglycerate mutase#, an enzyme that converts 1,3-BPG to #2,3-BPG# in a step that produces #no ATP#.  2,3-BPG is subsequently catabolized to 3-phosphoglycerate by bisphosphoglycerate phosphatase in a step that also yields no ATP.

  "explanation_2": "$In adults, hemoglobin A is the predominant form of hemoglobin.  It is a tetramer consisting of two alpha and two beta chains.  Normally the synthesis of alpha and beta chains is tightly regulated such that one α-chain is synthesized for every β-chain.  Hemoglobin formation begins within a few weeks of conception.  The initial hemoglobin formed by a fetus in utero is called embryonic hemoglobin (Gower).  This hemoglobin is composed of two zeta (ζ) and two epsilon (ε) chains (ζ2ε2) and is produced in the embryonic yolk sac.  Within a few weeks the fetal liver starts synthesizing hemoglobin F (fetal hemoglobin).  This form of hemoglobin is composed of two alpha and two gamma chains (α2γ2).  HbF is the major hemoglobin in the fetus during last few months of gestation and in infants during first few weeks of postnatal life.  HbA synthesis starts during the final month of gestation and gradually replaces HbF during postnatal life.  Knowing the chronology of fetal hemoglobin formation and the gradual transition to adult hemoglobin (HbA) is important in understanding the relationship between clinical manifestations and postnatal age in beta thalassemia. $Thalassemias are hereditary hemolytic anemias resulting from defective synthesis of globin chains.  As described above, the synthesis of alpha and beta globin chains is very coordinated.  In patients with thalassemia, the synthesis of either alpha or beta chains is defective.  Beta thalassemia is caused by defective synthesis of beta chains.  There are two copies of the beta globin gene (one from each parent).  If only one gene is defective the patient will have beta thalassemia trait (beta thalassemia minor) and lack significant anemia.  A defect in both beta globin genes results in severe hemolytic anemia known as beta thalassemia major.  In this disease, alpha chains are produced normally but they cannot form stable tetramers due to the lack of beta globin chains.  This failure to form stable hemoglobin leads to precipitation of alpha globin chains and premature lysis of red blood cells.  Beta thalassemia cannot become symptomatic as long as there are significant amounts of gamma chains present because gamma chains make up for the absence of HbA beta chains in forming tetramers.  Thus, in late gestation and early postnatal life, the expression of hemoglobin A is offset by gamma chain production #(choice C).#  As gamma chain production wanes, patients will become symptomatic. $#(Choice A)# α-globin is a normal component of both HbA and HbF.  α-globin synthesis is defective in α-thalassemia but it is normal in β-thalassemia.  α-globin is able to combine with γ-globin to form HbF.  This allows patients with β-thalassemia major to be asymptomatic in utero and in the first few months following birth. $#(Choice B)# β-globin synthesis is defective in patients with b-thalassemia. $#(Choice D)# δ-globin is a minor globin gene that is expressed at very low levels in normal adults.  Two α-globins and two δ-globins combine to form hemoglobin A2. $#(Choice E)# ζ-globin is a component of hemoglobin Gower, the initial hemoglobin formed by the embryo very early in embryogenesis. $#Educational objective# HbF contains γ-globin instead of β-globin.  Patients with homozygotic β-thalassemia (β-thalassemia major) are asymptomatic at birth due to the presence of γ-globins and HbF.  Switching to HbA production and the cessation of  γ-globin synthesis precipitates the symptoms of β-thalassemia.  "

Oxygen saturation increases in a sigmoidal fashion as the pO2 increases because of the increase in oxygen-binding affinity that occurs after the first oxygen molecule binds to hemoglobin.  As more oxygen molecules bind to hemoglobin, the number of available binding sites decreases and the curve eventually flattens out. $The partial pressure of oxygen in the blood at which hemoglobin is 50% saturated is known as the P50 (dotted black line in diagram above); this value is a standard measure of hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen and is about 26 mm Hg in normal individuals.

However, small quantities of other @hemoglobin types@ are also present; these include hemoglobin A2 (HbA2), which contains a pair of alpha and delta globins, and hemoglobin F (HbF), which contains a pair of alpha and gamma globins. $In #homozygous sickle cell disease# (sickle cell anemia), there are point mutations in both beta globin genes that substitute valine for glutamate at position 6.  This generates a new type of hemoglobin called #hemoglobin S# (HbS), which is composed of a pair of alpha and a pair of beta sickle globins.  HbS @polymerizes when deoxygenated@, reducing erythrocyte deformability and promoting painful vasoocclusion and chronic hemolysis. $Because patients with sickle cell anemia have mutations in both beta globin genes, they are #unable to produce HbA (choices B, C, and D)#.  However, forms of normal hemoglobin that do not contain beta globin (eg, HbF, HbA2) are present at normal or mildly increased levels.  Raising the concentration of these normal hemoglobins is particularly helpful because it dilutes HbS, preventing it from polymerizing.  Therefore, #hydroxyurea#, which #increases HbF# production, is often administered to limit symptoms and complications of the disease. $#(Choice E)#  Patients with hemoglobin SC disease have 1 beta globin with the sickle mutation and 1 beta globin with a mutation that substitutes lysine for glutamate at position 6.  They produce two predominant hemoglobins: HbS and Hemoglobin C, the latter of which is not seen in sickle cell anemia as there is no hemoglobin C mutation. $#Educational objective# Homozygous sickle cell disease is marked by a point mutation in both beta globin genes.  This leads to the generation of a new predominant hemoglobin called hemoglobin S (HbS), which polymerizes when deoxygenated.  Because hemoglobin F (HbF) prevents HbS polymerization, hydroxyurea is often administered to increase HbF levels and reduce complications of the disease.  ",

  "explanation_2": "$The #oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve# describes the relationship between the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood and the oxygen saturation of hemoglobin.  The partial pressure of oxygen at which hemoglobin is 50% saturated (#P₅₀#) is a value used as a conventional measure of hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen.  The P₅₀ is about 26 mm Hg in normal individuals.  A P₅₀ #shift from 26 to 20 mm Hg# indicates that the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen is increased (left shift of the oxygen dissociation curve). $Mutations that cause production of hemoglobin with #high oxygen affinity# (eg, hemoglobins Chesapeake and Kempsey) reduce the ability of hemoglobin to release oxygen within the peripheral tissues.  Low oxygen levels stimulate the kidneys to increase erythropoietin synthesis, which results in a #compensatory erythrocytosis# that helps maintain normal oxygen delivery.  Therefore, patients with high oxygen affinity hemoglobins are typically asymptomatic. $#(Choice B)#  Sickle cell disease can result in hypoxia-induced hemolysis due to the ability of deoxygenated hemoglobin S to polymerize and cause excessive erythrocyte sickling and irreversible cell membrane damage.  The oxygen dissociation curve for hemoglobin S is shifted to the right (↓ oxygen affinity) due to the stabilizing effects of polymerization on the deoxygenated form. $#(Choice C)#  Hereditary spherocytosis results from a variety of molecular defects involving erythrocyte structural proteins responsible for linking the plasma membrane to the cytoskeleton (eg, spectrin, ankyrin).  The resulting membrane instability leads to the formation of spherocytes – small, rounded erythrocytes with increased susceptibility to lyse in hypotonic solutions. $#(Choice D)#  Megaloblastic erythrocyte changes (↑ MCV) are characteristically seen in vitamin B12 and folic acid deficiency due to impaired DNA synthesis. $#(Choice E)#  Individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency develop rapid hemolysis during periods of increased oxidant stress, such as when taking antimalarials or sulfonamides or after ingestion of fava beans. $#Educational objective# P₅₀ refers to the partial pressure of oxygen at which hemoglobin is 50% saturated.  Hemoglobins with high oxygen affinity have a decreased P₅₀ that is represented by a leftward shift of the oxygen dissociation curve.  The reduced ability to release oxygen within the peripheral tissues leads to renal hypoxia, increased erythropoietin synthesis, and compensatory erythrocytosis.  "

This single glu → val substitution leads to the formation of a #hydrophobic pocket# on the beta globin surface that interacts with a complementary nonpolar residue on another hemoglobin molecule.  The hydrophobic interaction causes #polymerization# of HbS molecules and subsequent #erythrocyte sickling#, leading to membrane damage and permanent distortion of red blood cells.  Red cell sickling is promoted by low oxygen levels, increased acidity, and dehydration. $In patients with hemoglobin C (#HbC#), glu is replaced by a basic #polar# (positively charged) #lysine# (lys) residue.  Because lys is charged (although it has opposite polarity to glu), there is no hydrophobic interaction between hemoglobin molecules and no polymerization/sickling.  However, the positive charge of lys causes HbC to have decreased mobility on electrophoresis. $#(Choice B)#  HbS and HbC do not differ significantly from normal hemoglobin in affinity to 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG).  In addition, weaker interaction with 2,3-BPG would lead to increased oxygen affinity (left shift of the @oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve@), which would help ameliorate sickling. $#(Choice C)#  The ability of HbS to polymerize helps stabilize the deoxygenated form, causing a right shift of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve that facilitates oxygen unloading.  In contrast, impaired oxygen unloading occurs with carboxyhemoglobin due to an allosteric change that increases the affinity of the remaining 3 oxygen-binding sites. $#(Choice D)#  A glu → val substitution affects the 3-dimensional (tertiary) structure of hemoglobin, but it does not result in a significant change in the alpha helical (secondary) structure.  Introducing proline into the primary structure could distort the alpha helix due to proline's rigid cyclic structure. $#(Choice E)#  HbS and HbC mutations do not involve amino acids lining the heme pocket.  Heme iron oxidation (ferrous [Fe²⁺] → ferric [Fe³⁺]) results in methemoglobin formation.  Hemoglobin M disease is a congenital cause of methemoglobinemia due to a mutation in the heme-binding pocket. $#Educational objective# Hemoglobin S (HbS) contains valine in place of glutamic acid at the sixth amino acid position of the beta globin chain.  This promotes hydrophobic interaction among Hb molecules and results in HbS polymerization and erythrocyte sickling.  ",

  "explanation_2": "$In #sickle cell (hemoglobin S [HbS]) anemia#, the nonpolar amino acid valine replaces the charged amino acid glutamate at position 6 of the β globin chain.  This results in the alteration of a hydrophobic portion of the β globin chain that fits into a complementary site on the α globin chain of another hemoglobin molecule.  As a result, hemoglobin molecules aggregate under anoxic conditions.  After polymerization, HbS initially forms a gel and then a meshwork of fibrous polymers causing the red blood cells to distort into an abnormal sickle shape. $#Sickling# is promoted by conditions associated with #low oxygen# levels, increased acidity, or low blood volume (dehydration).  Sickled cells are not flexible enough to pass through microvasculature.  As a result, they impede blood flow and cause microinfarcts in tissues and painful vasoocclusive crises.  Organs in which blood moves slowly (eg, spleen, liver) are predisposed to lower oxygen levels or acidity.  Organs with particularly high metabolic demands (eg, brain, muscles, placenta) promote sickling by extracting more oxygen from the blood (#oxygen unloading#).  The sickling process is complex and incompletely understood. $#(Choices A and C)#  The molecule 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) binds the 2 β globin chains ionically and stabilizes the taut (T) deoxyhemoglobin.  This binding decreases hemoglobin's oxygen affinity, facilitating oxygen release at the tissue level.  With 2,3-BPG depletion, hemoglobin affinity for oxygen increases (left shift on @oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve@), and this results in oxygen uptake by hemoglobin; therefore, erythrocyte sickling will decrease.  Similarly, increased acidity or low pH is associated with sickling, so decreased acidity with elevated capillary pH values >7.4 would not promote sickling. $#(Choice B)#  The globin chains in the hemoglobin tetramer are folded compactly, with nonpolar hydrophobic residues in the interior and charged polar residues on the surface.  A valine for glutamic acid substitution does not result in a significant change in β globin folding.  It is the mature hemoglobin tetramer that undergoes polymerization, not individual globin chains during folding. $#(Choice D)#  HbS does not polymerize when fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is present, so patients with sickle cell anemia often do not have symptoms until the HbF fraction decreases a few months after delivery.  Some patients with HbS may have fewer clinical manifestations because they produce larger amounts of HbF as adults. $#Educational objective# Hemoglobin S (HbS) aggregates in the deoxygenated state.  HbS polymers form fibrous strands that reduce red blood cell membrane flexibility and promote sickling.  Sickling occurs under conditions associated with anoxia including low pH and high levels of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate.  These inflexible erythrocytes predispose to microvascular occlusion and microinfarcts.  ",

  "explanation_2": "$This patient most likely has #familial erythrocytosis# due to a β-globin mutation resulting in reduced binding of #2,3-bisphosphoglycerate# (2,3-BPG).  2,3-BPG is synthesized from glycolytic intermediates and binds strongly to deoxyhemoglobin in a pocket formed between the 2 beta chains.  This binding reduces the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin, allowing more oxygen to diffuse into the peripheral tissues.  The hemoglobin 2,3-BPG binding pocket contains positively charged amino acids (eg, histidine and lysine) that attract the negatively charged phosphate groups in 2,3-BPG.  Mutations that decrease the positive charge of the binding site decrease 2,3-BPG binding and #increase hemoglobin oxygen affinity#. $#Fetal hemoglobin# (hemoglobin F) is synthesized primarily during fetal development (~8 weeks until term) and consists of the usual 2 alpha chains with 2 gamma chains in place of beta chains.  The gamma chains do not bind effectively to 2,3-BPG due to replacement of a histidine residue with serine.  As a result, fetal hemoglobin has significantly higher oxygen affinity than adult hemoglobin A.  This allows fetal hemoglobin to extract more oxygen from the mother's adult hemoglobin in the placenta, providing the developing fetus with an adequate supply of oxygen. $#(Choice A)#  Hemoglobin A1c is formed by non-enzymatic glycosylation of hemoglobin A.  Glycosylation can interfere with the binding of 2,3-BPG to hemoglobin by altering the physical structure of the binding pocket, which is compensated for by increased red cell 2,3-BPG levels in patients with diabetes.  However, the reduced 2,3-BPG binding affinity of this patient’s mutated hemoglobin more closely resembles that of hemoglobin F. $#(Choice B)#  Hemoglobin C results from a mutation in the β-globin chain that causes glutamate to be replaced by lysine.  Hemoglobin C forms hexagonal crystals and promotes red cell dehydration, causing a mild chronic hemolytic anemia.  2,3-BPG binding and tissue oxygen delivery are not significantly altered. $#(Choice D)#  A defect in the synthesis of alpha chains results in varying degrees of alpha thalassemia, which is characterized by the formation of β-globin and γ-globin tetramers (hemoglobin H and Barts, respectively).  These abnormal tetramers have extremely high oxygen affinity (resembling myoglobin) and are ineffective at delivering oxygen to tissues. $#(Choice E)#  Hemoglobin S is the predominant form of hemoglobin in sickle cell disease and is caused by replacement of a glutamate by valine in the β-globin chain.  This results in formation of hemoglobin polymers with reduced oxygen affinity. $#Educational objective# 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) normally forms ionic bonds with the beta subunits of deoxygenated hemoglobin A, facilitating oxygen release in the peripheral tissues.  Mutations that result in loss of the 2,3-BPG binding pocket's positive charge cause hemoglobin A to resemble fetal hemoglobin, which binds oxygen with a higher affinity due to its inability to interact with 2,3-BPG.

Hemoglobin A (the major form of hemoglobin in adults) is a tetramer consisting of 2 alpha and 2 beta chains.

After binding to 1 oxygen molecule, the oxygen affinity of other heme molecules increases; this heme-heme interaction is responsible for the characteristic sigmoid shape of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve. $In contrast to hemoglobin, myoglobin is a monomeric protein and the primary oxygen-storing protein in skeletal and cardiac muscle tissue; it is only found in the bloodstream after muscle injury.  The partial pressure of oxygen at which 50% of myoglobin molecules are oxygen saturated (P50) is only 1 mm Hg, which is much lower than the P50 of hemoglobin (26 mm Hg).

His #hepatomegaly# is likely due to alcohol-associated hepatic steatosis.  The patient also has #macrocytic anemia# (low hemoglobin and elevated mean corpuscular volume [MCV] >100 µm3), which often develops in patients with chronic alcohol use due to folic acid deficiency (within months) or vitamin B12 deficiency (within years). $Both deficiencies lead to #megaloblastosis#, the underlying biochemical feature of which is a defect in DNA synthesis.  Folic acid is a single carbon donor required for synthesis of purine and pyrimidine (eg, thymidine) bases incorporated in DNA.  RNA and protein synthesis may continue relatively unaltered, leading to a state of unbalanced cytoplasmic growth with impaired cell division.  Pancreatic insufficiency is also associated with vitamin B12 deficiency as pancreatic enzymes normally cleave R factor from B12, allowing B12 to bind to intrinsic factor and be absorbed. $#(Choice B)#  The thalassemias are disorders presenting with reduced or absent globin chain production.  Almost all thalassemia cases result in hypochromia and microcytosis (low MCV). $#(Choice C)#  Oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate by pyruvate dehydrogenase requires thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), a derivative of thiamine (vitamin B1).  Patients with alcohol use disorder may be prone to thiamine deficiency and could therefore suffer from impaired pyruvate decarboxylation, but this does not cause macrocytic anemia. $#(Choice D)#  Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) catalyzes the transaminase reactions by acting as a carrier of the amino group.  B6 deficiency can cause an anemia that is hypochromic, microcytic (low MCV), and sideroblastic. $#(Choice E)#  Iron deficiency anemia is typically hypochromic and microcytic (low MCV <80 µm3). $#Educational objective# The underlying biochemical feature of megaloblastosis is a defect in DNA synthesis.  In patients with chronic alcohol use, megaloblastic macrocytic anemia can result from a nutritional deficiency of vitamin B12 or of folate, which impairs synthesis of purine and pyrimidine bases.

These drugs covalently attach an alkyl group to purine base pairs, which results in #cross-linking# within and between DNA strands.  Repair of DNA cross-links typically involves inducing double-stranded DNA breaks, therefore, proteins encoded by BRCA genes are also important for cross-link repair.  Tumor cells with BRCA mutations are more likely to accumulate excessive DNA cross-links and undergo apoptosis when exposed to platinum compounds, resulting in greater #tumor regression# compared to patients with intact BRCA genes. $In contrast, paclitaxel therapy targets the cytoskeletal protein tubulin, which contributes to mitotic spindle formation, chromosome segregation, and cell division.  Because BRCA mutations do not significantly impact the cytoskeleton, patients with and without BRCA mutations typically have a similar response to paclitaxel treatment. $#(Choice A)#  DNA methylation helps regulate gene transcription.  Many cancers increase methylation of the promoter region of tumor suppressor genes, which reduces their transcription.  Although some chemotherapy agents (eg, decitabine, 5-azacytidine) can alter DNA methylation, this is not the mechanism of carboplatin or paclitaxel. $#(Choice B)#  The constitutive activation of growth factor genes often contributes to the unchecked growth of cancer cells.  Therefore, growth factor inhibitors (eg, erlotinib, afatinib) are used to treat many cancer types (eg, lung, colon).  Carboplatin and paclitaxel do not work by this mechanism. $#(Choices D and E)#  Cancerous cells often develop mutations in genes that control the cell cycle (eg, CDKs, RB) or cell death (eg, BCL-2, p53).  Although medications (eg, venetoclax) have been developed to counter the products of these mutations, neither carboplatin nor paclitaxel focuses primarily on the cell cycle. $#Educational objective# Germline mutations in the BRCA gene dramatically increase the risk for breast and ovarian cancer due to an inability to repair double-stranded DNA breaks.  Cancers with BRCA gene mutations are often particularly susceptible to treatment with platinum compounds (eg, carboplatin), which cause DNA cross-linking requiring repair by BRCA-encoded machinery.
