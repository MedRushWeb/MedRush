  "explanation_2": "This patient with fever, cough, and radiologic evidence of consolidation in the right lower lung has #pneumonia#.  Her tachycardia, #hypotension#, and confusion (evidence of #end-organ hypoperfusion#) are most likely due to #septic shock#, which is characterized by increased permeability of the vascular endothelium with leakage of intravascular fluid into the extravascular space. $In the management of septic shock, rapid restoration of intravascular volume and adequate end-organ perfusion is critical.  This is best accomplished with the administration of boluses of #isotonic crystalloid# in the form of 0.9% (normal) saline or lactated Ringer solution through large-bore, peripheral intravenous catheters.  These solutions are ideal for volume resuscitation because they have osmolarity very close to the normal osmolarity of the blood (~285 mOsm/kg H2O), while the sodium and chloride ions help retain the fluid in the extracellular space. $Prompt initiation of appropriate empiric antibiotic therapy is also critical in the management of septic shock. $#(Choices A and C)#  0.45% (half-normal) saline is hypotonic; 5% dextrose in 0.45% saline is hypertonic initially but becomes hypotonic following infusion because the dextrose is rapidly metabolized.  These hypotonic solutions are often used at low infusion rates for patients with a deficiency of free water (ie, hypernatremia) or for maintenance hydration.  However, they are not effective for rapid volume resuscitation because the low osmolarity causes much of the fluid volume to shift into the intracellular space following infusion. $#(Choice B)#  Infusion of 3% (hypertonic) saline can lead to rapid fluid-shifting from the intracellular to the extracellular space with potentially devastating consequences (eg, osmotic demyelination syndrome); therefore, 3% saline is not appropriate for rapid volume resuscitation.  It is appropriate for careful use in patients with severe symptomatic hyponatremia. $#(Choice D)#  Albumin solution is an isotonic colloid solution that can be used for rapid volume resuscitation. However, it is less preferred due to high cost and limited availability compared to isotonic crystalloid. $#(Choice F)#  Sodium bicarbonate solutions can have variable tonicity and are typically used at low infusion rates for patients with severe metabolic acidosis.  These solutions are generally not used for rapid volume resuscitation. $#Educational objective# The initial management of septic shock requires rapid fluid resuscitation to replace intravascular volume and restore adequate end-organ perfusion.  This is best accomplished with intravenous boluses of isotonic crystalloid in the form of 0.9% (normal) saline or lactated Ringer solution because these solutions remain in the extracellular space.

OHS results from physical restriction of lung expansion by excessive thoracic tissue mass.  As such, the hypoventilation mostly results from #reduced tidal volume# and patients may have normal or increased respiratory rate.  Most patients with OHS also have concomitant obstructive sleep apnea (OSA); unlike isolated OSA that involves hypoventilation only with sleep, OHS involves hypoventilation throughout the waking hours. $In healthy individuals, a normal alveolar to arterial (A-a) gradient ranges from 4-15 mm Hg, with older individuals having a gradient towards the higher end of normal.  A #normal A-a gradient# indicates that the efficiency of gas exchange between the alveoli and the blood is intact; therefore, hypoxemia must result from low partial pressure of alveolar oxygen (PAO2).  Low PAO2 can occur due to #alveolar hypoventilation# (eg, OHS, neuromuscular disease, central depression of respiratory drive) or inspiration of low partial pressure of oxygen at high altitude. $#(Choices B and C)#  Destruction of lung parenchyma occurs with both emphysema and interstitial lung disease.  This leads to disruption of the alveolar-capillary membrane and impaired diffusion capacity with an increased A-a gradient.  In OHS, the lung parenchyma is undamaged and diffusion capacity is intact. $#(Choice D)#  Although the lung parenchyma is unaffected in OHS, restricted expansion of the chest wall secondarily restricts lung expansion, effectively decreasing lung compliance. $#(Choice E)#  Tissue oxygen consumption does increase with increased body mass, but it is a relatively minor factor and would not cause hypoxemia or hypercapnia in the absence of hypoventilation. $#(Choice F)#  Right-to-left shunting (eg, Eisenmenger syndrome) results in hypoxemia with an elevated A-a gradient because a large percentage of cardiac output bypasses the alveolar capillaries and does not undergo gas exchange. $#Educational objective# Obesity hypoventilation syndrome commonly presents with chronic fatigue, dyspnea, and difficulty concentrating.  Patients will have BMI >30 kg/m2 and arterial blood gas while awake showing evidence of hypoventilation, including hypercapnia (PaCO2 >45 mm Hg) and usually hypoxemia (PaO2 <75 mm Hg).

Patients age >35 experience steady decreases in chest wall compliance as a result of stiffening from rib calcification and from increased thoracic curvature due to osteoporosis and osteoarthritis.  In contrast, lung compliance increases with age due to a loss of elastic recoil, particularly in the alveolar ducts.  The dilation of alveolar ducts is homogenous, as opposed to the emphysema associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and is not associated with destruction of the alveolar walls. $Diminished elastic recoil and the collapse of supporting tissues around the airways cause a significant #increase# in #residual volume# (RV).  However, #total lung capacity# (TLC) remains #unchanged# because the decreased chest wall compliance counterbalances increases in lung compliance #(choices A, D, and E)#.

  "explanation_2": "$Under normal conditions, the PO2 of @inspired ambient air@ is approximately 160 mm Hg.  This value decreases to approximately 150 mm Hg in the trachea due to the partial pressure of water vapor.  @Normal@ #alveolar PO2 is 104 mm Hg#, which lies between the tracheal (150 mm Hg) and systemic venous blood (40 mm Hg) PO2 concentrations.  Likewise, normal #alveolar PCO2 is 40 mm Hg#, also between its respective tracheal (0 mm Hg) and systemic venous blood concentrations (45 mm Hg). $Transfer of O2 and CO2 between the blood and the alveoli depends on both perfusion and diffusion.  Under normal resting conditions, diffusion of O2 and CO2 is a quick process, with blood needing to traverse only one-third of the total pulmonary capillary length to completely equilibrate.  In this setting, gas exchange is perfusion-limited (ie, diffusion is fast enough that the total gas exchange depends only on the amount of blood supplied to the alveoli). $#Diffusion-limited gas exchange# takes place when diffusion across the alveolar membrane is relatively slow enough to become the major limitation to gas exchange.  This can occur with exercise (due to extremely high perfusion volumes that the diffusion rate cannot keep up with) or with pathologic conditions that disrupt the alveolar membrane (eg, pulmonary fibrosis, emphysema) and slow diffusion.  #CO2 diffuses 20 times faster than O2#, even when the alveolar membrane is somewhat disrupted; therefore, alveolar and capillary CO2 concentrations typically fully equilibrate while alveolar and capillary O2 concentrations do not. $In this experiment, there is a #large PO2 gradient# between the alveoli (104 mm Hg) and the pulmonary venous blood (70 mm Hg) but pulmonary venous #PCO2 is normal# (40 mm Hg), indicating incomplete gas exchange most likely due to diffusion impairment. $#(Choice A)#  @Bronchopulmonary shunting@ describes the normal small drop in PO2 and small increase in PCO2 that occurs due to the pulmonary veins receiving deoxygenated blood from the bronchial circulation.  However, this normally only results in about a 4 mm Hg drop in PO2 within the pulmonary veins. $#(Choice C)#  In normal alveolar ventilation and perfusion, the alveolar and pulmonary capillary PO2 rapidly reach equilibrium at 104 mm Hg. $#(Choice D)#  @Intrapulmonary shunting@ can occur when the alveoli fill with fluid (eg, pneumonia, pulmonary edema) or collapse (eg, atelectasis) and alveolar ventilation is essentially zero.  This patient's alveolar PO2 of 104 mm Hg is not consistent with shunting (alveolar PO2 equilibrates with venous blood at 40 mm Hg when ventilation is zero). $#(Choice E)#  @Poor alveolar ventilation@ (ie, hypoventilation) does not affect gas exchange between the alveoli and the blood; therefore, no O2 gradient is created. $#Educational objective# Gas exchange between the alveoli and pulmonary capillary blood depends on both perfusion and diffusion.  The exchange of O2 and CO2 in a normal individual at rest is perfusion-limited, so alveolar and capillary partial pressures are equal.  Situations in which O2 exchange becomes diffusion-limited (eg, emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis) cause a large gradient between alveolar and capillary PO2; PCO2 is less affected due to the greater diffusing capacity of CO2.

Such an environment stimulates an array of #physiologic responses# aimed at maintaining adequate O2 delivery to the tissues.  The initial responses to high altitude include: $• Peripheral chemoreceptors in the aorta and carotid body stimulate #hyperventilation# in an effort to increase arterial oxygenation (PaO2).  The hyperventilation also increases CO2 removal to decrease PaCO2 and cause respiratory alkalosis.  The alkalosis initially shifts the @hemoglobin dissociation curve@ to the left to increase O2 uptake in the lungs. $• Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction occurs to minimize ventilation-perfusion mismatching and optimize pulmonary O2 uptake.  This leads to #increased pulmonary vascular resistance#, which increases pulmonary arterial pressure. $• Sympathetic activity is increased, leading to #increased heart rate and cardiac output#. $• Despite the drop in PaCO2 (which encourages cerebral vasoconstriction), reduced PaO2 and marked tissue hypoxia lead to overall cerebral vasodilation to increase cerebral blood flow. $Additional responses occur over the next 24-48 hours: $• The kidneys increase HCO3− excretion (compensatory metabolic acidosis), which decreases blood pH.  Because central chemoreceptors inhibit ventilation when pH gets too high, the HCO3− excretion allows for additional hyperventilation. $• Hypoxemia suppresses aldosterone activity, which together with increased HCO3− excretion results in diuresis and total body volume loss.  The #reduced plasma volume# increases hematocrit and also reduces cardiac preload to decrease myocardial O2 demand.

In addition, the kidneys increase secretion of erythropoietin.  There is also upregulation of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) in cells throughout the body.  HIF stimulates erythropoiesis as well as increased angiogenesis in skeletal muscle and other tissues to improve O2 delivery. $Individuals who remain at high altitude for an extended period will experience the full benefit of increased erythropoietin secretion and upregulation of HIF, as secondary polycythemia (increased O2 carrying capacity) and angiogenesis are maximized after several weeks. $#Educational objective# An array of physiologic responses takes place to maintain adequate O2 delivery to the tissues in the hypoxic environment at high altitude.

The #lungs #have a #tendency to collapse# at all lung volumes; therefore, the entire lung curve is located in the positive region.  In contrast, the resting #chest wall# has a #tendency to expand# at all but very high lung volumes; therefore, most of the chest wall curve is located in the negative region.  The point where the collapsing force of the lungs is equivalent to the expanding force of the chest wall is the #resting equilibrium# of the respiratory system (ie, @end-tidal expiration@), represented by the black dot); the alveolar pressure at this point is equivalent to atmospheric pressure (ie, 0 cm H2O) and the lung volume is the #functional residual capacity# (FRC). $Compliance is defined as change in volume per change in pressure and is represented by the slope of the pressure-volume curve.  A highly compliant container is able to stretch to accommodate large increases in volume with little change in pressure, demonstrating a steep compliance curve.  Generally, lung compliance is greatest around the FRC and decreases at very high and very low lung volumes (note that surface tension causes compliance to @differ@ during inspiration and expiration).  The chest wall has low compliance at low lung volumes and becomes more compliant as lung volume increases with inspiration.  The compliance of the respiratory system as a whole is the combined compliance of the lungs and chest wall (represented by the blue curve). $#Intrapleural pressures# are not represented on the lung pressure-volume curve.  The expanding force of the chest wall working in opposition to the collapsing force of the lungs creates #negative intrapleural pressure# throughout the @respiratory cycle@.  Inspiration is driven by active expansion of the chest wall, which generates even greater intrapleural negative pressure and pulls the lungs outward.  Intrapleural negative pressure peaks at maximal inspiration at a value of approximately -8 cm H2O.  During passive expiration the chest wall relaxes and the respiratory system returns to its equilibrium position, in which intrapleural pressure is approximately #-5 cm H2O#. $#Educational objective# The lungs generate a collapsing force and the chest wall generates an expanding force; the point at which these opposing forces are equivalent is the resting equilibrium of the respiratory system, where alveolar pressure is equal to atmospheric pressure (ie, 0 cm H2O) and lung volume is the functional residual capacity.

Oxygen has a minimal effect on respiratory drive unless the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) drops below 60-70 mm Hg; therefore, the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) is the major stimulator of respiration in healthy individuals.  However, patients with long-standing COPD have decreased sensitivity to PaCO2 (due to chronic CO2 retention) and may also have profound hypoxemia (PaO2 <60 mm Hg); therefore, PaO2 levels can become a significant contributor to respiratory drive. $The depth and rate of respirations are controlled by the medullary respiratory center based on input from central and peripheral chemoreceptors and airway mechanoreceptors.  Peripheral chemoreceptors found in the #carotid and aortic bodies# are the primary sites for sensing PaO2 and are stimulated by hypoxemia.  When #supplemental oxygen# is administered, the rapid increase in PaO2 can #reduce peripheral chemoreceptor stimulation# and decrease the respiratory rate. $Reduced respiratory rate is a minor contributor to the @oxygen-induced hypercapnia@ that can occur in patients with COPD; increased ventilation-perfusion mismatch triggered by alleviation of pulmonary vasoconstriction in poorly ventilated areas is the major mechanism. $#(Choice B)#  Central chemoreceptors, located in the medulla, are more involved in the respiratory response to hypercapnia than to hypoxemia.  CO2 readily diffuses through the blood-brain barrier and forms hydrogen ions in the cerebrospinal fluid; the resulting decrease in pH is detected by medullary neurons, triggering an increase in respiration.  Because the blood-brain barrier is relatively impermeable to hydrogen ions, blood pH itself has little effect on central chemoreceptors. $#(Choice C)#  The juxtaglomerular apparatus is located in the kidneys and consists of juxtaglomerular cells and the macula densa.  It helps regulate renal blood flow and the glomerular filtration rate via renin secretion. $#(Choices D and E)#  Pulmonary stretch receptors include myelinated and unmyelinated C fibers in the lungs and airways.  These receptors regulate the duration of inspiration depending on the degree of lung distension (Hering-Breuer reflex). $#Educational objective# Arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) is the major stimulator of respiration in healthy individuals; even a slight increase in PaCO2 stimulates central chemoreceptors and triggers increased ventilation.  In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the response to PaCO2 is blunted and hypoxemia can contribute to respiratory drive.  Peripheral chemoreceptors are primarily responsible for sensing arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) and can be suppressed with oxygen administration.  ",

The channel pore #opens# after binding of #2 ATP molecules#, allowing transport of chloride ions down the electrochemical gradient.  The movement of chloride establishes a membrane potential that draws sodium and water across the membrane as well.  By encouraging sodium chloride and water transport across epithelial membranes, the CFTR #hydrates mucosal surfaces# in the airways and bowel.  Mutations in the CFTR gene lead to intracellular protein degradation and decreased activity of the proteins that do reach the membrane.  This leads to #thick mucus# on the lining of epithelial cells, which results in clinical manifestations of chronic cough, recurrent pneumonias, and pancreatic damage. $The normal CFTR protein also plays a role in the production of hypotonic sweat.  In the eccrine gland, sweat is initially isotonic with the plasma, and normally sodium chloride is removed from the ductal lumen by CFTR.  In the absence of functional CFTR, patients with CF cannot remove salt from their sweat and therefore have #elevated sweat chloride# and sodium levels.  As early as the 17th century, increased mortality was recognized for children whose foreheads tasted salty.  Today, the sweat chloride test is frequently used to screen for CF. $#(Choice B)#  Cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels are important for photoreceptor and olfactory receptor neurons.

Increases in physiologic dead space occur in many lung diseases, including pulmonary embolism, emphysema, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. $Dead space volume remains relatively constant on a minute-by-minute basis.  However, #lower tidal volumes #increase the proportion of each breath composed of dead space.  If #minute ventilation# (tidal volume x respiratory rate) is #unchanged#, the consequence of the low-tidal-volumes is an #increase in dead space ventilation# (inefficient breathing). $Patients undergoing #mechanical ventilation weaning# typically have weakened respiratory muscles and therefore tend to breathe at low tidal volumes to minimize the work of breathing.  This hypoventilation triggers an increase in respiratory drive that #increases respiratory rate# to maintain minute ventilation.  When patients are being weaned off the ventilator, the ratio of their respiratory rate/tidal volume, known as the rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI), is measured; a low RSBI indicates relatively high tidal volumes, relatively efficient breathing, and a lower likelihood of recurrent respiratory failure once ventilatory support is discontinued. $#(Choice A)#  Increases in both respiratory rate and tidal volume result in increased minute ventilation.  However, the graph shows that minute ventilation remains the same after ventilator adjustment. $#(Choice C)#  A decrease in respiratory rate and an increase in tidal volume would keep minute ventilation constant; however, the total volume of dead-space air breathed each minute would decrease rather than increase. $#(Choice D)#  Decreases in both respiratory rate and tidal volume would result in decreased, rather than constant, minute ventilation. $#Educational objective# Patients being weaned from mechanical ventilation typically breathe at low tidal volumes, with a compensatory increase in respiratory rate to maintain minute ventilation.  Because at low tidal volumes a higher proportion of each breath is composed of dead space, this type of breathing leads to an increase in wasted ventilation (inefficient breathing).  "

  "explanation_2": "$The human respiratory system undergoes significant changes during #normal aging#.  Pulmonary gas exchange becomes subtly impaired due to a sequence of gradual changes: $• Lung elastin degrades over time, leading to #alveolar simplification# (loss of surface area due to airspace enlargement).  Loss of elastic fiber support causes dynamic airflow obstruction resembling emphysema, leading to hyperinflation.  Therefore, inspired tidal volume has less opportunity to participate in gas exchange.  In other words, physiologic @dead space@ is #increased#. $• The muscles of respiration (chiefly the diaphragm) undergo remodeling over time, with atrophy of fast-twitch muscle fibers.  This leads to #lower peak force production# for maneuvers such as deep inspiration or coughing.  In combination with chest wall stiffening, this allows a small degree of #microatelectasis# to develop at the lung bases.  This results in #intrapulmonary shunting# (perfusion of blood through atelectatic [nonventilated] alveoli). $• This combination of increased dead space and increased shunt effect leads to greater #ventilation-perfusion mismatch#.  This ultimately causes the alveolar-arterial (A-a) oxygen gradient to progressively widen over decades.  When evaluating an #elevated A-a gradient#, patient age must be accounted for to determine whether it is within the expected limits of normal aging (expected A-a gradient = age/3 mm Hg). $• Because of the higher A-a gradient, arterial partial pressure of oxygen (#PaO2#) #falls# during aging (from 90 to 70 mm Hg by age 80).  Since PaO2 still remains on the plateau portion of the @oxyhemoglobin desaturation curve@, no change in SaO2 would be detected by simple pulse oximetry. $In contrast to decreased PaO2, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood (#PaCO2#) (reflecting total alveolar ventilation) is #not significantly changed#.  Although dead space increases and peak diaphragm strength is reduced, these changes are not enough to cause alveolar hypoventilation by themselves; resting hypoventilation (elevated PaCO2) at any age is always pathologic.  Instead, elderly persons are less able to compensate for high minute ventilation loads (eg, sepsis, thyrotoxicosis), making them prone to hypercapnia when acutely ill. $#Educational objective# Normal aging is characterized by a gradual increase in ventilation-perfusion mismatch (due to basilar microatelectasis causing shunt effect) and increased dead space (loss of alveolar surface area).

The physiologic changes that occur are most pronounced in highly trained athletes: $• #Increased minute ventilation# occurs via an increase in respiratory rate and tidal volume and facilitates an increased rate of #oxygen uptake# and #carbon dioxide removal#.  The increase in tidal volume can reach up to 50% of resting @vital capacity@. $• The increased minute ventilation #increases alveolar ventilation# throughout the lungs up to 20 times resting levels.  Pulmonary vascular resistance is reduced and cardiac output is increased, which allows for more evenly distributed blood flow throughout the lungs and #reduced physiologic dead space# (ie, reduction in the proportion of air in the respiratory tract that does not participate in gas exchange).  Although blood flow through the lungs is increased (the increase in cardiac output maxes out at approximately 8 times resting levels), alveolar ventilation is more increased (ie, ventilatory capacity exceeds cardiac output capacity), resulting in an #increased ventilation-perfusion ratio#. $In addition, an accumulation of lactic acid decreases blood pH and stimulates a #rightward shift# in the @hemoglobin dissociation curve@, facilitating #increased unloading of oxygen# in skeletal muscle.  Although increased cardiac output increases the rate of blood flow through the skeletal muscle capillaries and reduces the time allowed for oxygen unloading, the rate of arterial oxygen extraction by skeletal muscle markedly increases during exercise, outpacing cardiac output.  This results in increased fractional extraction of arterial oxygen and #decreased mixed venous oxygen content#. $It follows that cardiac output, and not alveolar ventilation or the rate of oxygen uptake by skeletal muscle, is the primary limitation to aerobic exercise. $#Educational objective# Physiologic changes in the respiratory system that occur with exercise include increased minute ventilation (via both an increase in respiratory rate and tidal volume), reduced physiologic dead space, increased ventilation-perfusion ratio, and increased extraction of oxygen by skeletal muscle (resulting in decreased mixed venous oxygen content).

Panic attacks are typically accompanied by #hyperventilation# with a resulting #decrease in arterial partial pressure of CO2# (PaCO2).  This hypocapnia can cause #decreased cerebral perfusion# with consequent neurologic sequelae, including generalized weakness, blurred vision, presyncope (ie, dizziness, lightheadedness), and syncope. $#Cerebral blood flow# (CBF) remains relatively constant over a wide range of perfusion pressures (cerebrovascular autoregulation) and is mainly influenced by arterial blood gas levels, particularly changes in PaCO2.  Hypercapnia triggers an increase in CBF (to aid in removal of toxins), and hypocapnia triggers a decrease in CBF.  In fact, because hypocapnia decreases CBF, mechanically ventilated patients with cerebral edema are often hyperventilated to decrease intracranial pressure and help prevent brain herniation. $CBF is less sensitive to the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2).  PaO2 has little influence on CBF until the level drops below 50 mm Hg, at which point a rapid increase in CBF is triggered. $#(Choices B and D)#  The total blood O2 content is predominantly made up of hemoglobin-bound O2 (determined by the blood hemoglobin level and PaO2) plus a small contribution of dissolved O2.  Hyperventilation increases the alveolar partial pressure of O2 and should somewhat increase (rather than decrease) both PaO2 and total blood O2 content. $#(Choice C)#  Hyperventilation produces respiratory alkalosis, marked by an increase in arterial pH. $#(Choice E)#  Disturbances that increase the alveolar-arterial O2 gradient include V/Q mismatch (eg, pulmonary embolism), diffusion limitation, and right-to-left shunting (eg, Eisenmenger syndrome).  Changes in ventilation rate (ie, hypo- or hyperventilation) have no effect on the alveolar-arterial O2 gradient. $#(Choice F)#  Increased arterial lactic acid content is a sign of tissue hypoxia (eg, due to sepsis or ischemia), which is unlikely in the setting of hyperventilation from a panic attack. $#Educational objective# Panic attacks are typically accompanied by hyperventilation, leading to hypocapnia.  Cerebral blood flow is directly related to the arterial partial pressure of CO2; therefore, hypocapnia can lead to reduced cerebral blood flow and symptoms of cerebral hypoperfusion (eg, blurred vision, dizziness, lightheadedness).

  "explanation_2": "$The graph illustrates the pO2 of blood as it moves through the lungs and into the systemic circulation.  Blood in the pulmonary arteries comes from the systemic venous system and is normally deoxygenated.  As blood moves through the pulmonary capillaries, it becomes progressively more oxygenated until it equilibrates with the alveolar pO2 (~104 mm Hg when breathing room air).  This is represented by the curve's first upward deflection and subsequent plateau.  However, blood in the left atrium and ventricle has a slightly lower pO2 (~100 mm Hg) than blood in the pulmonary capillaries.  This is due to the #mixing of deoxygenated blood# with oxygenated blood from the pulmonary veins and is represented by the downward deflection identified by the arrow.  This deoxygenated blood comes from the following sources:  $1. The #bronchial arteries# carry blood to the bronchi and bronchioles and, together with the pulmonary artery, form the dual blood supply to the lungs.  The #bronchial veins# return only a portion of this blood to the right heart via the azygos and hemi-azygos veins; most of the blood supplied by the bronchial arteries returns to the left heart via the #pulmonary veins#.  $2. Small cardiac (#thebesian#) veins that drain into the left atrium and ventricle also contribute to normal anatomic shunting. $#(Choice A)#  Hypoxia due to a diffusion limitation frequently results from pulmonary fibrosis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, emphysema, or hyaline membrane disease of the infant.  In diffusion-limited gas exchange, the blood pO2 does not equilibrate with the alveolar pO2 by the end of its traversal through the alveolar capillaries. $#(Choice B)#  Dead space ventilation (wasted ventilation) refers to the volume of inspired air that does not participate in gas exchange.  Anatomic dead space refers to the volume of air that remains in the conducting parts of the airways, such as the bronchi and bronchioles.  Alveolar dead space refers to the volume of air in the alveoli that cannot participate in gas exchange due to poor perfusion. $#(Choice D)#  Perfusion-limited gas exchange occurs in the normal physiologic resting state, as equilibration of the blood with the alveolar gas is complete by the time the blood traverses one-third of the total pulmonary capillary length. $#(Choice E)#  The @hemoglobin dissociation curve@ shifts to the right in the systemic capillaries to increase oxygen delivery to the body tissues.  Increases in pCO2, temperature, and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate concentration cause right-shifting of the curve; the opposite conditions cause a left shift and favor oxygen loading in the lungs. $#Educational objective# The pO2 in the left atrium and ventricle is lower than that in the pulmonary capillaries due to mixing of oxygenated blood from the pulmonary veins with deoxygenated blood from the bronchial circulation and thebesian veins.

The #total O2# #content# of the blood (CaO2) is determined primarily by the #amount of hemoglobin# in the blood and its #percentage of O2# #saturation# (SaO2), which is directly influenced by changes in arterial O2 tension (PaO2) of the dissolved O2 according to the oxygen-hemoglobin @dissociation curve@.  Freely dissolved O2 normally accounts for only a very small proportion of the total O2 content of blood due to its low solubility in plasma. $This patient's #low CaO2# in the arterial blood but #normal PaO2# #and SaO2# are suggestive of #low hemoglobin# (ie, anemia), which reduces the total O2 content in the blood despite a normal partial pressure and percentage of O2 saturation.  A common cause of anemia in this patient's age group includes #chronic blood loss# (eg, heavy menses). $#(Choice B)#  Cyanide inhibits oxidative phosphorylation by inhibiting ferric iron (Fe3+) in cytochrome c oxidase, lowering O2 consumption in peripheral tissue.  Arterial PaO2, SaO2, and CaO2 remain unchanged, but venous O2 content rises and the arterial-venous O2 gradient falls.  Cyanide may also bind to the ferrous (Fe2+) iron of hemoglobin to form cyanhemoglobin but typically only in small amounts that do not appreciably change arterial O2 content. $#(Choice C)#  Primary polycythemia (polycythemia vera) is due to a genetic mutation causing increased red blood cell (RBC) production.  The hemoglobin within RBCs functions normally (normal SaO2), but there is a greater total amount of hemoglobin (increased CaO2).  There are no effects on dissolved oxygen (normal PaO2). $#(Choice D)#  The O2 tension in high-altitude settings is relatively low compared to that at sea level.  Recent exposure to a high-altitude environment would result in reduced alveolar O2 tension, leading to reduced PaO2 and SaO2, with a corresponding decrease in CaO2. $#(Choice E)#  Right to left intrapulmonary shunting occurs when venous blood flows through inadequately ventilated alveoli (eg, pulmonary edema).  This blood remains deoxygenated as it reenters the systemic circulation.  It has a low PaO2 and SaO2, with a corresponding decrease in CaO2. $#Educational objective# The total oxygen content of blood (CaO2) is affected primarily by 2 variables:  hemoglobin concentration and its percentage of oxygen saturation (SaO2), which is directly affected by the arterial oxygen tension (PaO2).

The respiratory compensation involves hypoventilation to retain CO2 and decrease pH. $#(Choice C)#  This patient's low pH and high PaCO2 are consistent with respiratory acidosis, but the normal HCO3− indicates that renal compensation has not yet occurred. $#(Choice D)#  Respiratory alkalosis is indicated by high pH and low PaCO2.

  "explanation_2": "$The partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli (PAO2) is normally 104 mm Hg, and due to the high rate of O2 diffusion across the alveolar-capillary membrane, the O2 level in the alveolar capillary blood rapidly equilibrates with the PAO2.  However, the blood O2 level then drops slightly due to the addition of deoxygenated blood from the @bronchial circulation@; therefore, the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2) is normally around 100 mm Hg.  This discrepancy between alveolar and arterial O2 concentration is termed the alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradient.  In healthy individuals, a #normal A-a gradient# is typically between #4 and 15 mm Hg#, with older individuals having higher normal values due to an age-related decline in O2-diffusing capacity. $This patient has low PaO2 and PAO2 with a normal A-a gradient (68 − 60 = 8), indicating that his low PaO2 is directly due to low PAO2.  Possible causes of hypoxemia in the setting of a @normal A-a gradient@ include #alveolar hypoventilation# and low partial pressure of inspired oxygen (PiO2) (ie, high altitude).  Common causes of alveolar hypoventilation include suppressed central respiratory drive (eg, sedative overdose) and diseases that decrease inspiratory capacity (eg, myasthenia gravis, obesity). $#(Choices B and D)#  @Dead space ventilation@ is one extreme of ventilation-perfusion mismatch that occurs when the alveoli are adequately ventilated, but there is no alveolar perfusion (eg, pulmonary embolism).  An @intrapulmonary shunt@ is the other extreme of ventilation-perfusion mismatch that occurs when blood perfuses alveoli that are not ventilated (eg, pneumonia, pulmonary edema).  The A-a gradient is elevated in ventilation-perfusion mismatch. $#(Choice C)#  Gas diffusion is impaired in diseases that disrupt the alveolar-capillary membrane, such as alveolar hyaline membrane disease (acutely) or emphysema (chronically).  @Diffusion impairment@ causes an elevated A-a gradient because O2 cannot be effectively transported into the blood. $#(Choice E)#  A left-to-right shunt occurs when oxygenated blood from the left side of the heart is shunted into the right side of the heart (eg, atrial or ventricular septal defect).  Left-to-right shunts do not cause hypoxemia; however, if left untreated, they may progress into a right-to-left shunt (ie, Eisenmenger syndrome) with hypoxemia, cyanosis, and an elevated A-a gradient. $#Educational objective# There are 5 major causes of hypoxemia (low arterial partial pressure of oxygen [PaO2]): alveolar hypoventilation, low partial pressure of inspired oxygen, ventilation-perfusion mismatch, diffusion impairment, and right-to-left shunting.  The A-a gradient is normal with alveolar hypoventilation and low partial pressure of inspired oxygen, which helps distinguish these causes from other causes of hypoxemia.  ",

The vasodilation is predominant, resulting in overall #decreased systemic vascular resistance#.  There is also an increase in heart rate and stroke volume that markedly #increases cardiac output# and O2 delivery to the tissues.

Although venous pH may decrease significantly during moderate exercise, there is typically little change in arterial pH due to respiratory compensation. $#(Choice E)#  Physiologic dead space (ie, the air in the respiratory system that does not participate in gas exchange) is decreased during exercise due to a decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance that allows perfusion of additional pulmonary capillary beds. $#(Choice G)#  The mean O2 content of venous blood remains the same or decreases with exercise because the rate of O2 extraction by the tissues outpaces the rate of oxygen delivery (cardiac output).  In most healthy individuals, cardiac output is the major limiting factor to O2 consumption during exercise. $#Educational objective# During physical exercise, there is increased skeletal muscle CO2 production that increases the CO2 content of venous blood.  Arterial O2 and CO2 content remains constant via increases in alveolar ventilation and gas exchange efficiency.  Venous O2 content remains constant or is decreased due to increased O2 extraction by the tissues that matches or exceeds the rate of oxygen delivery (ie, O2 consumption during exercise is limited by cardiac output).

Because of its extensive metabolic activity, brown adipose tissue also has a higher oxygen requirement and contains more capillaries than white adipose tissue. $In most human cells, mitochondria are the major site of ATP production.

The most common finding is #goiter# due to overstimulation of the thyroid gland by TSH.  #Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder# (ADHD) and #tachycardia #are also common due to the preponderance of alpha thyroid hormone receptors (with normal sensitivity) in the CNS and heart. $#(Choice A)#  Chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto) thyroiditis leads to autoantibody-mediated thyroid gland destruction characterized by goiter and symptoms of hypothyroidism (eg, fatigue, constipation, dry skin).

  "explanation_2": "$Thyroid follicular cells take up iodide (I−), which is then transported into the thyroid follicular lumen, where it is oxidized to iodine (I2).  Following oxidation, in a process referred to as organification, iodine reacts with tyrosine residues in thyroglobulin to form monoiodotyrosine (MIT) and diiodotyrosine (DIT) (iodination).  While still attached to thyroglobulin, DIT and MIT participate in 2 coupling reactions:  The coupling of 2 DITs results in formation of #thyroxine# (T4); the combination of 1 DIT and 1 MIT leads to the formation of #triiodothyronine# (T3).  Subsequently, thyroglobulin, which is now attached to multiple iodinated tyrosine compounds (ie, MIT, DIT, T3, T4), is engulfed by the thyroid follicular cells and digested within lysosomes, releasing T3 and T4 into the circulation.  Free DIT and MIT are also produced, but only small amounts are secreted because iodotyrosine deiodinase removes the iodine groups from MIT and DIT for recycling #(choice B).# $#Thyroid peroxidase# (TPO) is a multifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of iodide, the iodination of thyroglobulin, and the coupling reaction between 2 iodized tyrosine residues.  Antibodies against TPO can be seen in a variety of autoimmune thyroid disorders, most commonly chronic lymphocytic (Hashimoto) thyroiditis (90% of patients).  Hashimoto thyroiditis is a common cause of diffuse goiter, as in this patient.  Although most patients develop residual hypothyroidism (low T4, elevated TSH), early in the disease they may be euthyroid (normal T4, normal TSH) or briefly hyperthyroid (elevated T4, suppressed TSH). $#(Choice A)#  Uptake of iodide from the blood against its concentration gradient is an energy-dependent process carried out by the sodium-iodide symporter and stimulated by TSH.  TPO is not involved in iodide uptake. $#(Choice D)#  Thyroglobulin is a high-molecular-weight, glycosylated protein that is the major component of colloid in the thyroid follicle.  TPO is involved in iodination, but not synthesis of thyroglobulin. $#(Choice E)#  As noted above, the thyroid produces both T3 and T4, although most is in the form of T4.  T3, the more active form of thyroid hormone, is produced primarily in peripheral tissues by deiodination of T4.  This reaction is catalyzed by iodothyronine deiodinase, not by TPO. $#Educational objective# Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) catalyzes the oxidation of iodide to iodine, the iodination of thyroglobulin tyrosine residues, and the iodotyrosine coupling reaction that forms T3 and T4.

TPO activity is increased by TSH and suppressed by thioamides (eg, methimazole, propylthiouracil).  Although TSH (and therefore iodination of thyroglobulin) falls in later ESS, this patient's TSH is normal, and his normal T4 level suggests adequate iodination. $#(Choice C)#  Although a small amount of T3 is produced in the thyroid (from T4 via 5'-deiodinase type II), most is produced in peripheral tissues.  The fall in circulating T3 levels in ESS is primarily due to suppression of peripheral conversion. $#(Choice D)#  Iodine deficiency is rare in developed countries.  When it occurs, it presents chronically with goiter and primary hypothyroidism (ie, elevated TSH, low T4).  This patient has a normal TSH level, making iodine deficiency unlikely. $#(Choice E)#  Proinflammatory cytokines decrease TSH levels by reducing secretion of TRH in the hypothalamus.

It is characterized by decreased conversion of T4 to T3 in peripheral tissues.  Initial findings include a low T3 level, but later, T4 and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels may also decrease.

Activating antibodies can be confirmed with a functional bioassay (thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin) that measures cyclic AMP production by a TSH-receptor–expressing cell line in response to patient serum. $#(Choice A)#  Antibodies to thyroglobulin are thought to reflect disruption of thyroid follicles, which exposes thyroglobulin to the bloodstream.  They are present in a number of autoimmune thyroid disorders but are most common in autoimmune hypothyroidism and are present in only a minority of patients with Graves disease. $#(Choice B)#  Thyroid peroxidase antibodies are most closely associated with Hashimoto thyroiditis and related disorders (eg, silent thyroiditis, postpartum thyroiditis).  Hyperthyroidism with exophthalmos is most consistent with Graves disease. $#(Choices D and E)#  Antibodies to thyroxine and triiodothyronine (ie, anti-T4 and anti-T3 immunoglobulins, respectively) can be detected by adding radiolabeled thyroid hormone to the patient's serum followed by precipitation of the antigen-antibody complexes with polyethylene glycol.  These antibodies can be seen in a variety of autoimmune thyroid disorders, but are rare. $#Educational objective# Graves disease is an autoimmune disorder triggered by thyrotropin receptor antibodies (TRAb) that bind and activate the TSH receptor.  Serum TRAb immunoassays have a high sensitivity and specificity for Graves disease.  ",

  "explanation_2": "This infant has #primary hypothyroidism#, a congenital disorder that is most commonly caused by abnormal thyroid gland development (ie, agenesis, hypoplasia) or location (ectopy).  During normal embryogenesis, the @thyroid descends@ from the developing pharynx to its normal location anterior to the trachea.  Abnormal migration results in an #ectopic thyroid# (eg, lingual, mediastinal), as seen in this patient. $Most patients with thyroid dysgenesis have hypothyroidism, with routine newborn screening findings of increased TSH and decreased thyroxine (T4) levels.  However, #newborns# are typically #asymptomatic# for the first weeks due to the presence of #maternal T4#, which #crosses the placenta in small amounts# during gestation.  The amount of neonatal #T4 is still low# compared to that in unaffected patients but is sufficient to initially prevent clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism. $As maternally derived neonatal T4 begins to wane in the first few weeks to months of life, classic symptoms of untreated hypothyroidism develop.  Presenting signs include lethargy, hypotonia, constipation, and poor feeding.  A hoarse cry, macroglossia, facial edema, and prolonged jaundice are also common. $#(Choice A)#  Ectopic thyroid tissue typically produces decreased, not increased, T4. $#(Choice B)#  Physiologically increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels in pregnancy result in increased total maternal T4 and triiodothyronine (T3) to maintain a euthyroid state.  Because maternal levels of free T4 and T3 remain normal, the increase in maternal TBG does not affect the fetus. $#(Choice C)#  Transplacental transfer of thyroid-stimulating antibodies in mothers with Graves disease results in transient neonatal hyperthyroidism (neonatal Graves disease).  Laboratory findings would show increased T4 and decreased TSH. $#(Choice E)#  TSH is a polypeptide hormone that does not cross the placenta. $#Educational objective# Congenital hypothyroidism, most commonly caused by abnormal thyroid gland development or location (ie, ectopy), is identified by elevated TSH and decreased thyroxine (T4) levels.

Her low thyroxine (T4), elevated TSH, and antithyroid peroxidase antibodies are further indicative of #primary hypothyroidism# from chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto) thyroiditis.  In patients with primary hypothyroidism, there is a compensatory increase in hypothalamic thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) production as thyroid hormone levels fall, stimulating increased secretion of TSH by the pituitary. $Prolactin is regulated primarily by the inhibitory effects of dopaminergic neurons from the hypothalamus.  However, lactotroph cells express TRH receptors, and TRH stimulates synthesis and release of prolactin.

As blood glucose levels fall, counterregulatory factors (eg, glucagon, epinephrine) are activated, leading to his symptoms (eg, palpitations, sweating), which are then relieved by the intake of sugar.  #Exercise-induced hypoglycemia# is common in patients with diabetes mellitus due to the lack of physiologic insulin regulation along with insufficient carbohydrate supplementation. $#(Choice A)#  As blood glucose levels fall during fasting or exercise, glucagon and epinephrine stimulate hepatic @glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis@, leading to increased (not decreased) glucose production. $#(Choice B)#  Glucokinase phosphorylates glucose to glucose-6-phosphate, primarily for glycogen synthesis.  It is expressed mainly in the liver and is stimulated by rising, not falling, glucose levels. $#(Choice C)#  Glucose-6-phosphatase catalyzes the hydrolysis of glucose-6-phosphate to glucose during gluconeogenesis, thereby helping to maintain glucose levels in the fasting state; increased activity would improve hypoglycemic symptoms by increasing circulating glucose levels. $#(Choice D)#  GLUT2 is found primarily in the liver and pancreatic beta cells, where it facilitates insulin-independent glucose uptake.  It is not expressed significantly in muscle or translocated in response to muscle contraction. $#Educational objective# Glucose uptake in skeletal muscle occurs primarily via glucose transporter (GLUT) 4.  Muscle contraction and insulin induce translocation of GLUT4 to the cell surface, increasing glucose uptake during exercise and the fed state, respectively.  Over time, regular exercise causes increased expression of GLUT4, leading to increased skeletal muscle glucose uptake at any given insulin level and therefore lower blood glucose levels.  ",

Patients with pancreatogenic diabetes (eg, secondary to chronic pancreatitis) also typically have inadequate alpha cell reserve and can experience frequent hypoglycemia. $#(Choice A)#  Progressive hypoglycemia prompts a catecholamine (eg, epinephrine) surge, which increases hepatic glucose production and triggers many of the characteristic hypoglycemic symptoms (eg, arousal, tremor).  Patients with long-standing diabetes often have a blunted autonomic response to hypoglycemia, with #reduced hypoglycemic awareness#, but catecholamines are less important than glucagon in raising blood glucose levels. $#(Choice C)#  Prolonged hypoglycemia can stimulate secretion of cortisol and growth hormone, which increase glucose levels.  These hormones typically act over longer timescales (eg, days/weeks) and are less important than glucagon in preventing acute hypoglycemia. $#(Choice D)#  Chronic exposure to high circulating insulin levels leads to downregulation of insulin receptors and reduced insulin sensitivity.  This effect promotes hyperglycemia, not hypoglycemia. $#(Choice E)#  Repeated hypoglycemia causes downregulation of beta-adrenergic receptors, which contributes to reduced hypoglycemic awareness.  Depending on the systems involved, upregulation of beta-adrenergic receptors would generally reduce hypoglycemia and increase awareness. $#Educational objective# Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus are at increased risk of hypoglycemia because exogenous insulin will continue to be absorbed from the injection site despite falling glucose levels.

Thyroid hormone exists in 2 primary forms:  T4 (thyroxine), the predominant form secreted by the thyroid, and T3 (triiodothyronine), the more active form produced mainly by deiodination of T4 in peripheral tissues. $This patient has a very typical presentation of #primary hypothyroidism# with weight gain, fatigue, and a delayed relaxation phase of deep tendon reflexes.  Her diffuse goiter suggests chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto) thyroiditis, which is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in developed countries.  As autoimmune destruction of the gland progresses, thyroid hormone production declines, leading to loss of feedback inhibition of TSH secretion; therefore, patients have #low T4# and #elevated TSH# levels.  However, because T3 is produced mainly in peripheral tissues and has a short half-life, serum T3 levels fluctuate widely and correlate poorly with clinical status; #T3 is often normal# in primary hypothyroidism. $#(Choice B)#  TSH secretion is very sensitive to changes in thyroid status and rises in response to even small declines in thyroid hormone production.  Subclinical hypothyroidism is a common biochemical state in which an elevated TSH is necessary to maintain normal thyroid hormone levels.  However, most patients are asymptomatic. $#(Choices C, E, and F)#  Primary hyperthyroidism (eg, Graves disease) is characterized by elevated thyroid hormone levels and suppressed TSH.  Subclinical hyperthyroidism is characterized by suppressed TSH with normal thyroid hormone levels.  Central (secondary) hyperthyroidism (eg, TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma) shows elevated levels of both TSH and thyroid hormone.  Common clinical features of hyperthyroidism (primary or secondary) include weight loss, heat intolerance, and tachycardia; patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism may be asymptomatic or have mild symptoms.  T3 levels correlate with clinical status in hyperthyroidism more closely than in hypothyroidism and are often elevated. $#(Choice D)#  Euthyroid sick syndrome is a constellation of abnormal thyroid tests seen in patients with severe systemic illness (eg, sepsis).  Excess cortisol, inflammatory cytokines, starvation, and certain medications (eg, amiodarone) can cause reduced conversion of T4 to T3, leading to low serum T3; reverse T3 (the inactive metabolite of T4) is typically elevated but TSH and T4 are usually normal. $#Educational objective# Primary hypothyroidism is characterized by decreased T4 levels and increased TSH.  T3 is primarily produced by conversion from T4 in peripheral tissues; serum levels widely fluctuate due to its short half life, and can often be within the normal range in patients with hypothyroidism.

  "explanation_2": "$The hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis functions as follows: $• Thyroid hormone is released primarily as thyroxine (T4), with deiodination to triiodothyronine (T3) (the more active form) in peripheral tissues. $• Synthesis of thyroid hormone is driven by TSH secretion from the pituitary. $• TSH is regulated by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamus. $• Secretion of both TRH and TSH is subject to negative feedback by T3. $#Hyperthyroidism# typically presents with fatigue, weight loss, and palpitations associated with elevated thyroid hormone levels.  Hyperadrenergic signs (eg, lid lag, tremor) are also common.  Most patients have primary hyperthyroidism (ie, intrinsic thyroid disorder with increased thyroid hormone release); TSH is low due to feedback suppression. $However, this patient has an #elevated TSH#, suggesting a pituitary etiology (ie, #secondary hyperthyroidism#).  The most common cause of secondary hyperthyroidism is a TSH-secreting #pituitary adenoma#.  The excess TSH causes generalized hypertrophy of the thyroid gland, manifesting as a #diffuse goiter#. $#(Choice A)#  Most thyroid hormone is transported bound to plasma proteins, primarily thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG).  Estrogen (eg, pregnancy, oral contraceptives) causes @increased production of TBG@, which lowers free thyroid hormone levels.  A brief rise in TSH subsequently increases production of thyroid hormone to saturate the increased TBG binding sites, and the patient returns to a euthyroid state.  Total T3 and T4 are elevated, but TSH and free hormone levels are normal. $#(Choices B and C)#  Graves disease is caused by autoantibodies that activate the TSH receptor and induce thyroid hormone production.  Painless thyroiditis is characterized by autoimmune destruction of thyroid follicles with release of preformed thyroid hormone.  Both conditions cause hyperthyroidism with elevated thyroid hormone levels, but TSH is suppressed by feedback inhibition. $#(Choice E)#  Thyroid cancer typically presents with a hard, asymmetric goiter.  Adjacent thyroid tissue may be compressed and nonfunctional, but the contralateral lobe can usually compensate and patients are typically euthyroid.  Thyroid follicular tumors may occasionally cause hyperthyroidism due to autonomous thyroid hormone production, but TSH is suppressed. $#Educational objective# The most common cause of secondary hyperthyroidism is a TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma.  In addition to hyperthyroid symptoms, TSH causes generalized hypertrophy of the thyroid gland (diffuse goiter).  Laboratory evaluation shows elevated levels of thyroid hormone (triiodothyronine and thyroxine) and TSH.  ",

Complete insulin deficiency leads to excessive generation of organic anions (eg, ketone bodies that smell fruity), thereby causing #metabolic acidosis# (ie, decreased serum bicarbonate [HCO3−] and pH). $The kidneys can normally compensate somewhat for metabolic acidosis by increasing renal acid excretion.  The major mechanisms of increased renal acid excretion include: $• #Increased H+ secretion#:  Intracellular acidosis leads to a direct increase in H+ secretion via increased activity of the apical Na+/H+ exchanger. $• #Increased HCO3− reabsorption#:  Carbonic anhydrase in the proximal tubular lumen facilitates reabsorption of filtered HCO3−.  Each reabsorbed HCO3− is equivalent to the secretion of one H+.  In metabolic acidosis, HCO3- is completely reabsorbed from the tubular fluid. $• Increased acid buffer excretion:  Urinary acid buffers, hydrogen phosphate (HPO42−) and ammonia (NH3), are used to trap H+ in the lumen in the form of #H2PO4-# and #NH4+#, vastly increasing the amount of acid that can be #excreted# in the urine.  With chronic acidosis, proximal tubular cells greatly increase NH3 production to increase acid excretion capacity. $#Educational objective# The kidneys can normally compensate somewhat for metabolic acidosis by completely reabsorbing filtered bicarbonate (HCO3-) and excreting excess H+ in the urine.

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) normally equals approximately 125 ml/min, although this number can vary between 90 to 130 by gender and between different subjects.  The GFR depends on the difference in hydrostatic and oncotic pressures between the glomerular capillaries and Bowman's capsule.$",
  "explanation_2": "$Constriction of the efferent arteriole produces a significant increase in glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure because of the reduction in glomerular blood outflow.  This produces a corresponding increase in GFR.  Efferent arteriolar constriction also reduces renal plasma flow (RPF).  The increase in GFR along with the decrease in RPF leads to an increased filtration fraction (FF) because FF=GFR/RPF (choice D). $As RPF decreases, the slower capillary flow allows more time for the filtration of plasma across the glomerular membrane.  This leads to an increased concentration of non-filterable plasma proteins within the glomerular capillaries, thus elevating capillary oncotic pressure.  As efferent arteriolar constriction increases past a certain point, this increase in capillary oncotic pressure begins to oppose, and eventually overwhelm, the increase in capillary hydrostatic pressure also produced by efferent arteriolar constriction.  Thus, when RPF is low secondary to severe efferent arteriolar constriction, the substantially increased capillary oncotic pressure results in an overall decrease in GFR #(choice A).# $#(Choice B)#  Selective constriction of the afferent arteriole decreases plasma flow into the glomerular capillaries, reducing capillary hydrostatic pressure and thus decreasing the GFR.  Constriction of the afferent arteriole results in relatively equal decreases in RPF and GFR (FF=GFR/RPF), so the filtration fraction remains unchanged. $#Educational objective# Selective vasoconstriction of the efferent arteriole (up to certain extent) increases hydrostatic pressure in the glomerular capillaries, and therefore increases the glomerular filtration rate.  As efferent arteriolar constriction continues to increase, the glomerular filtration rate begins to decrease due to a flow-mediated rise in oncotic pressure in the glomerular capillaries.  The filtration fraction always increases with increasing efferent arteriole constriction.  "

However, a bicarbonate of 13 mEq/L is much lower than the @expected secondary compensation@, which indicates a second primary acid-base disorder.  The lower-than-expected serum bicarbonate with a high @anion gap@ [139 − (98 + 13) = 28] is consistent with a concomitant #primary anion gap metabolic acidosis#.  This mixed respiratory alkalosis and anion gap metabolic acidosis is most likely the result of #salicylate poisoning#: $• Primary respiratory alkalosis is due to direct stimulation of the medullary respiratory center by excess salicylate, resulting in both an #increased respiratory rate# and #tidal volume# (ie, increased minute ventilation). $• Primary metabolic acidosis occurs mostly because salicylate uncouples oxidative phosphorylation, which results in #increased production of lactic acid# and ketoacids in peripheral tissues.  Excess salicylic acid in the serum also makes a minor contribution.  The ionized form of these compounds also increases the anion gap (unmeasured anions). $The pH is typically near or within normal range in patients with salicylate poisoning because of the opposing influences of the respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis. $#(Choice A)#  Primary metabolic acidosis and primary metabolic alkalosis can simultaneously develop in the setting of 2 disparate pathologic processes (eg, renal failure and vomiting).  The pH and bicarbonate levels can be increased, normal, or decreased, depending on the severity of the metabolic acidosis compared with the metabolic alkalosis. $#(Choice B)#  Primary metabolic acidosis with primary respiratory acidosis (eg, sepsis and hypoventilatory respiratory failure) typically leads to significant acidemia (very low pH) with low bicarbonate and high PaCO2. $#(Choice D)#  Primary metabolic alkalosis with primary respiratory acidosis (eg, vomiting and hypoventilation due to opioid overdose) is expected to show elevated bicarbonate and PaCO2; the pH can reflect alkalemia or acidemia, depending on the relative severity of the 2 disturbances. $#(Choice E)#  Primary metabolic alkalosis with primary respiratory alkalosis (eg, vomiting and hyperventilation due to anxiety) is expected to cause significant alkalemia (very high pH) with high bicarbonate and low PaCO2. $#Educational objective# Salicylate poisoning causes mixed primary respiratory alkalosis and primary anion gap metabolic acidosis.  Mixed acid-base disturbances can be recognized by inappropriate secondary compensation for one of the primary disturbances, indicating that an additional primary disturbance must be present.  ",

  "explanation_2": "$Free water excretion by the kidney depends primarily on serum vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone) levels.  This hormone acts on the nephron to regulate the osmotic pressure of body fluids by varying the water permeability of the distal portion of the nephron.  Water and electrolyte permeability varies in different regions of the nephron as follows:  $1. Glomerular capillaries are fenestrated and therefore highly permeable to water and other solutes.  The glomeruli collectively filter about 180 L of isotonic fluid (equal to plasma osmolarity) into Bowman's space daily. $2. The proximal convoluted tubule actively reabsorbs electrolytes, glucose, and amino acids.  Water reabsorption in the proximal tubule occurs passively along with transport of solutes into the epithelial cells; thus, tubular fluid remains isotonic.  $3. The loop of Henle is located in the renal medulla, where the interstitium is hypertonic (higher osmolarity than that of plasma).  The descending limb of the loop of Henle is permeable to water, but most of the ions are retained in the lumen #(choice C).#  As water moves into the interstitium, the fluid left in the lumen becomes hypertonic.  $4. The thick and thin ascending limbs of the loop of Henle are impermeable to water.  In the ascending limb, the osmolarity of the tubular fluid decreases due to passive adsorption of NaCl in the thin region as well as active transport of electrolytes out of the lumen by the Na+/K+/2Cl- cotransporter in the thick portion.  $5. Water permeability of the early distal convoluted tubule is also very low, and more electrolytes than water are reabsorbed.  However, water permeability in the late distal tubule can vary based on vasopressin levels #(choice E).#  Urinary pH is regulated chiefly through H+ secretion by intercalated cells in the late distal and collecting tubules.  $6. The water permeability of the cortical and medullary collecting ducts is also regulated by vasopressin #(choice F).#  If the water intake of the individual is high, vasopressin is not released and water permeability of the collecting duct system is low, producing dilute urine.  In contrast, water deprivation stimulates vasopressin secretion, leading to marked reabsorption of water in the collecting ducts and the production of low-volume, high-osmolar urine. $#Educational objective# The ascending limb of the loop of Henle is impermeable to water regardless of serum vasopressin levels.  Reabsorption of electrolytes by the Na+/K+/2Cl- cotransporter occurs in the thick ascending limb and contributes to formation of the corticomedullary concentration gradient.  "

In addition, patients with advanced CKD typically have decreased renal conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (the more active form) because of inadequate function of renal tissue.  The resulting #hypocalcemia#, along with hyperphosphatemia, stimulates the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and leads to #secondary hyperparathyroidism#. $#(Choice B)#  Primary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia (due to increased renal excretion of phosphorus), and increased renal production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.  In secondary hyperparathyroidism due to CKD, PTH is high but serum phosphate is elevated and hypercalcemia would not be seen. $#(Choice C)#  Hypoparathyroidism is characterized by hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and decreased renal production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.  Hypoparathyroidism is usually caused by autoimmune disease or iatrogenic injury to the parathyroid glands during neck surgery. $#(Choice D)#  Vitamin D deficiency (ie, low 25-hydroxyvitamin D) causes decreased absorption of dietary calcium and leads to hypocalcemia.  The resulting increase in PTH (secondary hyperparathyroidism) causes decreased renal reabsorption of phosphate, leading to hypophosphatemia.  1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D levels are typically low, although the increased renal conversion due to PTH may restore levels to within laboratory norms. $#(Choice E)#  Elevated 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels can be seen in granulomatous diseases (eg, sarcoidosis) and in excess intake of calcitriol supplements, and lead to increased intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate (with hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia) and suppression of PTH. $#Educational objective# Chronic kidney disease can cause hyperphosphatemia due to impaired renal excretion of phosphorus.  Elevated blood phosphate triggers the release of fibroblast growth factor 23, which lowers calcitriol production and intestinal calcium absorption.  The resulting hypocalcemia, along with hyperphosphatemia, leads to secondary hyperparathyroidism.  "

In response to low perfusion pressures, the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney synthesize renin, which converts angiotensinogen (synthesized in the liver) to angiotensin I.  Angiotensin-converting enzyme, which is synthesized largely in the lungs, then converts angiotensin I to its active form, angiotensin II. $#Angiotensin II# has multiple actions to increase systemic blood pressure.  It directly #increases systemic vascular# resistance through generalized arteriolar vasoconstriction #(choice B).#  It also increases sodium and water reabsorption both directly, by increasing sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule, and indirectly, by stimulating #aldosterone# synthesis in the adrenal cortex and antidiuretic hormone in the hypothalamus #(choice A).#  Elevated systemic pressure and blood volume help overcome the decreased perfusion pressures in the stenotic kidney and maintain a near-normal filtration rate. $However, the #unaffected kidney# is exposed to elevated systemic pressures, resulting in #increased sodium excretion# due to a pressure natriuresis effect.  Although this helps reduce circulating volume, many patients with renal artery stenosis have #chronic hypertension# due to persistent hyperreninemia and angiotensin II–induced vasoconstriction caused by the stenotic kidney. $#(Choice C)#  After placement of the clip, glomerular filtration rate will drop in the stenotic kidney, triggering compensatory RAAS activation.  This increases the perfusion pressure of the stenotic kidney, helping to normalize glomerular filtration rate.  However, like most compensatory responses, the increase in filtration caused by RAAS activation is not enough to overcome the initial drop in filtration caused by clip placement.  Therefore, the filtration rate remains less than normal in the stenotic kidney. $#(Choice D)#  Renin production is suppressed in the unaffected kidney due to its exposure to elevated systemic pressures. $#Educational objective# Unilateral renal artery stenosis causes hypoperfusion and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.  Angiotensin II causes arteriolar vasoconstriction and increases aldosterone and antidiuretic hormone synthesis.

Stimulation of the V1 receptor causes vasoconstriction and increased prostaglandin release; stimulation of the V2 receptor results in an antidiuretic response.  ADH is secreted in response to plasma hyperosmolality and, to a lesser extent, depletion of the effective circulating volume.  Water deprivation initially increases plasma osmolality, resulting in increased ADH secretion.  This causes the kidney to produce concentrated urine, which helps to counteract the rise in plasma osmolality by reducing urinary free water excretion. $The medullary portion of the collecting duct is of particular importance in the production of maximally concentrated urine as the medullary interstitium is the region of highest @osmolarity@ in the kidney.  In the setting of high serum ADH levels, a large osmotic gradient drives the absorption of free water into the hypertonic medullary interstitium.  As water leaves the tubular fluid, urea concentration greatly increases.  ADH also increases the number of passive urea transporters in the inner medullary collecting duct, allowing a substantial fraction of the highly concentrated urea to diffuse down its concentration gradient into the medullary interstitium.  When ADH levels are high, this urea resorption contributes up to 50% of total osmolarity of the medulla, further increasing the water-absorbing capacity of the nephron. $#(Choice A)#  ADH also increases water absorption in the cortical segment of the collecting duct, reducing the amount of free water delivered to the medullary collecting duct.  This prevents excess water from being absorbed into the medullary interstitium, which would otherwise dilute the osmotic gradient and reduce the maximum achievable urine concentration. $#(Choice B)#  The early distal tubule is impermeable to both water and urea. $#(Choice D)#  The proximal tubule is permeable to urea and resorbs about half of the filtered load.  However, it does not respond to ADH. $#(Choice E)#  The thin ascending limb of the loop of Henle is permeable to urea, which passively diffuses down its concentration gradient into the tubular lumen.  Secretion of urea into the thin part of the loop of Henle allows urea to recirculate and concentrate in the tubular system, further increasing its contribution to the medullary osmotic gradient. $#Educational objective# Antidiuretic hormone acts on the medullary segment of the collecting duct to increase urea and water reabsorption, allowing for the production of maximally concentrated urine.

This will decrease RPF, but will increase glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure as the fluid \"backs up\" in the glomerulus, increasing hydrostatic pressure.  This increased glomerular hydrostatic pressure will cause an increase in the filtration fraction. $The renal plasma flow (RPF) is the volume of plasma that is delivered to the kidney per unit time.  The RPF is provided by the renal blood flow, which delivers both erythrocytes and plasma to the kidney.  The RPF is theoretically calculated by subtracting the amount of erythrocytes (hematocrit) from the total renal blood flow.  Clinically, however, RPF is generally estimated by calculating the paraaminohippuric acid (PAH) clearance.  RPF is linked to the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and the filtration fraction (FF) by the following equation: $\u2003\u2003 FF = GFR / RPF $The filtration fraction refers to the proportion of the RPF that is filtered from the glomerular capillaries into Bowman's space and is expressed as a percentage.  Using the equation above, one can observe that increases in GFR or decreases in RPF will increase the FF.  The GFR is dependent on hydrostatic and oncotic pressures in the glomerular capillaries and Bowman’s space and can be calculated with the following equation: $\u2003\u2003 \\( {\\small GFR = K_f \\Big( (P_G - P_B) - (\\pi_G - \\pi_B) \\Big)} \\) $ Where Kf refers to the coefficient of filtration, PG refers to the hydrostatic pressure in the glomerular capillaries, PB refers to the hydrostatic pressure in Bowman's space, πG refers to the oncotic pressure in the glomerular capillaries and πB refers to the oncotic pressure in Bowman's space.

  "explanation_2": "$Patients with #chronic kidney disease# (CKD) often develop symptomatic anemia (eg, fatigue, exertional dyspnea) as the glomerular filtration rate declines.  Most cases are due to the #inadequate secretion of erythropoietin# (EPO), a glycoprotein hormone produced by #peritubular fibroblasts in the renal cortex# in response to tissue hypoxia (as is seen with anemia).  EPO acts on erythrocyte precursor cells (erythroid colony–forming unit cells) in the bone marrow to stimulate red blood cell differentiation and survival. $Healthy patients increase EPO levels up to 10,000-fold in response to anemia, but patients with CKD have chronic inflammatory damage to renal EPO-producing cells and are often unable to generate sufficient EPO to maintain red blood cell counts.  These individuals are often treated with #synthetic EPO agents# (eg, epoetin, darbepoetin) to stimulate erythrocyte production.  As iron is rapidly consumed to make red blood cells, individuals treated with EPO agents are often also given iron supplementation to prevent the development of iron deficiency anemia. $In adults, approximately 80% of EPO is generated in the kidney; the remainder is largely generated in the liver by hepatocytes and Ito perisinusoidal cells. $#(Choices A and C)#  Decreased renal perfusion and glomerular filtration leads to decreased solute delivery to the @juxtaglomerular apparatus@ in the distal tubule, which stimulates renin secretion by juxtaglomerular cells.  Activation of the @renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system@ leads to increased production of angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor that preferentially constricts the efferent arteriole to restore glomerular filtration.  These hormones do not have a substantial effect on red cell production. $#(Choices B and E)#  Foot processes of renal podocytes surround glomerular capillaries to prevent filtration of large molecules (eg, plasma proteins); defects can cause chronic proteinuric kidney disease (eg, minimal change disease).  Epithelial cells of the proximal tubule have a prominent role in reabsorption and secretion of solutes into the urine; these cells have high metabolic activity and are therefore susceptible to ischemic injury (eg, acute tubular necrosis) due to inadequate renal perfusion and oxygen delivery.  However, neither of these cell types produces EPO. $#Educational objective# Erythropoietin (EPO) is produced primarily by peritubular fibroblast cells in the renal cortex in response to decreased renal oxygen delivery (eg, decreased blood hemoglobin content).  EPO acts on erythrocyte precursor cells in the bone marrow to stimulate red blood cell production.

  "explanation_2": "$Serum creatinine is the most common indicator of kidney function in clinical use.  Steady-state creatinine levels are a result of the balance between creatinine synthesis in the muscle and excretion via glomerular filtration and proximal tubule secretion.  For the most part, creatinine synthesis and tubular secretion remain relatively constant.  As a result, serum creatinine levels depend primarily on the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). $The relationship between serum creatinine and GFR is nonlinear.  A person's serum creatinine can be essentially normal even after a 50% loss of kidney function (ie, following kidney donation or unilateral nephrectomy).  Serum creatinine levels begin to rise significantly as the GFR declines to <60 mL/min (assuming no change in muscle mass).  As the GFR continues to decline, the slope of the creatinine-GFR curve steepens.  Consequently, when the GFR is significantly decreased, small decrements in GFR produce relatively large changes in serum creatinine.  However, when the GFR is normal, relatively large decreases in GFR result in only small increases in serum creatinine.  Serum creatinine is therefore an insensitive indicator for decreasing GFR when creatinine levels are normal. $#Educational objective# When the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is normal, relatively large decreases in GFR result in only small increases in serum creatinine.  Conversely, when the GFR is significantly decreased, small decrements in GFR produce relatively large changes in serum creatinine.  A good rule of thumb is that every time GFR halves, serum creatinine doubles.  "

The abrupt loss of resorptive stimulus can lead to rapid bone formation, resulting in hypophosphatemia and hypocalcemia.  However, this patient has not yet undergone parathyroidectomy. $#(Choice C)#  Phosphate binders (eg, sevelamer) are synthetic polymers that bind intestinal phosphate and are subsequently eliminated in the feces.  They are used to lower plasma phosphorus in patients with hyperphosphatemia due to chronic kidney disease.  In patients not taking these medications, most phosphorus is eliminated in the urine and very little in the feces. $#(Choice D)#  Phosphate is filtered at the glomerulus and reabsorbed in the absence of PTH.  Hyperparathyroidism results in decreased reabsorption in the proximal tubule; however, phosphate is not secreted. $#(Choice E)#  Reintroduction of carbohydrates in chronically malnourished patients (eg, anorexia nervosa) leads to a surge in insulin, which drives phosphorus intracellularly for use in cellular metabolism (ie, ATP production).  This causes refeeding syndrome, characterized by severe hypophosphatemia, weakness, rhabdomyolysis, and arrhythmias.  This patient's mild hypercalcemia and constipation are more suggestive of hyperparathyroidism. $#Educational objective# Primary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by oversecretion of parathyroid hormone despite normal (or elevated) serum calcium levels.

  "explanation_2": "$This investigational drug causes a dose-dependent increase in serum calcium and urine phosphate excretion, which resembles the activity of #parathyroid hormone# (PTH). $PTH receptors are located on osteoblasts (not osteoclasts), and activation causes osteoblasts to increase production of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANK-L) and monocyte colony-stimulating factor.  These factors stimulate osteoclastic precursors to differentiate into bone-resorbing osteoclasts.  PTH also decreases the release of osteoprotegerin (OPG), a decoy receptor for RANK-L; therefore, lower levels of OPG allow for more interaction between RANK-L and the osteoclastic receptor, #increasing bone resorption# and #releasing calcium and phosphate# into circulation.  In the kidney, PTH #decreases tubular reabsorption of phosphorus# while increasing reabsorption of calcium.  Therefore, the combined effects are #increased serum calcium# and #urine phosphate levels#. $Chronically high levels of PTH (ie, hyperparathyroidism) increase the risk of osteoporosis.  However, intermittent administration of recombinant PTH analogs induces a greater increase in osteoblast activity in proportion to osteoclast activity and a net increase in new bone formation.  Teriparatide is a recombinant PTH analog used to treat osteoporosis. $#(Choice A)#  PTH increases renal conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, which increases intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate and decreases PTH secretion via negative feedback.  1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D analogs (eg, calcipotriol) can raise serum calcium to some extent, but suppression of PTH limits the degree of phosphate excretion in the urine. $#(Choice B)#  PTH increases renal phosphate excretion by inducing internalization and destruction of type IIa sodium/phosphate cotransporters (NPT2) in the proximal renal tubule.  Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is a hormone produced by osteocytes that acts synergistically with PTH to increase phosphate excretion by downregulating NPT2 gene expression.  Investigational FGF23 inhibitors reduce renal phosphate excretion. $#(Choices C and D)#  Bisphosphonates (eg, alendronate, risedronate) are pyrophosphate analogs that attach to hydroxyapatite binding sites on bone surfaces and inhibit osteoclast-mediated bone resorption.  Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody that decreases bone resorption by binding to RANK-L and blocking the interaction between RANK-L and RANK on osteoclast surfaces.  These agents generally lower, rather than raise, serum calcium levels. $#Educational objective# Parathyroid hormone (PTH) causes increased bone resorption, increased serum calcium levels, and increased renal phosphate excretion.

As a result, the urinary excretion of these substances is dependent on the glomerular filtration rate and remains equal to the filtered load of the substance regardless of the serum concentration (note that urinary excretion of creatinine is slightly more than the filtered rate due to tubular secretion). $#(Choice E)#  Urea is filtered and then reabsorbed by passive diffusion into the peritubular capillaries.  Approximately 20%-50% of the filtered load is normally reabsorbed.  Urea has no Tmax because it is passively reabsorbed. $#Educational objective# At normal plasma concentrations of glucose, the renal tubules reabsorb the entire filtered load of glucose because it is below the maximum tubular reabsorption ability (transport maximum of glucose).  At higher plasma concentrations, glucose is excreted when the filtered amount exceeds the transport maximum.  The serum concentration at which glucosuria begins, called the threshold of glucose, is approximately 200 mg/dL.  "

  "explanation_2": "$Polyuria that resolves with the administration of desmopressin (DDAVP, synthetic analogue of vasopressin) is likely secondary to deficient vasopressin secretion (central diabetes insipidus).  #Vasopressin# produces a V2 receptor-mediated increase in water permeability within the cortical and medullary collecting ducts.  As water leaves the tubular fluid, urea concentration greatly increases in these tubular segments.  Although the cortical collecting duct is impermeable to urea, vasopressin activates urea transporters in the #medullary collecting duct#, increasing urea reabsorption and #decreasing renal urea clearance#.  This passive reabsorption of urea into the medullary interstitium in the presence of ADH significantly increases the medullary osmotic gradient, allowing the production of maximally concentrated urine. $#(Choice A)#  The majority of filtered calcium is passively absorbed in the proximal tubule and ascending limb of Henle's loop.  Further calcium reabsorption by the distal and collecting ducts is stimulated by parathyroid hormone (not vasopressin). $#(Choice B)#  Creatinine is freely filtered by the glomerulus, and a small amount is also secreted by the proximal tubule.  No further secretion or reabsorption occurs beyond the proximal tubule. $#(Choice C)#  Glucose is filtered in the glomerulus and fully reabsorbed in the proximal tubule as long as the filtered glucose is lower than the transport maximum (Tm).  Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) receptor inhibitors act on the tubular receptors to lower the Tm of glucose and may be used as third-line agents in type 2 diabetes mellitus. $#(Choice D)#  Para-amino hippuric (PAH) acid is filtered in the glomerulus and nearly completely secreted by the proximal tubules without significant tubular reabsorption.  PAH clearance depends on renal plasma flow.  Unlike vasopressin, desmopressin selectively activates V2 receptors and does not cause vasoconstriction (mediated by V1 receptors). $#Educational objective# Vasopressin and desmopressin cause a V2 receptor-mediated increase in water and urea permeability at the inner medullary collecting duct.  The resulting rise in urea reabsorption (decreased urea clearance) enhances the medullary osmotic gradient, allowing the production of maximally concentrated urine.  "

Therefore, factors that reduce renal drug excretion and lead to increased plasma drug levels include the following: $• #Reduced glomerular filtration:#  Kidney disease (eg, chronic kidney disease from diabetes mellitus) and reduced renal blood flow (eg, NSAID-induced vasoconstriction, volume contraction) lead to reduced drug filtration.  In addition, plasma proteins are not filtered at the glomerulus; therefore, highly protein-bound drugs are not effectively filtered. $• #Reduced renal tubular secretion:#  Active transport of drugs is largely dependent on transporters (eg, organic anion or cation transporter).  Coadministration of drugs with overlapping substrate specificity can result in competition for or inhibition of transporters. $• #Increased renal tubular reabsorption:#  Only polarized (ionized) drugs are water soluble, whereas nonionized forms are lipid soluble and can passively diffuse across the renal tubular membrane to reenter the plasma.  Therefore, alterations in urine pH can augment drug excretion; for example, acidification of urine favors the reabsorption of acidic drugs because a greater proportion of the drug is in the nonionized form. $The urinary excretion rate of drug X was reduced from 75 to 50 mg/min after the administration of drug Y.

If the flow of blood through the pulmonary circulation is less than the flow of blood through the systemic circulation, the left ventricle would soon empty completely.  Alternately, if the flow of blood is significantly greater in the pulmonary circulation than it is in the systemic circulation, the left ventricle would soon be overloaded. $The major exception to this is the @bronchial circuit@, which supplies oxygen and nutrients to the pulmonary parenchyma from the systemic circulation but drains mostly to the left atrium as opposed to the right atrium (creating a right to left shunt that acts as a partially independent circuit).  However, this typically accounts for <5% of the systemic cardiac output. $#(Choice A)#  The arterial oxygen contents of the pulmonary and systemic circulations are dramatically different due to deoxygenated blood in the pulmonary arterial circulation and oxygenated blood in the systemic arterial circulation. $#(Choice B)#  Although the resistance of the pulmonary vasculature may be increased in some circumstances (eg, high altitudes, idiopathic pulmonary hypertension), the arterial resistance in the systemic circulation is considerably higher in all scenarios. $#(Choices D, E, and F)#  The mean arterial pressure, diastolic arterial pressure, and driving pressure for blood flow (difference between mean arterial and venous pressures) are considerably different in the pulmonary and systemic circulations both at rest and during exercise.  The normal mean systemic arterial pressure ranges between 70-100 mm Hg and the normal mean pulmonary arterial pressure is approximately 14 mm Hg, whereas venous pressures in both circuits approach 0 mm Hg.

Voltage-dependent calcium channels (L-type) are activated during phase 2 of cardiac action potential (depolarization) and permit influx of calcium into the cardiac myocytes #(choice E).#  This initial calcium influx is sensed by the ryanodine receptors in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which triggers further release of Ca2+ (calcium-induced calcium release) into the cytoplasm, thereby increasing intracellular calcium concentration 100-fold #(choice C).#  The calcium released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum diffuses through the myofilament network and binds to troponin C #(choice D).#  @Tropomyosin@ is then moved out of the way so that actin and myosin can interact, leading to muscle contraction. $The final stage of #excitation#-contraction coupling is #myocyte relaxation#, which occurs subsequent to #calcium efflux# from the cytoplasm.  Intracellular calcium is removed primarily via an #Na+/Ca2+ exchange pump# (NCX) and sarcoplasmic reticulum #Ca2+-ATPase pump# (SERCA).  NCX uses the large extracellular Na+ concentration gradient to help pump Ca2+ out of the cell and, in the process, removes one intracellular Ca2+ in exchange for 3 extracellular Na+ ions.  In contrast, SERCA is a Ca2+-ATPase pump that actively transfers Ca2+ from the cytosol to the lumen of sarcoplasmic reticulum at the expense of ATP hydrolysis. $#(Choice A)#  Calmodulin (#cal#cium #modul#ated protein) is a calcium-binding messenger protein that is present in all cells and mediates many of the regulatory effects of Ca2+.  Calmodulin is important for excitation-contraction coupling in smooth muscle cells, which lack troponin, unlike cardiac and skeletal muscles.  In cardiac muscle, calmodulin is not directly involved in excitation-contraction coupling; rather, it helps regulate intracellular calcium activity and transcription factor signaling. $#Educational objective# Calcium efflux from cardiac cells prior to relaxation is primarily mediated via an Na+/Ca2+ exchange pump and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase pump.

The inability of aortic valve leaflets to effectively close during diastole leads to regurgitation of blood back into the left ventricular (LV) cavity with an increase in LV end-diastolic volume and wall stress.  The resultant chamber enlargement and eccentric hypertrophy increase total stroke volume, which is often felt as a sense of pounding or an uncomfortable feeling of heartbeat (especially when lying on the left side). $Physical examination reveals an early \"blowing\" #diastolic decrescendo murmur# best heard at the left sternal border in the third or fourth intercostal space.  The precordial impulse is hyperdynamic and displaced laterally and downward.  #Bounding femoral and carotid pulses#, marked by abrupt distension and quick collapse (\"water-hammer\" pulses), are the result of the wide pulse pressure.  Some patients exhibit #head bobbing# with carotid pulsations (de Musset sign) due to transfer of momentum from the large LV stroke volume to the head and neck.  Significant systolic pulsations may also be noticed in other organs (eg, liver, spleen, retina) and the fingertips. $#(Choice B)#  Patients with severe aortic stenosis have a characteristic arterial pulse – small pulse amplitude (pulsus parvus) with a delayed peak and slower upstroke of the arterial pulse (pulsus tardus) due to diminished stroke volume and prolonged ejection time. $#(Choice C)#  The presence of atrial septal defect leads to left-to-right intracardiac shunting, which can cause a hyperdynamic right ventricular impulse.  It does not cause any significant change in arterial pulse character. $#(Choice D)#  Coarctation of the aorta causes systolic hypertension in the upper extremities along with characteristic diminished and/or delayed femoral pulses (brachial-femoral delay). $#(Choice E)#  Arterial pulse, pulse pressure, and forward stroke volume remain normal in patients with chronic (compensated) mitral regurgitation. $#(Choice F)#  Arterial pulses are reduced in volume and amplitude in patients with mitral stenosis due to decreased LV end-diastolic volume and stroke volume. $#(Choices G and H)#  Tricuspid regurgitation and/or pulmonary stenosis are right-sided valvular lesions and do not cause any specific arterial pulse pattern on physical examination. $#Educational objective# Aortic regurgitation causes an increase in total stroke volume with abrupt distension and rapid falloff of peripheral arterial pulses, resulting in a wide pulse pressure.

However, the drop in intrathoracic pressure also increases pulmonary vessel capacity, leading to a transient decrease in left ventricular venous return.  As a result, a TR murmur would be expected to increase in intensity during inspiration (Carvallo sign), whereas murmurs associated with MR or VSD would either decrease or not change.

Normal LV mass and cavity size with preserved EF and impaired relaxation describe restrictive cardiomyopathy; the LV walls are stiff but not typically thickened.  Both conditions are likely to lead to symptomatic heart failure with jugular venous distension and pulmonary edema (evidenced by crackles on lung auscultation). $#(Choice B)#  Increased LV mass with normal relaxation and normal (or somewhat increased) LV cavity size and ejection fraction are consistent with athlete's heart, in which physiologic cardiac changes (eg, LV cavity enlargement and wall thickening) improve cardiac function in response to intense endurance training.  A systolic flow murmur may be heard but does not decrease in intensity with maneuvers that increase LV blood volume. $#(Choice C)#  Increased LV mass with small LV cavity size, decreased EF, and impaired relaxation occur in severe aortic stenosis.  The fixed obstruction created by the stenotic valve leads to pressure overload and concentric LV hypertrophy, and also restricts stroke volume to decrease EF.  The murmur of aortic stenosis is similar to that of HCM but is differentiated by a decrease in intensity with maneuvers that decrease, rather than increase, LV preload (eg, abrupt standing, Valsalva strain phase). $#Educational objective# Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) typically involves interventricular septal hypertrophy that obstructs left ventricular (LV) outflow and creates a systolic murmur that decreases in intensity with maneuvers that increase LV blood volume (eg, handgrip, passive leg elevation).

Increased levels of both adenosine and nitric oxide act on vascular smooth muscle to stimulate #vasodilation#, allowing for a relative increase in coronary blood flow at the new, lower perfusion pressure (ie, coronary blood flow is maintained).

Decreased cardiac contractility leads to reduced cardiac output and hypotension.  In response, systemic vascular resistance is increased (via peripheral vasoconstriction) to maintain blood pressure.  The LV systolic failure increases LV end-diastolic pressure, which is transmitted backward to increase pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and pulmonary arterial pressure.  ",

During pulmonary artery (right heart) catheterization, the catheter is advanced to a small branch of the pulmonary artery and the balloon is inflated to obstruct blood flow in that vessel and its distal branches (which eventually form the pulmonary veins).  Because blood flow toward the left atrium (LA) is obstructed beyond this point of occlusion, the pressure at the tip of the \"wedged\" catheter becomes nearly equal to the LA pressure and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP).  This is referred to as the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP). $During @normal diastole@, the LA pressure is nearly equal to the LVEDP as the open mitral valve offers minimal resistance to flow between the 2 chambers.  In patients with #mitral stenosis#, there is resistance to blood flow from the LA to LV that leads to an #increase# in the #LA pressure#.  This increase in LA pressure is transmitted back to the pulmonary veins and is recorded as #elevated PCWP# during pulmonary artery catheterization.  If the LA pressure is sufficiently high to overcome the resistance between the LA and LV, LV filling may not be significantly affected, resulting in #normal LVEDP#. $#(Choice A)#  Aortic stenosis causes a pressure gradient between LV and aortic peak systolic pressures.  LVEDP and PCWP can be elevated in patients with aortic stenosis; however, both these values would remain in approximately the same range. $#(Choice B)#  Cardiac tamponade leads to equalization of average intracardiac diastolic pressures (left ventricular, right ventricular, and pulmonary artery diastolic pressures).  LVEDP and PCWP are both elevated to a similar degree. $#(Choices C and E)#  Both dilated and restrictive cardiomyopathy are associated with pulmonary and systemic venous congestion, resulting in a similar increase in both LVEDP and PCWP.  In dilated cardiomyopathy, this occurs due to systolic dysfunction (impaired ventricular contractility), whereas in restrictive cardiomyopathy this occurs due to diastolic dysfunction (impaired ventricular relaxation/filling). $#Educational objective# Under normal circumstances, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) closely reflects left atrial (LA) and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP).  Mitral stenosis leads to an increase in the LA pressure that is reflected as elevated PCWP during pulmonary artery catheterization.  Left ventricular filling may be normal, resulting in an increased pressure gradient between the LA and LV during diastole.  ",

  "explanation_2": "$Cardiac catheterization is performed to evaluate for cardiac etiologies and obtain direct measurements of intracardiac pressures in patients with unexplained symptoms.  In general, right-sided pressures are much lower than those of the left side as the right ventricle is pumping blood into a much lower resistance pulmonary vasculature. $A balloon-tipped pulmonary artery (PA) @catheter@ (attached distally to a pressure transducer) is inserted into the subclavian or internal jugular vein.  When the PA catheter enters the superior vena cava (SVC), a venous waveform appears, and the balloon is inflated with air and the catheter is advanced.  The location of the catheter tip is determined by the @pressure readings@ as follows:  $1. The venous pressure waveform of the SVC appears as small-amplitude oscillations.  The pressure remains unchanged as the catheter is advanced into the right atrium (RA).  Normal pressure in the SVC and RA is 1-6 mm Hg #(choice D).#  $2. As the catheter is advanced across the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle (RV), a pulsatile waveform appears.  The peak (systolic) pressure is the strength of right ventricular contraction, and the lowest (diastolic) pressure is just below the RA pressure.  RV systolic pressure is normally 15-30 mm Hg.  $3. As the catheter advances across the pulmonic valve into a main pulmonary artery, the pressure waveform shows a sudden increase in diastolic pressure with no change in systolic pressure.  This rise in diastolic pressure is due to pulmonary capillary resistance and backward transmission of left atrial pressure.  The PA diastolic pressure is normally 6-12 mm Hg #(choice C).#  $4. When the catheter is advanced into the distal PA branches, a venous type waveform appears; this is called the PA occlusion pressure or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP).  This pressure is reflective of venous pressure in the left heart (left atrial pressure and left ventricular diastolic pressure) #(choice A).#  PCWP is usually equal to PA diastolic pressure (6-12 mm Hg). $#(Choice B)#  Left-sided pressures are much higher than right heart pressures in order to maintain systemic perfusion.  The normal left ventricular systolic pressure is approximately 90-140 mm Hg with a left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 6-12 mm Hg. $#Educational objective# Right-sided pressures in the heart are lower than left-sided pressures due to lower resistance in the pulmonary vasculature.  Right ventricular diastolic pressure is similar to right atrial/central venous pressure (1-6 mm Hg), whereas pulmonary artery diastolic pressure is slightly higher (6-12 mm Hg) due to resistance to flow in the pulmonary circulation.

This also results in an increase in systolic blood pressure, which helps improve perfusion of actively contracting skeletal muscle #(choice D).#  However, the rise in the mean arterial pressure is much lower due to an #overall decrease in systemic vascular resistance#.  This occurs due to the substantial arteriolar vasodilation in active skeletal muscles, which is mediated by local release of adenosine, potassium ions, ATP, CO2, and lactate. $#(Choice B)#  Left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic volume and pressure both rise during exercise due to an increase in LV filling (increased venous return) by peripheral vasoconstriction and the pumping actions of actively contracting muscles. $#(Choice C)#  Pulmonary artery systolic pressure typically rises during exercise; however, similar to systemic circulation, the rise in pulmonary pressure is much smaller than the increase in blood flow across the pulmonary circulation due to a fall in pulmonary vascular resistance. $#Educational objective# Exercising muscles can receive up to 85% of the total cardiac output during periods of strenuous activity.

Increased sympathetic tone often contributes to hypertension in patients age <50, but sympathetic tone decreases with age due to reduced responsiveness of adrenergic receptors. $#Educational objective# The isolated systolic hypertension commonly seen in elderly patients results from age-related stiffening (ie, replacement of elastin with collagen) and reduced compliance of the aorta and other large arteries.

Because thrombi are too large to pass through the pulmonary capillaries, paradoxical embolization typically occurs via an #intracardiac right-to-left shunt#.  In this case, echocardiography did not reveal overt septal abnormalities (ie, atrial or ventricular septal defect), raising strong suspicion for a #patent foramen ovale# (PFO). $PFO is common, affecting up to 30% of adults.  It results from failure of the septum primum and septum secundum to fuse during early childhood, creating a #one-way valve#.  This valve is forced closed when left atrial pressure exceeds right atrial pressure (which is most of the time), but it opens when right atrial pressure #exceeds# left atrial pressure, allowing for @transient right-to-left shunting@. $In testing for a PFO, normal saline bubbles are injected intravenously, and echocardiography is performed to observe whether the bubbles pass from the right into the left atrium.  The @release phase@ of the #Valsalva maneuver# increases venous return to the right atrium and consequently increases right atrial pressure to facilitate right-to-left shunting of saline bubbles.  In contrast, the strain phase of Valsalva maneuver decreases venous return to the right atrium and discourages shunting through a PFO. $#(Choices A, B, and C)#  Medications and physiologic maneuvers that reduce venous return to the right atrium discourage right-to-left shunting through a PFO.  Abrupt standing from a supine position causes blood to pool in the lower extremities, amyl nitrite (an inhaled nitrite) causes venous vasodilation, and exhalation causes increased intrathoracic pressure (resulting in partial collapse of the inferior vena cava at end-expiration), all of which reduce venous return to the right atrium. $#(Choice D)#  Sustained handgrip increases systemic vascular resistance, increasing pressure in the left ventricle and left atrium and discouraging shunting through a PFO. $#Educational objective# Paradoxical embolization, or passage of a thromboembolism from the venous to the arterial circulation, most commonly occurs through a patent foramen ovale (PFO).  A PFO is a one-way tissue valve in the atrial septum that opens only when right exceeds left atrial pressure; venous return to the right atrium increases during the release (ie, relaxation) phase of the Valsalva maneuver and encourages the PFO to open.

These findings are characteristic of an #atrial septal defect# (ASD), a common congenital heart lesion resulting in an @abnormal connection@ between the right and left atria. $Left atrial pressure is normally slightly higher than in the right atrium due to the greater compliance of the thin-walled right ventricle; as a result, ASDs cause #left-to-right shunting#.  This blood flow has low velocity and turbulence and therefore does not create a murmur directly.  Instead, the increased volume of blood delivered to the right heart (ie, normal venous return plus extra blood through the shunt) results in #increased blood flow# into the pulmonary arteries across the #pulmonic valve#.  This creates the characteristic early-peaking #midsystolic ejection murmur# over the @left upper sternal border@ (ie, pulmonic flow murmur), as seen in this patient.  Increased blood flow through the tricuspid valve may also cause a diastolic rumble at the left lower sternal border (not present in this patient). $Increased blood flow across the pulmonic valve also accounts for the characteristic ASD finding of a #widely split, fixed S2#.  Under normal conditions, splitting of S2 is heard only during inspiration when there is increased venous return to the right heart.  This results in delayed pulmonic valve closure (P2) relative to aortic valve closure (A2) due to the increased time needed for right ventricular blood ejection.  With ASD, right ventricular volume remains increased throughout the entire respiratory cycle, leading to a @persistently delayed P2@ with no apparent respiratory variation in splitting. $#(Choice A)#  @Aortic stenosis@ causes a crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur over the right second intercostal space.  A2 may be delayed until after P2 (paradoxical splitting) due to the increase in left ventricular ejection time. $#(Choice B)#  @Ventricular septal defects@ create a holosystolic murmur along the left lower sternal border due to a high-pressure, left-to-right shunt.  Splitting of S2 may be widened but is usually not fixed.  Fixed splitting is more typical of ASDs because atrial shunts reduce the normal variation in right ventricular volume during the respiratory cycle (flow through the ASD increases when venous return decreases, minimizing inspiratory/expiratory differences in right ventricular volume). $#(Choice D)#  @Aortic insufficiency@ is characterized by regurgitant blood flow through the aortic valve, resulting in a decrescendo diastolic murmur along the sternal border.  Splitting of S2 is usually not affected. $#Educational objective# An atrial septal defect leads to increased right-sided blood flow due to left-to-right shunting.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and is characterized by #absent P waves, irregularly irregular R-R intervals#, and #narrow QRS complexes#.  Rapid, irregular, low amplitude @fibrillatory waves@ are also frequently seen and represent chaotic, continuous atrial depolarizations. $Atrial fibrillation is initiated by aberrant electrical impulses that arise within regions of heightened atrial excitability (most often the pulmonary veins).  Once triggered, atrial fibrillation induces electrical remodeling of the atria with the development of shortened refractory periods and increased conductivity.  This facilitates the creation and persistence of multiple ectopic foci and reentrant impulses within the atria, increasing the risk and chronicity of subsequent episodes (atrial fibrillation begets atrial fibrillation). $#Ventricular response# in atrial fibrillation is dependent on the transmission rate of abnormal atrial impulses through the #atrioventricular (AV) node#.  Each time the AV node is excited, it enters a #refractory period# during which additional atrial impulses cannot be transmitted to the ventricles; consequently, the majority of atrial impulses never reach the ventricles #(choice A).#  The average ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation usually ranges between 90-170/min.  Because atrial excitation is chaotic, the ventricular rate is irregular with no set intervals between contractions. $#(Choice C)#  Bundle branch conductivity determines the duration of the QRS complexes, which are widened when there is bundle branch block.  It does not affect the ventricular contraction rate. $#(Choice D)#  The Purkinje system can assume pacemaker activity in patients with severe bradycardia (<40 beats per minute), but it would not generate impulses in atrial fibrillation since the ventricular rate is typically elevated. $#(Choice E)#  During atrial fibrillation, the atria are in a state of chaotic, continuous depolarization that is independent of sinoatrial node activity. $#(Choice F)#  The ventricular muscle refractory period does not limit the ventricular contraction rate during AF (the ventricular heart rate can approach 300/min in ventricular tachycardia). $#Educational objective# Atrial fibrillation occurs due to irregular, chaotic electrical activity within the atria and presents with absent P waves, irregularly irregular R-R intervals, and narrow QRS complexes.  The atrioventricular node refractory period regulates the number of atrial impulses that reach the ventricles and determines the ventricular contraction rate in conditions where the atria undergo rapid depolarization.

Once these afferent signals are received by the brainstem cardioregulatory center, some combination of the following effector responses occurs: $• Cardioinhibitory response:  #Increased parasympathetic stimulation# to the sinoatrial and atrioventricular (AV) nodes slows the heart rate.  In addition, decreased sympathetic output to the myocardium decreases myocardial contractility. $• Vasodepressor response:  #Decreased sympathetic output# to vascular smooth muscle causes vasodilation of venous capacitance veins (ie, decreased cardiac preload) and systemic arterioles (ie, decreased perfusion pressure) #(choice C).# $The result of these responses is a brief but profound decrease in cardiac output that leads to hypotension, #decreased cerebral perfusion,# and syncope. $#(Choices A and D)#  Cardiac syncope can occur due to the marked reduction in cardiac output that results from arrhythmia (eg, ventricular tachycardia, AV nodal reentrant tachycardia).

  "explanation_2": "$The above tracing demonstrates the action potential of cardiac pacemaker cells in cardiac #slow-response tissues# such as the #sinoatrial# (SA) and #atrioventricular# (AV) nodes.  The pacemaker action potential includes the following phases: $• Phase 4 (spontaneous depolarization) begins after hyperpolarization triggers the opening of HCN channels that allow slow influx of Na+ (\"funny current\").  T-type (transient) Ca2+ channels then open once the membrane potential becomes more positive, allowing Ca2+ influx to contribute to depolarization.  As the pacemaker cell approaches threshold, #L-type# (long-lasting) #Ca2+ channels begin to open#, which further increases Ca2+ influx and significantly decreases the time until threshold is reached. $• Phase 0 (upstroke) is characterized by continued opening of L-type Ca2+ channels.  In cardiac slow-response tissues, the action potential upstroke is much slower and transitions gradually from phase 4 due to the relatively slow influx of Ca2+ into the cell. $• Phase 3 (repolarization) is characterized by the opening of K+ channels and efflux of K+ from the cell in conjunction with the closure of L-type Ca2+ channels. $This patient's anxiety-provoked episodes of sudden-onset palpitations associated with lightheadedness and shortness of breath are consistent with #paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia#.  Class IV antiarrhythmics (eg, #verapamil#, diltiazem) are commonly used to prevent recurrent nodal tachyarrhythmias such as PSVT.  They work by #blocking L-type calcium channels# in cardiac slow-response tissues, which causes #slowing of phase 4 depolarization# and reduced conduction velocity in the SA and AV nodes. $#(Choice A)#  Verapamil decreases the amount of intracellular calcium available for excitation-contraction coupling within cardiac myocytes.  This reduces myocardial contractility, which can be harmful in patients with impaired ventricular function.  However, the tracing shown in the question stem corresponds to pacemaker action potentials, not cardiac myocyte action potentials. $#(Choices B and C)#  The threshold potential refers to the amount of depolarization required to initiate an action potential.  Class I (sodium channel blockers) and class IV (calcium channel blockers) antiarrhythmics raise the threshold potential of cardiac fast- and slow-response tissues, respectively, by blocking the channels that trigger an action potential.  This effect also results in reduced action potential amplitude, decreased upslope, and reduced impulse conduction speed within the respective tissues. $#(Choice D)#  Verapamil's calcium blocking activity reduces the action potential duration in nodal tissues, but it also increases the refractory period by slowing the recovery of inactivated calcium channels.  Class IA (eg, quinidine) and class III (eg, amiodarone) antiarrhythmics also increase the refractory period by blocking potassium channels and prolonging repolarization. $#Educational objective# Class IV antiarrhythmics (eg, verapamil, diltiazem) are commonly used to prevent recurrent nodal arrhythmias (eg, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia).  They work by blocking calcium channels in slow-response cardiac tissues, slowing phase 4 (spontaneous depolarization) and phase 0 (upstroke).  This reduces impulse conduction velocity in the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes.  "

However, an additional strategy involves augmenting beneficial counter-regulatory mechanisms, such as those involving #natriuretic peptides#. $Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) are released from the myocardium in response to high atrial and ventricular filling pressures (myocardial stretch).  These peptides induce #vasodilation# and #diuresis# (excretion of salt and water) by antagonizing the actions of RAAS and also protect against the deleterious myocardial remodeling and fibrosis that occur in heart failure.

  "explanation_2": "$This child has #Tetralogy of Fallot# (ToF) with ventricular septal defect, overriding aorta, pulmonic stenosis, and right ventricular hypertrophy.  The pulmonic stenosis and overriding aorta cause a relatively low ratio of systemic vascular resistance (SVR) to pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR).  This low SVR:PVR ratio allows the #deoxygenated# right ventricular output to take the low-resistance route to the #systemic# circulation, leading to acute hypoxemia (\"Tet spell\").  Tet spells are most common in infancy but can occur at any age in children with unrepaired ToF.  The mechanism of Tet spells has not been clearly defined but may be caused by acute changes of the infundibular septum leading to more right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. $Children with ToF quickly learn to squat to relieve Tet spells (infants who cannot squat can be placed in the knee-to-chest position by their caregiver).  This posture quickly #increases SVR# without changing PVR, increasing the SVR:PVR ratio.  The increased SVR forces a higher proportion of right ventricular output to enter the pulmonary circulation and oxygenate in the pulmonary capillary beds, increasing arterial oxygen concentration and relieving the Tet spell. $#(Choices A and D)#  Squatting restricts chest wall expansion and slightly increases work of breathing.  Lung compliance is not changed by this positioning. $#(Choices B and C)#  Squatting does not significantly impact PVR as the compressed vessels are primarily in the abdomen and lower extremities.  Pulmonary blood flow increases – not decreases – due to decreased right-to-left shunt with increased SVR. $#Educational objective# In patients with Tetralogy of Fallot, squatting during a Tet spell increases systemic vascular resistance and decreases right-to-left shunting, thereby increasing pulmonary blood flow and improving oxygenation status.

Following significant intravascular volume depletion, baroreceptors in the aorta and carotid arteries rapidly adjust autonomic output to help maintain blood pressure. $Baroreceptors are stretch-sensitive mechanoreceptors that increase their firing rate in response to arterial distension.  These impulses are transmitted to the solitary nucleus, which then modulates sympathetic and parasympathetic output in response to the firing rate. $With an #abrupt decrease# in cardiac output and blood pressure (eg, acute blood loss, standing from a seated position), reduced stretch of the arterial walls leads to #reduced baroreceptor firing# and decreased activation of the solitary nucleus.

A surgically created arteriovenous fistula forms an @enlarged vein@ that serves as an access point for hemodialysis (which requires a vessel with high blood flow rates); however, if the fistula becomes too large, it can lead to hemodynamic complications. $A large arteriovenous fistula allows a high proportion of blood flow to bypass the resistance of the systemic arterioles, causing markedly #decreased systemic vascular resistance# (SVR) (ie, reduced afterload).

Most cardiac venous blood drains into the right atrium via the #coronary sinus#, with the remainder draining directly into the other chambers of the heart.  Three specific features distinguish cardiac circulation from blood flow to skeletal muscle and viscera:  $1. #The left ventricle is perfused only during diastole.#  Myocardial contraction during systole leads to compression of the coronary vessels and disruption of blood flow.  Wall tension is highest near the endocardium, making the subendocardial region the most prone to ischemia.  $2. #Myocardial oxygen extraction is very high.#  The heart has a capillary density far exceeding that of skeletal muscle.  Oxygen extraction from arterial blood is very effective within the heart as the resting myocardium extracts 60%-75% of oxygen from blood.  This amount is higher than that extracted by any other tissue or organ in the body.  As a result, the cardiac venous blood in the coronary sinus, before it reaches the right atrium and mixes with blood returning from the systemic circulation, is the most deoxygenated blood in the body #(choices A, C, D, and F)#.  $3. #Myocardial oxygen demand and coronary blood flow are tightly coupled.#  Because oxygen extraction by the resting heart is already very high, there is little capacity to increase myocardial oxygen extraction during periods of increased oxygen demand (eg, during exercise).  Therefore, increased oxygen delivery to the heart can be achieved only through increased #coronary blood flow#.  Adenosine and nitric oxide are the most important vasodilators responsible for increasing coronary flow. $#(Choice E)#  Deoxygenated systemic blood returning via the vena cava contains more oxygen than coronary sinus venous blood.  Because the pulmonary artery contains an admixture of blood returning via coronary sinus and systemic venous circulation, its oxygen content is also higher than pure coronary venous return. $#Educational objective# Myocardial oxygen extraction exceeds that of any other tissue or organ; therefore, the cardiac venous blood in the coronary sinus is the most deoxygenated blood in the body.

  "explanation_2": "Palpitations are a subjective sensation of the heartbeat usually caused by rapid arrhythmia or forceful ventricular contraction.  This patient with palpitations and an #irregularly irregular# pulse most likely has #atrial fibrillation#, the most common cause of an irregularly irregular rhythm. $In atrial fibrillation, the atria experience rapid and chaotic electrical activity, and organized atrial depolarization is lost.  In addition, because the rate of atrial electrical impulses is so high (eg, 500-600/min) and the atrioventricular node does not transmit impulses that quickly, impulses are transmitted to the ventricles randomly and intermittently.  Therefore, @ECG@ typically shows an #absence of P waves# and an irregularly irregular rhythm with #varying R-R intervals#; the ventricular rate is often (but not always) >100/min.  In addition, irregular, low-amplitude #fibrillatory waves# are sometimes present between the QRS complexes. $The development of atrial fibrillation is encouraged by #atrial remodeling#, which involves changes to atrial conduction pathways that occur as a result of aging and underlying chronic disease (eg, hypertension, heart failure).  Once a certain degree of remodeling is present, acute illness (eg, sepsis or other causes of increased sympathetic tone) and other conditions (eg, hyperthyroidism) can initiate foci of electrical activity that #trigger# the arrhythmia.  Excessive #alcohol consumption# is also a common trigger (ie, \"holiday heart syndrome\"). $#(Choice A)#  @Ventricular bigeminy@ involves a premature ventricular contraction after each normal sinus beat and is often triggered by periods of increased sympathetic tone.  Palpitations are common, but the rhythm is regularly irregular (ie, R-R interval varies in a predictable manner), with 2 beats occurring close together followed by a relatively long pause before the next beat. $#(Choice B)#  @Ventricular tachycardia@ demonstrates wide QRS complexes on ECG.  It may cause palpitations, but the rhythm is regular. $#(Choice C)#  @Atrial flutter@ demonstrates saw-toothed flutter waves on ECG and may cause palpitations.  Because atrial activity is slower (eg, 300/min) and somewhat more organized than in atrial fibrillation, the rhythm can be regular or irregular, depending on the steadiness of conduction through the atrioventricular node.  This ECG shows steady 2:1 conduction with a regular rhythm, which is not consistent with this patient's irregularly irregular pulse. $#(Choice E)#  @Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia@ commonly causes palpitations, but the rhythm is regular.  P waves are often not visible on ECG because they are buried within the QRS complexes. $#Educational objective# Atrial fibrillation is the most common cause of an irregularly irregular rhythm.  It often presents with palpitations and is confirmed by ECG showing an absence of organized P waves and irregularly irregular R-R intervals.  ",

There is also vasoconstriction of the splanchnic circulation and a higher degree of vasodilation in skeletal muscle, which shunts blood away from the gastrointestinal tract toward skeletal muscle and causes overall #reduced systemic vascular resistance# (SVR).

The left ventricle undergoes eccentric hypertrophy to increase left ventricular cavity size and improve diastolic filling capacity.  The resulting increase in end-diastolic volume capacity allows for increased stroke volume and cardiac output.  Because end-diastolic volume and stroke volume are both proportionally increased, left ventricular ejection fraction is mostly unchanged.  ",

The Frank-Starling effect states that as cardiac muscle is increasingly stretched, the cardiac output increases (up to a limit, as illustrated by the flat portion of the curve).  This is essentially the same length-tension relationship that is seen in skeletal muscle. $The venous return curve represents how venous return changes with variations in right atrial pressure.  Where the venous return curve intersects with the x-axis, it indicates a venous return of zero.  At this point, all circulatory flow ceases, and the pressure throughout the circulatory system equalizes.  This average pressure is termed the mean systemic filling pressure, which is a measure of the degree of filling of the circulatory system relative to the circulatory capacity.

  "explanation_2": "$In a patient with erythrocytosis, the following tests can help determine the cause: $1. #Absolute versus relative erythrocytosis#:  Hemoglobin and hematocrit levels cannot accurately differentiate these conditions.  Direct measurement of the RBC mass is necessary.  An increased total RBC mass indicates an absolute erythrocytosis; a normal RBC mass indicates a relative erythrocytosis.  This patient does not have an increased RBC mass and is likely experiencing relative erythrocytosis due to aggressive diuretic therapy for her heart failure exacerbation. $2. #Primary versus secondary erythrocytosis#:  Serum erythropoietin levels can be used to differentiate primary from secondary erythrocytosis.  Primary erythrocytosis is associated with low erythropoietin levels and is caused by myeloproliferative disorders such as polycythemia vera.  Secondary erythrocytosis is characterized by increased erythropoietin levels due to chronic hypoxia from high altitudes, smoking, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; or abnormal secretion by neoplastic or otherwise diseased tissues. $3. #Hypoxic versus other causes of secondary erythrocytosis#:  Measurement of the arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) is important to exclude hypoxemia as a cause of the erythrocytosis.  SaO2 < 92% (PaO2 < 65 mm Hg) can cause secondary polycythemia.  SaO2 (measured as a percentage) should not be confused with PaO2 (measured as a partial pressure in mm Hg). $#(Choice A)#  Polycythemia vera is a myeloproliferative disorder associated with marked erythrocytosis and more modest increases in granulocytes and platelets.  A low erythropoietin level is characteristic, along with increased RBC mass. $#(Choice B)#  Hypoxia is a common cause of secondary erythrocytosis.  SaO2 < 92% (PaO2 < 65 mm Hg) appears to be the threshold for the development of secondary erythrocytosis.  This patient has hypoxemia above this threshold, an acute (< 3 day) increase in hematocrit, and normal RBC mass; none of these features are consistent with hypoxemia-induced erythrocytosis. $#(Choices C and D)#  Occasionally, renal disease or occult neoplasia can cause secondary erythrocytosis due to abnormal erythropoietin production by the diseased tissue.  Work-up will reveal an increased RBC mass and an increased erythropoietin level.  However, chronic renal disease typically leads to decreased erythropoietin production. $#Educational objective# Erythrocytosis is defined as a hematocrit level > 52% in men and > 48% in women.

High iron levels and inflammatory conditions increase the synthesis of hepcidin, while hypoxia and increased erythropoiesis act to lower hepcidin levels.  Hepcidin influences body iron storage through its interaction with #ferroportin#, a transmembrane protein responsible for transferring intracellular iron to the circulation.  Upon binding hepcidin, ferroportin is internalized and degraded, decreasing intestinal iron absorption and inhibiting the release of iron by macrophages. $Regulation of intestinal iron absorption is crucial for maintaining iron homeostasis, since blood loss is the only way of removing large amounts of iron from the body.  Iron absorption from the proximal small intestine is facilitated by the divalent metal transporter-1 (DMT-1).  Once inside the intestinal cells, iron may take 1 of 2 paths:  $1. Iron may bind to ferritin (a primarily intracellular iron-binding protein) and remain stored within the enterocyte.  The stored iron is excreted in the stool as enterocytes slough off and are replaced  $2. Iron may enter the circulation through ferroportin, the basolateral iron transporter of the enterocyte.  Free iron released into the circulation is transported throughout the body by transferrin (an iron-binding transport protein), which becomes internalized after interacting with transferrin receptors present on all cells $#(Choices A and B)#  When senescent red blood cells are destroyed by macrophages, the iron is recycled by the reticuloendothelial system for use in new erythroid precursors.  Iron released by macrophages under the governance of hepcidin binds rapidly to transferrin and is delivered to the bone marrow, where erythroid precursors use it to synthesize hemoglobin.  This internal iron cycle conserves the body's iron very efficiently, and only small amounts of additional iron are required for daily red cell production in the absence of significant blood loss. $#(Choice D)#  Enterocytes store iron for excretion in the feces or transport it into the circulation depending on circulating levels of the polypeptide hormone hepcidin.  Lower hepcidin levels favor iron absorption and accumulation in the body. $#(Choice E)#  Renal tubular cells play a limited role in iron metabolism by secreting lactoferrin, which binds to free iron in the urine and possibly recovers it for metabolic use. $#Educational objective# Hepcidin is synthesized by the liver that acts as the central regulator of iron homeostasis.

For this reason, shorter catheters are preferred for rapid transfusion (eg, a large-bore peripheral [L = 2 cm] is preferred over a central venous catheter [L = 20 cm]). $#(Choice C)#  Doubling the pressure results in double the flow.  To achieve the equivalent flow of doubling the radius, the infusion pressure would need to be increased by a factor of 16.  Although it is possible to transfuse blood at high pressure, doing so risks hemolyzing the blood or blowing out the intravenous site. $#(Choice D)#  If the radius, length, and pressure are kept constant, placing a second identical catheter would result in double the flow.  To achieve the equivalent flow of doubling the radius, an additional 15 catheters would need to be inserted.  For this reason, a few low-resistance intravenous access sites (eg, 2 large-bore peripheral intravenous catheters) are preferable to many high-resistance sites. $#Educational objective# The most important determinant of intravenous infusion rate is the radius (diameter) of the intravenous catheter.  For patients requiring a rapid blood transfusion, the shortest possible catheter with the widest possible diameter (eg, a large-bore peripheral intravenous catheter) should be selected. "

  "explanation_2": "Patients with #chronic kidney disease# (CKD) often develop #normocytic anemia# as the glomerular filtration rate worsens due to #inadequate production of erythropoietin# (EPO), a glycoprotein hormone produced by peritubular fibroblast cells in the renal cortex.  EPO is released into the bloodstream in response to renal tissue hypoxia and subsequently acts on erythrocyte progenitor cells (erythroid colony–forming unit cells) in the bone marrow to reduce apoptosis and increase #differentiation# into mature red blood cells. $Although healthy individuals respond to anemia by increasing EPO levels up to 10,000-fold, patients with CKD have chronic inflammatory damage to renal EPO-producing cells and are often unable to generate sufficient levels of EPO to maintain adequate erythrocytosis.  These individuals are often treated with #synthetic forms of EPO# (eg, epoetin, darbepoetin) to supplement intrinsic EPO production and stimulate erythropoiesis.  Because synthetic forms of EPO can rapidly deplete iron stores (due to increased red blood cell production), patients should be tested for iron deficiency prior to treatment with these agents. $#(Choice A)#  Protoporphyrins (heme precursors) are elevated in patients with iron deficiency anemia.  Treatment of iron deficiency anemia (eg, iron supplementation) leads to the conversion of protoporphyrins to heme, thereby reducing free protoporphyrin levels.  Patients with iron deficiency anemia usually have low serum ferritin levels and transferrin saturation. $#(Choice B)#  Warm @autoimmune hemolytic anemia@ is characterized by antibodies against antigens on the red cell membrane that result in phagocytosis in the reticuloendothelial system (eg, spleen).  Autoimmune hemolytic anemia is usually treated with immune-suppressing agents (eg, prednisone), which blunt antibody production and reduce red cell destruction.  This patient with a normal bilirubin level is unlikely to have hemolytic anemia. $#(Choice D)#  Sickle cell anemia is caused by mutations in the beta globin chain, which results in the polymerization of deoxygenated hemoglobin molecules (\"sickling\").  Treatment with hydroxyurea induces expression of fetal hemoglobin (which is unaffected by the sickle mutation) over adult hemoglobin, thereby preventing polymerization of hemoglobin molecules. $#(Choice E)#  Deficiency of vitamin B12/folate (megaloblastic anemia) impairs nucleic acid metabolism, which results in slowed production of erythrocyte precursors in the bone marrow.  Replacement of vitamin B12/folate corrects the anemia by improving nuclear maturation.  Megaloblastic anemia is typically associated with macrocytic (elevated mean corpuscular volume) anemia. $#Educational objective# Erythropoietin (EPO) is produced by peritubular fibroblast cells in the renal cortex in response to decreased renal oxygen delivery.  EPO acts on erythrocyte precursors in the bone marrow to increase red blood cell production.  Patients with chronic kidney disease often have damage to renal EPO-producing cells, which results in normocytic anemia.  ",

If a neurologic deficit cannot be corrected, behavioral modifications can sometimes improve the safety of swallowing.  A #chin-tuck maneuver# (ie, flexion of the head and neck during swallowing) sometimes helps.  The maneuver seems to decrease the distance from the hyoid bone to the larynx (#simulating elevation of the larynx#), as well as to narrow the distance of the laryngeal entrance, leading to decreased aspiration. $#(Choice A)#  The first phase of swallowing is the oral preparatory phase, in which food is chewed and mixed with saliva to form a controlled bolus.  Although impaired mastication can lead to poor bolus formation, flexion of the head and neck does not generally change the mechanics of mastication. $#(Choice B)#  Elevation of the soft palate primarily prevents food from entering the nasopharynx rather than the larynx. $#(Choice C)#  Contraction of the base of tongue occurs during the pharyngeal phase of swallowing and pushes the bolus posteriorly into the pharynx.  Head and neck flexion could potentially worsen this function by increasing the distance that the base of tongue has to contract and by increasing the anterior force on the tongue due to gravity. $#(Choice E)#  Although adduction of the vocal folds is an important airway-protective mechanism, head and neck flexion would not alter vocal fold movement. $#Educational objective# The most important airway-protective movements during swallowing are the anterior/superior displacement of the larynx, the tilting of the epiglottis to block the airway, and vocal fold adduction.

Progesterone also prevents the release of motilin, a hormone responsible for stimulating the fasting migrating myoelectric complex, which normally helps propel undigested food from the small intestines into the colon.  Constipation may be exacerbated in later stages of pregnancy as the gravid uterus increases pressure on the small intestine, slowing intestinal transit. $Other common gastrointestinal alterations in pregnancy include reduced lower esophageal sphincter pressure (promoting gastroesophageal reflux) and gallbladder stasis (increasing the likelihood of developing gallstones).  Hemorrhoids are also common and result from a rise in pressure within the rectal venous system due to the gravid uterus. $#(Choice B)#  The parasympathetic nervous system stimulates peristalsis and gastrointestinal motility.  Reduced parasympathetic input to the colon can lead to constipation; however, this typically occurs with neurologic disorders (eg, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis). $#(Choice C)#  Defecatory dysfunction results from an inability to relax pelvic floor muscles, which prevents proper evacuation of stool from the rectal vault.  Although this can occur after trauma (eg, traumatic vaginal delivery), it is not a physiologic change that occurs during pregnancy. $#(Choice D)#  Thickened intestinal secretions can cause constipation; however, this is typically seen in patients with cystic fibrosis, which affects water and electrolyte transportation.  Patients with cystic fibrosis are typically diagnosed in infancy and have recurrent respiratory infections and failure to thrive. $#(Choice E)#  Rectoceles occur when the rectum herniates into the vaginal canal through a thinned rectovaginal septum.  Although they also cause constipation, rectoceles typically occur in elderly individuals with a history of multiple vaginal deliveries, not during pregnancy.  Patients often report needing to manually compress the vagina to induce bowel movements. $#Educational objective# Constipation is common during pregnancy and results from the inhibitory effect of progesterone on colonic smooth muscle contractions and the fasting migrating myoelectric complex.  Other common pregnancy-related changes of the gastrointestinal system include decreased lower esophageal sphincter pressure (leading to gastroesophageal reflux) and gallbladder stasis (leading to gallstone formation).

Ascites may occur in a variety of diseases (eg, peritoneal metastasis, congestive heart failure); however, in this patient with a history of heavy alcohol use and stigmata of chronic liver disease (eg, jaundice, spider angiomas, palmar erythema), it likely occurred from #cirrhosis#. $Cirrhosis is characterized by progressive liver fibrosis, which results in the formation of a high-resistance system (ie, #portal hypertension#).  This results in the following alterations:  $1. Nitric oxide is released, possibly due to stimulation by bacterial products (eg, endotoxin), which can more easily translocate from the gastrointestinal tract due to reduced host defenses (eg, impaired reticuloendothelial function) and portosystemic shunt formation (eg, decreased toxin clearance).  $2. Splanchnic vasodilation occurs as a result, which #decreases the splanchnic vascular resistance# and #lowers the effective arterial blood volume# (EABV) due to blood pooling in the splanchnic vascular bed.  $3.

Dietary proteins exist predominately as polypeptides; in order to be absorbed, they must be hydrolyzed to tripeptides, dipeptides, and amino acids.  Hydrolysis begins in the stomach with the activation of pepsin by hydrochloric acid; it continues in the proximal small intestine, catalyzed by the pancreatic enzymes trypsin, chymotrypsin, carboxypeptidase, and elastase. $Pancreatic enzymes, including trypsin, are secreted in their inactive forms.  #Enteropeptidase#, a duodenal brush border enzyme, is responsible for #activation of trypsin# from its inactive precursor, trypsinogen.  Once active, trypsin functions to cleave peptide bonds in dietary proteins and activate the other pancreatic enzymes.  Enteropeptidase #deficiency# leads to both #protein and fat malabsorption# as trypsin is required to activate enzymes required for both lipid and protein digestion.  The disease causes #diarrhea, failure to thrive, and edema# (due to hypoproteinemia). $#(Choice A)#  Amylase is produced by the salivary glands and pancreas; it catalyzes the hydrolysis of complex carbohydrates to simple sugars. $#(Choice B)#  Bile salts are formed through bile acid conjugation with amino acids glycine and taurine.  This increases their solubility, allowing them to aid in lipid digestion and absorption through the formation of micelles. $#(Choice C)#  Lactase is produced by the intestinal brush border and is responsible for the hydrolysis of lactose to glucose and galactose.  Lactase non-persistence commonly develops during mid-childhood, resulting in lactose intolerance. $#(Choice D)#  Chief cells of the stomach release the inactive form of pepsin, pepsinogen.  Exposure to hydrochloric acid in the stomach activates pepsin, initiating protein digestion. $#(Choice E)#  Secretin is a peptide hormone secreted by the S cells of the duodenum; it stimulates the secretion of bicarbonate from the pancreas and inhibits gastric acid secretion in the stomach.  Neutralization of the acidic pH of food entering the duodenum from the stomach is necessary for the proper function of pancreatic enzymes. $#Educational objective# The duodenal brush border enzyme enteropeptidase activates trypsin from its inactive precursor, trypsinogen.  Trypsin degrades complex polypeptides to dipeptides, tripeptides, and amino acids while activating other pancreatic enzymes.

  "explanation_2": "Classically, the stimulation of acid secretion within the stomach is separated into three phases: cephalic, gastric, and intestinal.  The cephalic phase is mediated primarily by cholinergic and vagal mechanisms, and is triggered by the thought, sight, smell, and taste of food.  The gastric phase is mediated by the presence of gastrin (which stimulates histamine secretion and therefore, indirectly, acid secretion), and is triggered by the chemical stimulus of food and distension of the stomach.  The intestinal phase is initiated when protein-containing food enters the duodenum, but this phase plays only a minor role in stimulating gastric acid secretion. $In fact, intestinal influences are effective in down-regulating gastric acid secretion after a meal.  The ileum and colon release peptide YY, which binds to receptors on the endocrine, histamine-containing cells described as enterochromaffin-like (ECLs).  Such binding counteracts the cephalic and gastric phases of acid secretion by inhibiting gastrin-stimulated histamine release from ECLs.  Other factors that inhibit acid secretion include somatostatin and prostaglandins. $#(Choice A)#  Basal gastric secretion has been defined as the gastric juices secreted in the absence of intentional or avoidable stimuli (essentially, the \"baseline\" gastric acid secretion).  Basal gastric secretion is not an important factor in the down-regulation of postprandial gastric secretion. $#(Choices B and C)#  The cephalic and gastric phases both stimulate gastric acid secretion, not down-regulate it. $#(Choice E)#  Receptive relaxation is a reflex that allows the gastric fundus to dilate in anticipation of food passing through the pharynx and esophagus.  It is not an important factor in the down-regulation of postprandial gastric secretion. $#(Choice F)#  Postprandial alkaline tide is defined as an increase in plasma HCO3‾ and decrease in plasma Cl‾ secondary to the surge of acid within the gastric lumen.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient's recurrent epigastric pain after eating fat- and protein-rich meals strongly suggests #biliary colic# from underlying gallstones and/or biliary sludge.  Most commonly, gallstones are cholesterol based, often developing in persons older than age 40.  Elevated estrogen exposure (eg, female sex, obesity, pregnancy) significantly increases the risk because it stimulates cholesterol-rich bile secretion. $When bile becomes supersaturated with cholesterol, microscopic crystal formation creates a thick slurry (biliary sludge), with further aggregation producing gallstones.  On detecting fat- and protein-rich chyme, I cells lining the duodenum and jejunum release the hormone #cholecystokinin# (CCK), causing the #gallbladder to contract#.  This contraction may force gallstones and sludge against the gallbladder outlet; the resulting occlusion increases intragallbladder pressure, leading to pain that is typically felt in the #right subcostal or epigastric# region.  As CCK levels wane, the gallstones and sludge fall back, relieving pressure (ie, a postprandial waxing-waning pain pattern). $In addition to stimulating gallbladder contraction, CCK also increases pancreatic enzyme secretion and relaxes the sphincter of Oddi, thereby orchestrating fatty and amino acid absorption. $#(Choice B)#  Patients with lactose intolerance often have postprandial abdominal pain after ingesting dairy products.  However, the pain usually occurs with bloating and diarrhea, symptoms not present in this patient. $#(Choice C)#  Prostaglandins (eg, PGE2, PGI2) help protect the gastric mucosa from damage by acid; in contrast, excess consumption of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can inhibit production of gastroprotective prostaglandins, increasing the risk for gastric ulcers that may cause postprandial epigastric pain. $#(Choice D)#  Secretin is a hormone that stimulates the pancreas to secrete bicarbonate, helping to regulate pH in the duodenum.  Although it also increases bicarbonate secretion by the biliary tract, it does not induce gallbladder contraction. $#(Choice E)#  Carcinoid tumors can secrete high amounts of serotonin, causing flushing, diarrhea, and bronchospasm.  They most commonly present with periodic abdominal pain, which arises from mesenteric fibrosis or bowel kinking/obstruction rather than increased serotonin. $#(Choice F)#  Somatostatin suppresses gastrointestinal hormone release (eg, insulin, CCK, vasoactive intestinal peptide), reduces intestinal motility, and decreases splanchnic blood flow. $#Educational objective# The release of cholecystokinin (CCK) from the duodenum and jejunum after exposure to fat- and protein-rich meals stimulates gallbladder contraction.  In patients with gallstones or biliary sludge, contraction can force the stones/sludge against the gallbladder outlet, causing temporary occlusion of outflow and increased intragallbladder pressure. This manifests as postprandial upper abdominal pain that waxes and wanes with CCK levels (biliary colic).  "

However, infants are generally shielded from direct sunlight due to sunburn risk.  In addition, infants with dark skin pigmentation require more sunlight exposure to produce adequate vitamin D.  Melanin is a natural sunblock and prevents ultraviolet rays from reaching the skin for vitamin D synthesis.  Prolonged vitamin D insufficiency can lead to rickets (inadequate bone and cartilage mineralization).  Therefore, all #exclusively breastfed# infants should receive #vitamin D supplementation# to #prevent rickets#.  Formula-fed infants do not require supplementation as formula is fortified with adequate amounts of vitamin D. $#(Choices A, C, and D)#  Human breast milk normally provides adequate amounts of folic acid, riboflavin, and thiamine for full-term infants. $#(Choice B)#  Although breast milk has low iron content, the bioavailability of iron in breastmilk is considerably higher than supplemental iron and is sufficient for infants until age 4 months.  Due to decreasing iron concentration in breast milk over time, supplementation is recommended for breastfed infants at age >4 months until solid food intake provides an adequate amount. $#(Choice E)#  Vitamin A stores in the liver are low at birth but rapidly increase due to the large amount in colostrum and breast milk. $#Educational objective# The breast milk content of vitamins D and K is typically insufficient for the nutritional needs of the newborn.  Vitamin K is given parenterally to all newborns at birth to prevent hemorrhagic disease of the newborn.  Exclusively breastfed infants require vitamin D supplementation due to lack of sunlight exposure and to prevent rickets.  ",

The thick filaments in skeletal muscle are comprised of myosin molecules, with the heads of the myosin molecules forming cross-links with actin during muscular contraction.  Two actin chains comprise the thin filaments in skeletal muscle.  Tropomyosin molecules sit in the groove between the two actin chains, covering the myosin binding sites on actin when the muscle is at rest.  Troponin molecules are small globular proteins situated alongside the tropomyosin molecules.  Troponin is composed of three subunits: troponin T, troponin I, and troponin C.  Troponin T binds the other troponin components to tropomyosin, troponin I binds the troponin-tropomyosin complex to actin, and troponin C contains the binding sites for Ca2+.  During excitation-contraction coupling, Ca2+ is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.  When Ca2+ binds troponin C, tropomyosin shifts to expose the actin binding sites for myosin, allowing contraction to occur. $#(Choice A)#  Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter that initiates muscle contraction in response to motor neuron stimulation.  Acetylcholine release from the motor neuron opens post-synaptic ligand-gated ion channels, resulting in depolarization of the muscle cell.  Depolarization then causes release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. $#(Choice B)#  Epinephrine is a catecholamine that is not directly involved in skeletal muscle contraction.  However, epinephrine stimulates β2-adrenergic receptors to increase skeletal muscle blood flow, glycogenolysis, and lipolysis. $#(Choices C and D)#  Calmodulin and myosin light-chain kinase are elements of the contractile mechanism in smooth muscle, not skeletal muscle. $#Educational objective# The contractile mechanism in skeletal muscle depends on proteins (myosin II, actin, tropomyosin, and troponin) as well as calcium ions.

Finally, #25-hydroxyvitamin D# is filtered by renal glomeruli (with vitamin D-binding protein) and delivered to proximal tubule cells, where 1-alpha-hydroxylase converts it to #1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D#, the physiologically active form.  The activity of 1-alpha-hydroxylase is upregulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH) and inhibited by fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a peptide secreted by osteocytes in response to high levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. $#Chronic kidney disease# (CKD) results in impaired conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D due to the following factors: $• FGF23 levels increase early in CKD, causing direct inhibition of 1-alpha-hydroxylase $• Reduced glomerular filtration limits the delivery of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to proximal tubule cells $• Reduced functional renal mass limits production of 1-alpha-hydroxylase $Inadequate production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D causes reduced intestinal absorption of calcium.

  "explanation_2": "$On exposure to #sunlight#, #7-dehydrocholesterol# (provitamin D3) in the skin absorbs ultraviolet (UV) B rays.  This opens the B ring of 7-dehydrocholesterol, forming previtamin D3, which then undergoes thermal isomerization to form #vitamin D3# (cholecalciferol).  Vitamin D3 is then hydroxylated in the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D and subsequently to 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D (the active form) in the kidneys. $Vitamin D deficiency can lead to osteomalacia with bone pain or tenderness, muscle weakness or cramps, gait abnormalities, and increased fracture risk.  Factors associated with limited UV exposure and increased risk of vitamin D deficiency include the following: $• #Reduced time outdoors:#  elderly individuals, patients living in residential care or who are frequently hospitalized, people who avoid going outdoors due to high risk of skin cancer $• #Low UV sun exposure:#  individuals living at extreme northern or southern latitudes $• #Predominantly nocturnal lifestyle:#  shift work or occupations requiring overnight work $• #Blockade of sunlight exposure:#  people who use high-grade sunblock or wear full-coverage clothing $• #Reduced UV penetration:#  individuals with heavily pigmented skin $#(Choices B and C)#  The conversion of vitamin D2 and D3 to 25-hydroxycholecalciferol by 25-hydroxylase in the liver is primarily regulated by feedback inhibition from 25-hydroxycholecalciferol.  The conversion to 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol by 1-alpha-hydroxylase in the kidney is primarily regulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH) and plasma calcium levels.  Neither of these steps takes place in the skin or is affected by sunlight exposure. $#(Choices D and E)#  25-hydroxyvitamin D-24-hydroxylase converts 25- and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D into inactive 24-hydroxylated metabolites.  It is upregulated by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (to prevent excess vitamin D activity) and suppressed by parathyroid hormone (to facilitate replenishment of circulating calcium levels) and thus functions as a counter-regulatory homeostatic enzyme.  However, it is not affected by sunlight. $#Educational objective# Sunlight exposure catalyzes conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) in the skin.  Subsequent 25-hydroxylation in the liver and 1-hydroxylation in the kidneys produce 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, the active form.  Inadequate exposure to sunlight can lead to vitamin D deficiency.  "

  "explanation_2": "$The Golgi tendon organs (GTOs) are sensory receptors located at the junction of the muscle and tendon that are innervated by group Ib sensory axons.  GTOs are connected in series with the contracting extrafusal skeletal muscle fibers.  When a muscle actively contracts against resistance, the increase in tension is transmitted through the tendon activating the GTOs in the process.  In contrast, GTOs are relatively insensitive to changes in muscle length because the lengthening that occurs when a muscle is passively stretched takes place primarily in the muscle fibers and not in the tendon. $The Ib sensory axons from the GTOs contact inhibitory interneurons in the spinal cord, which in turn synapse with the α motor neurons that innervate the same muscle.  Thus, the Golgi tendon circuit is a negative feedback system that regulates and maintains muscle tension.  When a muscle exerts too much force, the GTOs inhibit contraction of the muscle, causing sudden muscle relaxation.  This prevents damage to the musculoskeletal system. $#(Choice A)#  A-delta fibers are thin, myelinated nerve fibers whose free nerve endings detect temperature and nociceptive stimuli.  They are associated with acute (sharp) pain and constitute the afferent portion of the reflex arc that mediates withdrawal from noxious stimuli (e.g., retracting the hand away from a hot stove). $#(Choice C)#  In contrast to the in-series arrangement of GTOs, muscle spindles (intrafusal muscle fibers) are connected in parallel with extrafusal fibers.  They are innervated by group Ia and group II sensory axons and are sensitive to changes in muscle length.  Muscle spindles mediate the stretch reflex (myotatic reflex), which is commonly tested (deep tendon reflexes) during the neurologic examination.  When a muscle is stretched, there is monosynaptic reflex activation of the α motor neuron (of the same muscle), causing contraction that resists the stretch. $#(Choices D and E)#  Pacinian corpuscles are rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors located in the subcutaneous tissue of the skin as well as the mesentery, peritoneum, and joint capsules.  Ruffini’s end organs are slowly adapting mechanoreceptors that exist in the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and joint capsule.  Both help to mediate touch, proprioception, and vibratory sensation and are innervated by myelinated A-beta fibers. $#Educational objective# The muscle spindle system is a feedback system that monitors and maintains muscle length, while the Golgi tendon system is a feedback system that monitors and maintains muscle force.  GTOs are exquisitely sensitive to increases in muscle tension but are relatively insensitive to passive stretch.  "

The initial abnormality in Paget's disease is excessive osteoclastic bone resorption followed by increased bone formation by osteoblasts; this results in #high bone turnover# in the affected areas.  The new bone formation is disorganized, and pagetic bone lesions typically appear on imaging as thickened areas of mixed sclerosis and lucency. $Osteoblasts are cells with a single nucleus that arise from mesenchymal stem cells found in the periosteum and bone marrow.  In contrast, #osteoclasts# originate from the mononuclear phagocytic cell lineage and are ultimately formed when several precursor cells fuse to create a #multinucleated# mature cell.  Osteoclasts in Paget's disease are typically very large and can have up to 100 nuclei (normal osteoclasts have 2-5).  The 2 most important factors for osteoclastic differentiation, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (#M-CSF#) and receptor for activated nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (#RANK-L#), are produced by osteoblasts and bone marrow stromal cells. $Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a physiologic decoy receptor that decreases binding of RANK-L to RANK.  Inhibition of RANK-L to RANK receptor interaction reduces the differentiation and survival of osteoclasts, resulting in decreased bone resorption and increased bone density #(choice C).#  OPG loss-of-function mutations cause juvenile Paget's disease.  A monoclonal antibody (denosumab) that inhibits the RANK/RANK-L interaction also leads to increased bone density and is commonly used for the treatment of osteoporosis. $#(Choice A)#  Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) regulate chondrogenesis and osteogenesis.  FGFs induce proliferation of osteoblastic precursor cells and anabolic function of mature osteoblasts.  Abnormalities in the FGF receptor result in the congenital short-limbed dwarfism known as achondroplasia. $#(Choice B)#  Insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I and IGF-II) are synthesized by various tissues, including the liver and bone.  IGF-I increases osteoblastic replication and collagen synthesis; it also decreases collagen degradation by inhibiting the enzyme matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13).  The net effect of IGF-I on the bone is anabolic. $#(Choice E)#  Transforming growth factor beta increases the replication of osteoblast precursors, leading to increased formation of mature osteoblasts.  Transforming growth factor beta also increases collagen synthesis and decreases bone resorption by increasing osteoclastic apoptosis. $#Educational objective# Osteoclasts originate from hematopoietic progenitor cells.  Macrophage colony-stimulating factor and receptor for activated nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANK-L) play an important role in osteoclast differentiation.  Paget's disease of bone is characterized by increased numbers of abnormal osteoclasts, excessive bone turnover and disorganized bone remodeling.  ",

Because different muscles (with different sources of innervation) control inspiration and expiration, respiratory function is differentially impaired based on the level of spinal cord injury. $#Inspiration# is driven by an increase in intrathoracic volume.  This is mediated predominantly by contraction of the #diaphragm#, which is innervated by the #phrenic nerve# that originates from the #C3-C5# nerve rootlets.  Accessory muscles of inspiration elevate the sternum and ribs to further expand the thoracic cavity.  These include the external intercostals (innervated by thoracic nerve roots), the sternocleidomastoid (innervated by C1-C4), and the scalenes (innervated by C4-C8). $Passive expiration is driven by the net intrinsic elastic recoil of the lungs, chest wall, ribs, and diaphragm and therefore requires no innervation.  #Active expiration#, as measured in this patient's pulmonary function testing, recruits the musculature to pull the ribs down and compress the abdominal contents to push the diaphragm up and decrease intrathoracic volume.  This is driven by the #internal intercostals# (innervated by #thoracic nerve roots#) and #abdominal muscles# (innervated by #thoracic and lumbar nerve roots#). $Because the spinal cord injury was at the #level of C7# in this patient, the diaphragm and many of the accessory inspiratory muscles are likely functional, resulting in minimal impairment of maximal inspiratory pressure.

  "explanation_2": "$The brain has little room for expansion as it is encased in the cranium.  A small volume change in any of the intracranial components (eg, brain tissue, blood, cerebrospinal fluid [CSF]) can produce significant changes in intracranial pressure (ICP).  Therefore, even small increases in cerebral blood volume can raise ICP and cause brain compression. $The main factors influencing cerebral circulation are systemic blood pressure and arterial blood gas levels.  When systemic blood pressure is 60-140 mm Hg, it has little effect on cerebral blood volume because autoregulation (via cerebral blood vessel dilation and contraction) keeps blood flow constant.  Blood pressure >150 mm Hg increases cerebral vascular volume and blood flow, causing a corresponding increase in ICP.  In contrast, blood pressure <50 mm Hg causes cerebral hypoperfusion and potential ischemia. $Arterial blood gases also have a powerful effect on cerebral blood flow, with PaCO2 being the most important regulator.  A #drop in PaCO2# due to hyperventilation causes #vasoconstriction#.  The resulting reduction in cerebral blood volume #(choice C)# leads to decreased ICP.  Lowering PaCO2 is one of the measures employed to #reduce ICP# in mechanically ventilated patients with cerebral edema. $#(Choice A)#  The brain has a very large oxygen requirement, about 20% of all O2 consumed by the body.  Induced sedation and therapeutic hypothermia can decrease brain metabolic demand, exerting a neuroprotective effect and improving ICP by reducing cerebral blood volume. $#(Choice B)#  The vasoconstriction induced by hyperventilation can cause a decrease in local cerebral perfusion that can worsen neurologic injury in patients with acute traumatic brain injury or stroke.  Therefore, hyperventilation should be used with caution in these patients, and the PaCO2 should be maintained ≥ 30 mm Hg. $#(Choice E)#  The thecal sac is a sheath of dura mater that contains CSF and surrounds the spinal cord.  Increased ICP can cause displacement of CSF from the brain into the thecal sac.  However, the drop in ICP caused by hyperventilation reduces CSF displacement. $#Educational objective# Carbon dioxide is a potent vasodilator of cerebral vasculature.  Tachypnea causes hypocapnia and cerebral vasoconstriction, thereby decreasing cerebral blood volume and intracranial pressure.  "

This process, known as #long-term potentiation (LTP)#, dictates synaptic strength between hippocampal neurons and plays a critical role in the molecular basis of memory, learning, and addiction. $Because of its role in memory, acute blockade of glutamate NMDA receptors confers the amnestic property of certain medications (eg, ketamine) and some drugs of illicit use (eg, phencyclidine [PCP]).

Myelin is an electrical insulator and increases the conduction velocity of action potentials; demyelination leads to slowing of the impulses with resultant neurological deficits. $The speed of conduction down an axon depends on 2 constants: the length constant and the time constant (ie, #velocity = length/time#). $• The @length constant@, also known as the space constant, is a measure of how far along an axon an electrical impulse can propagate without requiring active regeneration by ion channels.  It is based on the relative resistance of conduction along the axon (within the cytoplasm) compared to the resistance across the membrane.  Myelin increases the length constant by reducing charge dissipation across the membrane (increasing membrane resistance).  This allows the electrical impulse from individual sodium channels to travel farther, allowing activation of more distant channels.  As such, demyelination will decrease the length constant and result in shorter impulse conduction. $• The @time constant@ is a measure of the time it takes for the membrane potential to respond to a change in membrane permeability (ie, sodium channel activation) and is based on membrane resistance and capacitance.  Myelin decreases membrane capacitance (reduces the amount of charge stored by the membrane) and increases membrane resistance (reduces charge leakage through the membrane) in axon segments between the nodes of Ranvier; this reduces the time constant and allows the membrane potential to change faster.  Demyelination would increase the time constant and result in slower changes in membrane voltage. $Therefore, #demyelination# decreases neuronal signaling velocity both by #decreasing the length constant# and increasing the time constant (ie, ↓ velocity = ↓ length / ↑ time) #(choice E).# $#(Choices B and C)#  @Summation@ refers to the additive effects of multiple postsynaptic potentials on a target neuron's membrane potential.

While at the resting potential, the inner side of the membrane is negatively charged with respect to the outer surface of the membrane.  $2. #Depolarization:#  Occurs due to opening of voltage-gated Na⁺ channels with rapid influx of Na⁺ into the cell.  The large influx of Na⁺ leads to an increased positive charge inside the membrane known as depolarization #(choice B).#  Overshoot refers to the maximal value of the action potential during which the membrane potential obtains a positive value (approximately +35 mV) #(choice C).#  $3. #Repolarization (choice D):#  Results from closure of Na⁺ channels and simultaneous opening of K⁺ channels.  This causes a sharp decrease in the membrane permeability to Na⁺ and a significant increase in K⁺ permeance that exceeds that of the resting membrane.  K⁺ efflux is responsible for returning the membrane potential back to the resting potential.  $4. #Hyperpolarization (choice E):#  Occurs because the voltage-gated K⁺ channels remain open for a short time after repolarization is completed.  The membrane potential thus becomes more negative than the normal resting potential and approaches the K⁺ equilibrium potential of -85 mV.  When the voltage-gated K⁺ channels close, the membrane potential returns to the resting value maintained by the non-gated K⁺ channels. $#Educational objective# The action potential results from changes in the membrane permeability to K⁺ and Na⁺ ions.  Depolarization results from massive influx of Na⁺ through voltage-gated Na⁺ channels.  Repolarization occurs due to closure of voltage-gated Na⁺ channels and opening of voltage-gated K⁺ channels.  K⁺ ion permeance is highest during the repolarization phase of the action potential.  ",

These adaptations include: $• #Increased plasma volume#, which begins at approximately 6 weeks gestation and increases rapidly until term, resulting in a total plasma volume increase of 30%-50% when compared to a nonpregnant state.  Increased plasma volume helps reduce positional hypotension caused by uterine compression of the vena cava (ie, decreased venous return when patient is supine or standing) and ensures adequate circulating volume for fetal nutrient delivery and waste removal. $• #Increased maternal red blood cell mass#.  Pregnant women generate higher levels of erythropoietin, which drives the production of new red blood cells and increases red blood cell mass by 20%-30%.  This increase helps ensure adequate oxygen delivery to the fetus and placenta; it also #protects against excessive blood loss# associated with delivery (eg, postpartum hemorrhage). $Because the expansion of maternal blood plasma volume is greater than the increase in maternal red blood cell mass, pregnant women typically have a #mild reduction in hemoglobin concentration# due to dilution. $#Educational objective# Pregnant patients have marked increases in blood plasma volume (by 30%-50%) and red blood cell mass (by 20%-30%), which helps improve fetal nutrient delivery while also protecting against excessive blood loss during delivery.

These patients are particularly sensitive to the decrease in venous return occurring in the supine or right lateral decubitus position, a condition known as #supine hypotension syndrome# (or aortocaval compression syndrome). $A significant drop in blood pressure can develop and/or heart rate can increase when patients with supine hypotension syndrome are placed in the supine position; corresponding symptoms include pallor, sweating, nausea, and light-headedness.

  "explanation_2": "$Reproductive-age women have monthly menstrual cycles (ovulation and bleeding) due to cyclic hormonal changes in the @hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis@ (HPO axis).  FSH and LH are gonadotropins released by the anterior pituitary.  FSH stimulates maturation of a dominant ovarian follicle, which produces estrogen.  During the late follicular phase (ie, midcycle), the increasing estrogen levels cause the hypothalamus to release GnRH in a specific pulsatile pattern that triggers the LH surge.  The LH surge then induces follicular rupture and oocyte release (ie, ovulation). $This patient with coarse chin hair likely has anovulatory infertility related to polycystic ovary syndrome.  Patients with anovulatory infertility often undergo #ovulation induction# therapy with exogenous gonadotropins (ie, FSH) to stimulate ovarian follicular development #(choice B).#  Once the follicles appear mature on ultrasound, patients receive an #injection of hCG#.  The hormones hCG, LH, FSH, and TSH share a common alpha subunit; in addition, the beta subunit of hCG is also structurally similar to the beta subunit of LH.  Due to this beta subunit similarity, hCG can bind to and activate the same receptors as LH.  Therefore, the hCG injection #mimics the LH surge# and acts as the #ovulation trigger#. $#(Choice A)#  Estrogen, produced by the dominant ovarian follicle, physiologically increases and peaks in the late follicular phase.  This change leads to the LH surge, follicular rupture, and ovulation.  Estrogen levels decrease with rupture of the dominant follicle. $#(Choice D)#  After ovulation, the remnants of the dominant follicle form the corpus luteum, which secretes progesterone.  Progesterone induces endometrial decidualization in preparation for pregnancy implantation.  An implanted pregnancy will secrete hCG as a signal to the ovary to maintain the corpus luteum until the placenta can take over progesterone production.  If no pregnancy implants, the corpus luteum regresses and progesterone decreases. $#(Choice E)#  Testosterone is produced in the adrenal glands and ovarian theca cells.  Testosterone production within theca cells increases slightly during the late follicular phase in response to the LH surge. $#Educational objective# Anovulatory infertility can be treated with ovulation induction therapy, which may include a course of gonadotropins to stimulate the ovarian follicles.

Progesterone is secreted during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and transforms the endometrium from proliferative to secretory to promote pregnancy implantation.  Endometrial glands become more elaborate, and the spiral arteries, which supply the stratum functionalis, elongate and coil.  Exogenous progesterone intake for 10 days similarly matures the endometrium. $When the endometrium is no longer exposed to progesterone (ie, #progesterone withdrawal#), local prostaglandin production increases.  This causes uterine contractions (eg, cramping), leading to #compression/constriction of the spiral arteries#.  In response to decreased blood supply, the cells in the stratum functionalis undergo programmed cell death, or #apoptosis#.  Progesterone withdrawal also causes endometrial stromal cells to secrete metalloproteases, causing degradation of the extracellular matrix.  The net effect is degeneration of the stratum functionalis, which sloughs away as #menstrual blood flow#.  The stratum basalis remains intact (as it is supplied by the straight, not spiral, arteries), allowing for regeneration of the stratum functionalis during the next proliferative phase. $#(Choice B)#  Dysplasia is the abnormal growth of cells, tissues, or organs.

Intrauterine procedures or infection can result in proliferation of granulation tissue with subsequent endometrial scarring and formation of fibrous adhesions (ie, @Asherman syndrome@). $#(Choice D)#  Hyperplasia is increased cell number due to increased cell proliferation.  Endometrial hyperplasia can cause abnormal (eg, intermenstrual, prolonged) uterine bleeding if the overly proliferative, thickened endometrium outgrows its blood supply.  However, the immediate cause of bleeding in this patient is cellular apoptosis triggered by withdrawal of progesterone. $#(Choice E)#  Hypertrophy is the enlargement of tissue due to increased cell size without increased cell proliferation.  Patients with @adenomyosis@ have hypertrophy of the surrounding uterine smooth muscle cells, which results in a uniformly enlarged, globular uterus. $#(Choice F)#  Invagination (inward folding) of epithelial cells occurs during embryonic development (gastrulation) to form structures such as the @neural tube@.

This minimizes the volume of the cavernous tissue (sponge-like regions of erectile tissue) and limits blood flow into the vascular channels of the penis. $• Erect state: Increased parasympathetic stimulation leads to a rise in nitric oxide and cyclic GMP production, causing @smooth muscle relaxation@.  The resulting increase in penile blood flow fills the relaxed sinusoids, engorging the corpora cavernosa.  Subsequent compression of the venous sinuses reduces venous outflow and helps maintain the erection. $Priapism most often occurs due to ongoing obstruction of the venous sinuses (low-flow priapism); the resulting #impaired penile venous outflow# prevents normal detumescence.  Patients with SCD are at elevated risk due to increased sensitivity to vasodilators such as adenosine (released by ischemic tissue) that maintain corpora cavernosa engorgement.  Persistent venous obstruction eventually results in #penile ischemia# (similar to compartment syndrome); blood gas analysis will show #hypoxia, hypercarbia, and acidosis#.  Priapism is a medical emergency because events lasting more than 12 hours can result in #permanent erectile dysfunction#. $#(Choice A)#  Fibrosis of the tunica albuginea occurs in Peyronie disease.  The excessive fibrous scar tissue often causes painful erections and abnormal penile curvature.  Persistent erection does not occur in this condition. $#(Choices C and E)#  Parasympathetic activity stimulates erection, whereas sympathetic activity promotes detumescence.  Impaired parasympathetic activity and/or increased sympathetic activity would result in a flaccid penis, not priapism. $#(Choice D)#  Rarely, a pathologic increase in penile arterial inflow (eg, trauma, atrioventricular fistula) can cause high-flow (nonischemic) priapism characterized by aspiration of bright red blood with normal pH, oxygen, and carbon dioxide levels.  However, this patient's penial blood gas analysis is indicative of low-flow (ischemic) priapism, which occurs far more frequently than high-flow priapism (particularly in patients with SCD). $#Educational objective# Engorgement of the corpora cavernosa during erection compresses the venous sinuses, which reduces penile venous outflow to help maintain an erection.  Priapism most often occurs due to persistent obstruction of the venous sinuses that prevents normal detumescence.  Blood aspiration from the corpora cavernosa reveals penile ischemia due to the low-flow state.  ",

  "explanation_2": "This patient is most likely suffering from #acute mountain sickness (AMS)#, a type of #high-altitude illness# resulting from low partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) in environments >2,500 m (8,000 ft).  Although the fraction of oxygen in inspired air remains constant (21%) at different terrestrial elevations, barometric pressure drops with increasing altitude, leading to decreased pO2 in the air and lungs. $In an otherwise healthy patient, the pO2 rapidly equilibrates between the alveoli and arterial blood, causing #hypoxemia# when the pO2 drops below 80 mm Hg.  Several acute physiological changes occur in response to the resulting #hypobaric hypoxia#: $• Increased firing of @peripheral chemoreceptors@ causes hyperventilation, which directly reduces hypoxemia and improves tissue oxygenation #(choice A).# $• #Increased 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) #synthesis by erythrocytes, which shifts the @O2-hemoglobin dissociation curve@ to the right, decreasing the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen and facilitating the offloading of oxygen in peripheral tissues. $Hyperventilation also decreases the partial pressure of carbon dioxide, resulting in increased blood pH (#respiratory alkalosis#).  Common symptoms of AMS include headache, fatigue, dyspnea, dizziness, and sleep disturbances.  Most cases subside within 2 days but can progress to life-threatening cerebral and/or pulmonary edema in susceptible patients.  In the absence of underlying pathology, symptoms typically resolve within 48 hours as the kidneys #increase HCO3− excretion# to compensate for the alkalosis, restoring pH toward the normal range and improving symptoms #(choice E).# $#(Choice B)#  Hypoxia induces widespread vasoconstriction of the pulmonary vasculature; this increases pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary arterial pressure and can result in pulmonary edema. $#(Choice C)#  Hypoxemia stimulates increased erythropoietin production in the renal cortex, which results in polycythemia and increased oxygen-carrying capacity over time (days to weeks of sustained hypoxemia). $#Educational objective# People traveling to elevations >2500 m (8000 ft) can develop high-altitude illness, characterized by hypobaric hypoxia with the potential to develop life-threatening cerebral and/or pulmonary edema.  Key adaptive responses to hypoxemia include hyperventilation to increase blood oxygenation and increased synthesis of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate in erythrocytes (facilitating oxygen offloading into peripheral tissues).

  "explanation_2": "$The body maintains its core temperature in a tightly controlled process known as #thermoregulation#.  In a normal state, body temperature is maintained between 36.5-37.5 C (97.7-99.5 F) via #anterior hypothalamic control#.  Afferent signals (from central and peripheral thermal receptors) are interpreted by the hypothalamus, which promotes temperature homeostasis through alterations in the autonomic nervous system as well as the thyroid and adrenal axes. $#Hypothermia#, defined as a core body temperature <35 C, occurs when the body loses more heat than it generates.  It most commonly occurs due to cold exposure but may also occur due to endocrine disorders (eg, hypothyroidism), skin disorders (eg, burns), abnormal autonomic function (eg, peripheral neuropathies, stroke, spinal cord injury), or drugs that promote vasodilation (eg, alcohol) or impair sympathetic response (eg, beta blockers). $The following physiologic adaptations occur in patients with hypothermia: $• #Increased sympathetic activity# (catecholamine release): promotes #peripheral vasoconstriction# and results in shunting of blood away from the skin.  It also #increases muscle tone# and brown fat metabolism #(choices A and C)#. $• #Shivering:# rapid involuntary muscle contractions that increase muscle metabolism, generating heat as a byproduct. $• #Increased thyroid function:# prolonged cold exposure leads to increased production of thyroid hormone, which increases basal metabolic rate. $These actions promote normalization of body temperature by reducing heat loss and #increasing metabolic rate# (heat generation) #(choice B).# $#(Choice D)#  The sympathetic, not the parasympathetic nervous system, is responsible for the physiologic adaptations in hypothermia.

Physiologic adaptations in response to hypothermia include increased sympathetic activity and thyroid hormone release, shivering, and peripheral vasoconstriction.

  "explanation_2": "Muscarine, a toxin found in certain mushrooms, acts as a #muscarinic (M) agonist# in place of acetylcholine, resulting in an #increase in parasympathetic nervous system activity#.  The M2 and M3 subtype receptors are responsible for most of the toxicities seen in patients. $Although the walls of peripheral blood vessels lack cholinergic innervation, M3 receptors are present on the #endothelial# surface.  Activation of M3 receptors promotes #synthesis of nitric oxide# (NO), an endothelium-derived relaxing factor.  NO diffuses into @vascular smooth muscle cells@, activating guanylate cyclase and increasing intracellular cyclic-GMP.  Increased levels of cyclic-GMP activate #myosin light chain phosphatase#, which dephosphorylates myosin and prevents interaction of the myosin head with actin, resulting in #smooth muscle relaxation# and #vasodilation#.  Vasodilation results in hypotension, with persistently low blood pressure leading to somnolence due to inadequate cerebral perfusion. $In contrast, activation of M3 receptors in other sites leads to a G-protein-coupled increase in intracellular calcium, resulting in smooth muscle contraction.

This combination results in decreased inotropy (less contractility) and chronotropy (decreased heart rate). $#(Choice C)#  Juxtaglomerular cells in the kidney release renin in response to decreased renal perfusion pressure.  A muscarinic agonist would not have a direct effect on renin release, although the peripheral vasodilation and bradycardia might indirectly lead to renin release. $#Educational objective# Activation of muscarinic receptors by acetylcholine or cholinergic agonists results in peripheral vasodilation due to synthesis of nitric oxide in endothelial cells, which leads to vascular smooth muscle relaxation (eg, hypotension).

  "explanation_2": "$The improvement in this patient's mild myopia is likely due to @age-related changes@.  Normally, in #accommodation#, when focusing on near objects (eg, reading), ciliary muscle contraction relaxes the zonular fibers, allowing the lens to become more convex so the image focuses #on the retina#. $Starting around age 40-50, almost all individuals develop an inability to focus on near objects.  In this condition, called @presbyopia@, progressive denaturation of lens proteins and changes in lens curvature cause the lens to become less elastic and lose its accommodating power.  In most patients, this causes the image of near objects to focus #behind the retina# resulting in difficulty reading fine print and the need to hold objects farther away in order to see them clearly.  However, in patients with mild #myopia# (increased axial length with an image focused #in front of the retina#), presbyopia can #compensate# for myopia by displacing the image backward, so that it focuses on the retina.  These patients often note improvement in visual acuity with age as presbyopia develops. $#Skin rhytides #(@wrinkles@) are also directly caused by chronological aging (with a contribution from the harmful effects of ultraviolet light).  With aging, skin becomes atrophic and fragile, with reduced elasticity and subdermal fat.  There is dermal and epidermal thinning, flattening of the dermoepidermal junction, a decreased number of fibroblasts, and reduced synthesis and increased breakdown of collagen and elastin. $#(Choices A, B, and C)#  Although age is a risk factor for actinic keratoses, angle-closure glaucoma, and atherosclerosis, age-related changes themselves do not cause these conditions.  Actinic keratoses (ie, premalignant lesions increasing squamous cell carcinoma risk) are rough, scaly, erythematous papules on sun-exposed areas that result from ultraviolet damage.  Angle-closure glaucoma occurs due to impaired aqueous humor flow.  Atherosclerosis is primarily attributable to hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and genetic (familial) predisposition. $#(Choice D)#  Femoral head osteonecrosis is associated with vasculitis (lupus), corticosteroid therapy, sickle cell disease, and alcohol use disorder.  It is not an age-related condition and can occur in children (eg, Legg-Calve-Perthes disease). $#Educational objective# Presbyopia and skin wrinkles are age-related changes.  Presbyopia occurs due to denaturation of structural proteins within the lens, leading to loss of lens elasticity which can result in improved vision in patients with mild myopia.  Decreased synthesis and increased breakdown of collagen and elastin contribute to the development of skin wrinkles.  ",
