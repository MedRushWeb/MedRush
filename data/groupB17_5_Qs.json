Some patients benefit from opioid replacement therapy, either indefinitely or as a bridge to gradual cessation.  #Buprenorphine# is a semisynthetic opioid used to replace and treat dependency on unregulated opioids (eg, heroin) due to its favorable pharmacokinetics. $As a #partial agonist# at the mu opioid receptor (ie, mixed agonist and antagonist activity), buprenorphine has a #ceiling effect#.  At higher doses, the agonist activity is equally opposed by the antagonist activity, leading to a plateau (ceiling) in the dose-response curve.

Therefore, high doses of buprenorphine carry a #lower risk of respiratory depression# compared to full agonists such as heroin #(choice C).# $A key drawback of partial agonists (eg, buprenorphine) is the potential to #displace full agonists# from the receptor: partial agonists act as relative antagonists in the presence of full agonists.  Therefore, buprenorphine can #precipitate acute withdrawal# if administered when receptors are still occupied by full agonists (eg, heroin).  For this reason, patients must discontinue opioids and partially enter the withdrawal state (eg, wait 48 hours) prior to the initiation of buprenorphine. $#(Choice A)#  Complete reversal of a full agonist (eg, heroin) requires a full antagonist (eg, naloxone).  Because buprenorphine is a partial agonist-antagonist, the degree of reversal is limited by the ceiling effect. $#(Choice D)#  The ability of antagonists to displace bound drugs is determined by the affinity of the drug-receptor interaction.  Drugs that bind tightly have a steep binding curve; in other words, a lower concentration of drug is required to achieve the same effect.  Buprenorphine has a higher affinity to the mu receptor than heroin, which is apparent from its steeper binding curve.  Overdose with buprenorphine often requires repeated, high doses of naloxone due to this higher affinity. $#Educational objective# Buprenorphine is a semisynthetic opioid with mixed/partial agonist-antagonist activity, resulting in a therapeutic ceiling.

Neuropathologic features often overlap with other neurodegenerative conditions and may include: $ •  #Aggregations of phosphorylated tau protein:#  Tau is a protein associated with neuronal microtubules, and it normally takes part in microtubule stabilization.  In patients with FTD, tau becomes hyperphosphorylated and disassociates from the microtubules, which may lead to instability and disrupted axonal transport.  Phosphorylated tau aggregates to form inclusions that can appear as @neurofibrillary tangles@ (similar to those seen in Alzheimer disease) or round inclusions (ie, Pick bodies). $ • #Abnormal TDP-43 protein inclusions:#  TDP-43 is a protein involved in DNA repair and transcription, and it becomes abnormally ubiquitinated in FTD.  Pathologic TDP-43 is also found in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. $ (Choice B)  Cytoplasm inclusions with alpha synuclein are characteristic of dementia with Lewy bodies, which is characterized by visual hallucinations, parkinsonism, cognitive fluctuations, and REM sleep behavior disorder. $ (Choice C)  Cytosolic vacuolation of neurons and glia with prion inclusions are seen in patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a prion disease.  Although behavioral changes are common, dementia is rapidly progressive and associated with myoclonus and/or seizures. $ #(Choices D and E)#  Presenilin is a component of the gamma-secretase complex, which is involved in cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP).  Abnormal cleavage of APP leads to increased beta amyloid deposition that is commonly seen in patients with Alzheimer dementia.  Alzheimer dementia commonly presents with early and prominent memory impairment with language deficits and spatial disorientation.  Although personality changes can occur, they typically present later in the disease process. $ Educational objective Frontotemporal dementia presents with early personality change, executive dysfunction, compulsivity, and hyperorality.  Neuropathologic findings include neurofibrillary tangles due to abnormal tau proteins (also seen in Alzheimer dementia) and pathologically ubiquitinated TDP-43 (also seen in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis).","clickable_1":"images/img1.15443.jpg","clickable_2":"images/img2.15443.jpg"},

{"id":"15641","title":"A 44-year-old man comes to the office due to fatigue for the past 6 months.  He says, \"I've fallen asleep at work a few times, and I really have to push myself to concentrate.  I can't seem to get a good night's sleep either because I keep waking up.\"  The patient feels guilty that he has been spending less time with his kids due to feeling tired and states his mood has been low the past week.  He worries that his wife is annoyed with him because he has not been helping with household chores as much and keeps her up at night due to his snoring.  The patient drinks 3 or 4 beers a week and does not use tobacco or illicit drugs.  Medical history is noncontributory.  Blood pressure is 146/94 mm Hg and pulse is 78/min and regular.

The patient's bed partner should be asked about snoring, as well as breathing pauses and nocturnal gasping or choking.

His sleep disturbance, fatigue, and impaired concentration began prior to his mood changes and are better explained by untreated OSA. $ (Choice B)  Narcolepsy may also cause excessive daytime sleepiness.
