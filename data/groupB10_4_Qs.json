It is monomorphic, existing only in mold form (ie, multicellular hyphae). $Aspergillus causes the following conditions: $â¢ #Invasive aspergillosis# develops in #immunosuppressed patients#.  The prolonged neutropenia associated with leukemia and lymphoma treatment is a strong risk factor.  It most commonly affects the lung and can cause fever, pleuritic chest pain, and hemoptysis.

Visualization of #pseudohyphae#, a chain of budding yeasts joined together with end-to-end at constrictions, is an important diagnostic clue.  C albicans is distinguished from other Candida species by its ability to form #germ tubes# (true hyphae with no constrictions) when incubated at 37 C (98.6 F) for 2-3 hours (ie, germ tube test). $C albicans is a human commensal organism that may cause mucocutaneous infection in otherwise healthy individuals but rarely causes invasive disease.  Protection against infection is mediated by the following: $â¢ Intact epithelium:  Candida triggers toll-like receptors on epithelial cells to release proinflammatory cytokines, which recruit immune cells to the area; epithelial cells also release beta-defensins, which provide antifungal activity. $â¢ Resident macrophages/monocytes:  Penetration of epithelial cells by fungal hyphae causes resident macrophages to release inflammatory cytokines that recruit lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils to the area of infection.  #T helper lymphocytes# specific for Candida antigens help drive the epithelial and macrophage response, and are important for prevention of #superficial Candida infection# (eg, oral/esophageal, cutaneous, vulvovaginitis). $â¢ #Neutrophils:#  Neutrophils are the most important immune cell in the protection against #invasive Candida# (eg, candidemia, deep tissue infections).  Neutrophils kill Candida by releasing reactive oxygen species, lactoferrin, lysozyme, elastase, and beta-defensins.  They are also the only immune cell that is able to prevent germination of Candida yeasts into penetrating hyphae. $Patients who undergo cytotoxic chemotherapy and develop #neutropenia# are at dramatically increased risk for invasive infection.  Indwelling central intravascular catheters are also a major risk factor for invasive disease. $#(Choice A)#  Early complement proteins (eg, C3b, C5b) assist opsonization, and late complement proteins (C5-C9) form the membrane attack complex.  Complement is crucial for control of bacterial infections, but it plays a minimal role in the control of Candida.  In addition, complement levels are not particularly diminished by chemotherapy. $#(Choice B)#  Candida is primarily controlled by neutrophils, macrophages, and helper T cells; immunoglobulins have more of an adjunctive role.  In addition, immunoglobulin levels are not typically affected by most cytotoxic chemotherapy because memory B cells are long lasting and have low rates of cellular division. $#(Choice C)#  Although chemotherapy impairs the production of granulocytes, which include eosinophils, basophils, and neutrophils, transient reduction in eosinophil and basophil count does not drastically increase risk of infection. $#(Choice E)#  T lymphocytes (particularly Th1 and Th17 subtypes) primarily prevent superficial Candida infection by strengthening the mucosal immune defense; conditions that impair cell-mediated immunity (eg, HIV) are associated with higher risk of mucocutaneous Candida infection (eg, thrush, esophagitis).  However, protection against invasive disease is mediated primarily by neutrophils, not lymphocytes. $#Educational objective# Neutrophils are the most important immune cell in the defense against invasive Candida infection; therefore, patients with neutropenia (eg, following cytotoxic chemotherapy) are at high risk for invasive disease (eg, candidemia, meningitis).  In contrast, T lymphocytes are more important for prevention of superficial, mucocutaneous infection (eg, thrush).  "},

These are common and are seen most frequently during initial infusions (often diminish with subsequent infusions).  Premedication with antipyretics and antihistamines can lessen the severity of these effects. $â¢ #Dose-dependent nephrotoxicity# can result from a drug-induced decrease in the glomerular filtration rate.
