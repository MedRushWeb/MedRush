This involves reflecting the patient's view that alcohol helps him relax and then encouraging discussion of any downsides to drinking from his perspective.  In this way, the patient is encouraged to identify ambivalent feelings about drinking that can help him begin to make his own arguments for change. $ (Choice A)  This statement focuses on the negative aspects of alcohol use and insists that it be addressed, which may lead to defensiveness rather than change.  Instead, the patient's resistance should be respected, and his internal motivation encouraged. $(Choice B)  Although this response initially acknowledges the patient's perspective, it then makes an assumption that may be experienced as judgmental.  It would be better to encourage an open-ended discussion about how the patient himself understands his alcohol use. $ (Choice D)  This approach prematurely focuses on alternative behaviors  without first developing the patient's ambivalence about drinking and intrinsic motivation to make a change.  The patient should be encouraged to come up with possible alternative behaviors himself rather than forcing suggestions on him. $(Choice E)  Although this statement accurately reflects the patient's current lack of readiness to make a change, it does not encourage discussion and prematurely terminates any efforts to facilitate change. $Educational objective Motivational interviewing is a patient-centered approach to help change maladaptive behaviors; it matches strategies to the patient's stage of readiness to make a change.

If a face-to-face interpreter is unavailable, alternate modes of communication include computer-assisted real-time transcription and assistive listening devices. $(Choice A)  Friends and family members are not preferred for interpretation due to lack of impartiality, unfamiliarity with medical terminology, and possible barriers to open discussion of sensitive topics (eg, domestic abuse).

Medication use is one of the most #modifiable# risk factors for falls. $ #Psychotropic drugs#, including antipsychotics such as aripiprazole; antidepressants, such as sertraline and amitriptyline; and benzodiazepines are most commonly associated with increased fall risk.  #Cardiovascular drugs# that reduce circulating blood volume or blood pressure such as calcium channel blockers (eg, amlodipine), beta blockers, and diuretics are also associated with falls.  The patient should undergo a #medication review# with the goal of finding the lowest effective dose, eliminating unnecessary medications, and/or switching to those associated with a lower fall risk. $ #(Choices A and D)#  Bed rails and soft physical restraints have not been shown to reduce falls in long-term care facilities.  Some studies indicate a slightly increased risk of falls and injury in nursing home patients who are physically restrained. $ #(Choices B and E)#  Assistive devices such as canes and walkers are often used to improve mobility in patients with gait or balance disturbances.  However, there is a lack of evidence regarding their efficacy in preventing falls (they may impair compensatory stepping reactions that help with balance recovery). $ Educational objective Falls are a common problem in elderly nursing home patients.  Optimal management includes a careful medication review with the goal of limiting the use of agents associated with increased fall risk."

Physicians should attempt to put patients of all sexual orientations and gender identities at ease when reviewing #sexual history# because, for some, the discussion may feel uncomfortable and intrusive.  Normalizing the discussion as a routine component of the medical examination, ensuring confidentiality, remaining nonjudgmental, and expressing a willingness to address all sexual health concerns can facilitate the discussion. $ When asking about sexual partners, the physician should #avoid# using labels or making #assumptions# about patients or their partners' sexual orientation or gender identity.  Asking an #open-ended# question about #all sexual partners# allows patients to describe their sexual partners and behavior in terms that they are familiar with and that reflect their gender identity.  After inquiring about the gender of sexual partners (including trans, nonbinary), the physician can ask about pertinent types of sex (eg, vaginal, oral, anal) with each partner in order to make testing recommendations for sexually transmitted infections (eg, HIV) and discuss risk-reduction strategies.  Another possible formulation is, 'What is/are the sex and gender of your sexual partner(s)?' $ (Choice B)  This question is nonspecific and does not directly address sexual behavior.  An individual may be sexually active outside of a romantic relationship or may not view an interaction as romantic.  Although this question may yield some information regarding the patient's relationship history, it may exclude important information about some partners and sexual behaviors. $ (Choice C)  Questioning the patient about other sexual partners while he was married may make him feel judged and less willing to disclose his sexual history.  This inquiry also fails to focus on all sexual partners. $ (Choice D)  This question forces the patient to choose a sexual orientation label.  Many individuals may identify as heterosexual but have sexual contact with individuals of the same gender.  Others may not relate to any of these labels to describe their sexuality. $ (Choice E)  Asking the patient whether he has ever had intercourse with a man is a narrow, close-ended question that does not address the possible range of his sexual behaviors or partners. $ Educational objective Taking a sexual history is a key part of comprehensive care and requires an inclusive and nonjudgmental approach.

    "explanation_2": "Nearly 20% of the United States population speaks languages other than English at home.  It is therefore essential that physicians assess language proficiency when delivering care to immigrant populations.  This patient's immigrant background and difficulty describing her pain should raise concern about limited English proficiency (LEP) and the need for a qualified medical interpreter.  In the United States, patients with LEP experience a variety of health care disparities, including reduced clinical encounter time, substandard medical treatment, and higher rates of adverse events and preventable medical errors.  The safety of LEP patients is particularly jeopardized in high-risk clinical situations such as emergency department care, surgical care, hospital discharge, and medical reconciliation. $ A useful screening technique to assess language proficiency is to ask the patient, \"How well do you speak English: Not at all, not well, well, or very well?\"  An interpreter is appropriate for patients who cannot respond or respond \"not well.\"  Recommended interventions to prevent adverse events include providing a qualified medical interpreter in high-risk clinical situations and providing translated educational materials.  Using the \"teach back\" method (in which patients are asked to \"teach\" the physician what was just explained to them) can also serve to confirm understanding. $ #(Choices A, B, and C)#  Understanding cultural and social factors and sensitivity in obtaining a sexual history are important components of patient-centered care.  However, addressing a potential language barrier takes precedence. $ (Choice D)  Contacting the patient's family is unlikely to be productive and may violate patient confidentiality. $ Educational objective Physicians must be able to identify patients with limited English proficiency and ensure that professional interpreters are made available in high-risk clinical situations."

It is a flexible, patient-centered process (ie, #prioritizes patient values#) that delineates key patient preferences that can then guide medical decision-making.  The process may include (but does not necessitate) creation of legal documents, such as appointment of a surrogate decision maker who acts on the patient's behalf if the patient is #incapacitated#.  ACP often begins with an informal conversation with the patient (and trusted family members, if appropriate) to explore the patient's beliefs about illness, death, and health care interventions. $ The ACP process is meant to promote patient empowerment by ensuring that patients receive care aligned with their expressed values.  However, patient participation in ACP remains low (<11% of patients) and occurs even less frequently among patients who belong to ethnic minorities (eg, Hispanic, Black, Asian).  Ethnic #disparities in ACP initiation# and completion may result from #distrust# of health care systems, cultural norms, misconceptions, and suboptimal physician communication. $ This patient's statement indicates that she has a misconception about ACP—that she must \"sign away\" her life with legally binding documents.  It also indicates that she values ownership over her health care decisions—a value that is in fact supported by ACP.  Therefore, the physician should respond by #explaining the ACP shared goal# of patient empowerment (eg, of allowing her preferences to be shared) in simple, nonjudgmental terms.  Expressing this patient-centered goal can #increase trust#, acceptability, and likelihood of patient engagement in subsequent discussions. $ (Choice A)  Given the patient's low probability of 12-month survival, realistic conversations about end-of-life care are important.  However, this statement does not clarify the purpose of ACP and focuses on the physician's opinion more than the patient's expressed values. $ (Choice B)  The patient has not expressed fear, so this statement is less likely to engage her and may appear condescending.  Moreover, the statement does not offer clarity on the purpose and benefits of ACP. $ (Choice C)  This statement alludes to only one potential outcome of ACP: participation of family members in patient care (eg, as surrogate decision makers).  The primary purpose of ACP is to identify and honor the patient's wishes;  it is premature to assume that the patient values or prefers family involvement. $ (Choice E)  If the patient continues to decline engagement, her wishes should be respected.  However, the physician should first clarify potential misconceptions about ACP (eg, \"sign away my life\") and attempt to find common ground by highlighting the shared, patient-centered goal of ACP. $ Educational objective Advance care planning (ACP) is the process of identifying a patient's health care goals in case of serious illness.  Patient participation in ACP is low, especially among ethnic minorities due to factors such as mistrust or suboptimal physician communication.

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act #(HIPAA)# is designed to #protect patient privacy#.  This #requires# the patient's explicit consent (or lack of objection when given the opportunity) #to share medical information# with others, including family and friends. $ When the patient is #incapacitated# or is not present, #basic information can be shared# if, in the physician's professional judgment, doing so is in the patient's #best interest#.  In this case, there is no way of knowing for sure whether informing this woman (whether she is his wife or not) is in the patient's best interest.  However, the woman is distressed, and leaving her to worry for an extended period while the patient is recovering could cause the patient emotional harm if she is indeed family.  The best approach to protect the patient's privacy is to explain that he is stable, but that further information (including general diagnostic and treatment information) cannot be shared until he is asked for and provides consent. $ (Choice A)  This discussion would violate the patient's privacy. $ #(Choices B and D)#  This patient has not given permission to release information to the presumed wife, even if she provides identification or marital status is confirmed.  For instance, the patient could be undergoing a contentious divorce and not want any information released to his wife.  HIPAA does not require proof of identity if the patient has given permission to share information. $ (Choice C)  Providing minimal information that the patient is \"stable\" would be appropriate.  This response protects the patient's privacy by not revealing the diagnosis or other medical details, but also limits emotional harm to the patient by informing those who are likely to be family about the patient's condition.  If permission to share information is obtained later, the physician should ask the patient whether he prefers that potentially sensitive details be omitted (eg, if the myocardial infarction was due to cocaine use and the patient did not want this revealed). $ Educational objective Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, physicians may disclose patient information to friends and family members in emergency situations or when the patient is otherwise incapacitated, depending on what is in the best interest of the patient.  Otherwise, patient information may be disclosed only when the patient gives explicit permission or does not object when given a reasonable opportunity."

Comfort measures should be provided as appropriate, and staff should avoid disrupting the family's final moments with the patient. $ (Choice B)  As next of kin, the patient's wife has the authority to make decisions for the patient.  Nothing in this case suggests inadequate or insincere decision-making by the wife, and her decisions should be respected. $ (Choice C)  According to the patient's wishes, he should not receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation measures.  However, nonresuscitative supportive care (eg, supplemental oxygen) and comfort measures (eg, pain medication) should continue as usual and not be withheld. $ (Choice D)  Court proceedings are time-consuming and disruptive.  They are generally necessary only when a suitable surrogate cannot be identified or when there are intractable disagreements among surrogates (eg, multiple adult children). $ (Choice E)  Treatment of ventricular fibrillation with antiarrhythmic medications is considered part of the ACLS resuscitation algorithm and is generally excluded as part of a do-not-resuscitate order.  In general, partial algorithm implementation should not be considered in the absence of specific guidance from the patient or surrogate. $ Educational objective When a patient is unable to communicate his or her wishes regarding care and does not have an advance directive or designated surrogate decision-maker, decision-making falls to the next of kin (eg, spouse).  The next of kin is generally determined by the proximity of relationship and is responsible for making decisions based on what they believe the patient would want and the patient's best interest.",

Although the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education has mandated limitations on resident work hours in response to patient safety concerns, extended work hours of attending physicians are unregulated.  Physicians typically do a poor job of self-regulating their workload, often underestimate their cumulative sleep debt, and minimize its impact on their clinical skills.

Provider conscience does not take precedence over other #ethical principles# (eg, autonomy, justice, beneficence, nonmaleficence). $ As with any procedure or treatment, the physician should have a neutral discussion regarding the procedure and alternatives.  The physician should be nonjudgmental, refrain from imposing moral values, and convey #respect# for the #patient's autonomy#.  If the patient decides to undergo the procedure after neutral education, she should be provided with resources that will assist in obtaining the desired service.  Providers who are unable to provide care in good conscience are professionally and ethically #obligated to refer# patients in a timely fashion to other providers who can provide care. $ #(Choices A and D)#  The physician is not required to perform the procedure but is obligated to provide resources to help the patient find another provider who will perform it in a timely manner to respect the patient's autonomy. $ (Choice B)  Encouraging the patient to reconsider her decision is inappropriate because it imposes the physician's own judgment and values.  Discussing age-related infertility risks in this situation can inadvertently place guilt or shame on the patient and should be avoided. $ (Choice C)  Encouraging the patient to take additional time to make a decision is not advisable because this could place her past the first trimester and increase complexity/risk to the procedure. $ Educational objective Conscientious refusal of treatment occurs when a provider refuses to provide care due to moral conflict.

In this case, the medication error could be due to an unclear decimal point or a transcription error.  Although the increased use of computerized physician order entry systems with drop-down menus for drug, dose, route, and frequency has reduced the incidence of these errors, the systems are not universally available.

Studies show that educational interventions to reduce the use of certain abbreviations (eg, QD, μg) and avoid trailing zeros lead to a significant decrease in transcription errors. $ (Choice A)  Confirming the dosage with the patient may be helpful.  However, it is an inadequate double-check due to many patients being unaware of their medication dosage or in a mental state (due to a psychiatric or medical condition) that may prevent them from thinking clearly about it. $ (Choice C)  Because a particular medication may be available in different dosages, computerized checks with automated alerts may not consistently identify a higher dosage as an error.  Computerized systems are helpful in eliminating illegible orders; identifying patients at high risk for an adverse event; and alerting physicians to medication allergies, drug interactions, and dosage limits. $ (Choice D)  Eliminating trailing zeros entirely is a better option than reminding physicians to be careful placing decimal points. $ (Choices E and F)  Hiring additional nursing and pharmacy staff to perform double-checks on each medication order would not be cost-effective and would not consistently detect handwritten notation errors, as individuals reviewing the orders may influence each other's opinion. $ Educational objective Avoiding the use of unsafe abbreviations and trailing zeros in medication orders can help reduce the incidence of medication errors."

Uncomplicated LBP usually resolves spontaneously, and management is directed toward providing temporary symptomatic relief.  Imaging (eg, x-ray, MRI scan) is generally not recommended because it does not improve outcomes or provide necessary information for optimal management. $#Overutilization# refers to provision of #unnecessary services# that are not expected to improve #patient outcomes# or meaningfully change #management#.  Patient–centered health care requires care to be delivered with respect to the patients' concerns, preferences, and priorities, but does not require unnecessary testing or treatment if patient input is otherwise solicited and respected when appropriate.  MRI in uncomplicated LBP increases overutilization and is therefore not recommended for this patient. $ (Choice A)  Spinal MRI often identifies nonspecific abnormalities (eg, bulging intervertebral discs) that are not relevant to management but can lead to further unnecessary and potentially harmful diagnostic studies and interventions.  Because of the frequency of such abnormalities, even in asymptomatic individuals, it is often not clear whether they are the actual cause of pain or merely an incidental finding.  Deferring imaging therefore decreases, rather than increases, diagnostic uncertainty. $ (Choice B)  Fragmentation of health care refers to breaking up care across multiple providers and facilities without adequate cross communication.  Declining to order unnecessary tests does not lead to fragmentation. $(Choice C)  Health care disparity refers to differences in access to care or outcomes due to socioeconomic or demographic factors.  Careful and appropriate use of diagnostic studies does not increase disparity. $ (Choice D)  Malpractice liability risk correlates most closely with provider-patient communication and perceived level of concern.  Appropriate use of diagnostic studies, especially as it conforms to evidence-based guidelines, does not increase malpractice risk. $ (Choice E)  Clinical standardization refers to consistency of management decisions within and across provider groups.  Care that conforms to established guidelines increases, not decreases, standardization. $ Educational objective Overutilization refers to provision of services that are not expected to improve patient outcomes or meaningfully change management.

Initially, partners may be angry about the pregnancy but can later become supportive and exhibit gentler behavior.

This is also an opportunity to review the risks (eg, increased neonatal mortality, lack of access to emergency medical interventions) and benefits (eg, higher vaginal delivery rate, fewer obstetric interventions) of home birth.  Patients determined to proceed with a home birth require counseling on the indications for transfer to a hospital (eg, abnormal fetal heart rate, arrest of labor). $ (Choice A)  Although home births are associated with increased neonatal mortality, stating that home birth is risky (ie, \"I don't think we should consider this option\") does not allow the patient to express her concerns and is paternalistic. $ (Choice B)  Safe home births require more than a good support system (eg, partner, family, doula).

In addition, this statement shifts responsibility for this patient's care to another (nonmedical) provider, which is inappropriate. $ (Choice D)  This patient's prior vaginal delivery and absence of chronic medical conditions are favorable for home birth.  However, the caveat \"as long as your pregnancy remains uncomplicated\" may set the patient up for disappointment if obstetric complications arise.  In addition, it may discourage her from disclosing symptoms (eg, vaginal bleeding, persistent headache) of serious obstetric complications. $ (Choice E)  Delaying the conversation about home birth dismisses the patient's concerns, which will likely harm the physician-patient relationship.  Exploring her reasons for wanting a planned home birth is a more patient-centered approach. $ Educational objective Desiring a planned home birth may reflect low satisfaction or negative experiences with a prior in-hospital delivery.  Therefore, providers should assess what, if any, aspects of the prior in-hospital delivery were concerning to the patient."

Asking the patient why she remains in the relationship implies that she should have left; it is also likely to be perceived as judgmental and might discourage her from seeking help in the future. $ (Choice E)  Asking the patient if she understands why the physician is concerned is condescending and judgmental.  It is a closed-ended question that would likely discourage the patient from discussing her own feelings and fears. $ Educational objective Patients experiencing intimate partner violence should be approached in a supportive, nonjudgmental, open-ended manner.

      "explanation_2": "An arrangement in which a payor (individual, employer, or government entity) pays a #fixed, predetermined fee# per patient to cover all required medical services is termed capitation.  #Capitation# is the payment structure underlying #health maintenance organization# (HMO) provider networks.  Under capitation, there is an incentive for the provider and patient to reduce expenses, usually by restricting patients to a limited panel of providers within the plan, requiring referrals from a primary care provider prior to specialist consultations, and denying payment for services that do not meet established evidence-based guidelines. $ Capitation payments are often made to a private insurance company, which then negotiates with individual physicians or physician networks to provide care.  Alternately, a very large physician group (including primary and specialty physicians) may contract directly with employers to provide capitated care for their employees. $ (Choice B)  Discounted fee-for-service is a payment arrangement in which an insurer pays a provider for each individual service provided at a pre-arranged, discounted rate.  Employers would not generally negotiate a fee-for-service contract directly with a provider. $ (Choice C)  Global payment is an arrangement in which an insurer pays a provider a single payment to cover all the expenses associated with an incident of care.  This is most commonly done for elective surgeries, in which the global payment covers the surgery as well as any pre- and post-operative visits needed. $ (Choice D)  A patient-centered medical home is a specific model of primary care in which patients have access to a personal physician who coordinates care and sees the patient through all aspects of care, including preventive services and acute and chronic disease management.  Payment for these services may be capitated or fee-for-service. $ (Choice E)  Point-of-service plans require patients to have a primary care provider and obtain referrals for specialty consultations.  They differ from HMO plans in that they allow patients to see providers outside the network, albeit at higher out-of-pocket costs (copays and deductibles). $Educational objective Capitation is an arrangement in which a payor pays a fixed, predetermined fee to provide all the services required by a patient.  Payors may negotiate a capitated contract with an insurance company that then pays the providers, or a large medical group may negotiate directly with the payor."

For example, Black and Hispanic patients are more likely to be undertreated for pain compared to nonminority patients.

Exploration of the patient's emotional state is better achieved through an open-ended discussion of the values important to his comfort and well-being. $ (Choice C)  This statement is physician centered; it focuses on the physician's perception of the patient's comfort.

In addition, the physician cannot violate confidentiality by sharing results with the patient's son without her permission. $ (Choice D)  Although the statement expresses empathy, it does not give the son a chance to explain why he opposes disclosing the diagnosis.  Premature dismissal of his concerns risks the loss of valuable information (eg, safety concerns). $ (Choice E)  This approach assumes that the son's intention is to avoid distressing his mother.  However, the underlying reason may be something else (eg, cultural norms, the patient's own wishes).  The physician should keep an open mind to the son's concerns and not presume to know the patient's feelings without speaking to her first. $ Educational objective Autonomy, which supports a patient's right to know his or her diagnosis, is a fundamental ethical principle.  However, limiting disclosure of a diagnosis may be appropriate under certain circumstances (eg, patient preference, imminent safety concerns).  An understanding, open approach is necessary to uncover these circumstances."

Once the psychosocial aspects of treatment are addressed, weight loss counseling is likely to be more fruitful. $ (Choice C)  This patient's frustrations pertain to diabetes and insulin.  Once that issue is addressed, if the patient has additional concerns or depressive symptoms in other domains, a more detailed depression assessment could be performed. $ (Choice D)  This response conveys empathy but diverts attention from the patient to the provider.  Such a statement might be appropriate as a cheerful end to the conversation but is not an effective way to initiate further discussion. $ (Choice E)  This patient's feelings of guilt may be related to his family background, but his concerns focus specifically on his lifestyle habits and diabetic control rather than genetic factors in the etiology of diabetes. $ Educational objective Failure of oral medications is common in long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus due to progressive loss of pancreatic beta cell function.  Patients should be counseled that because of the natural history of the condition, the need for supplemental insulin is common and does not represent a personal failure."

However, she previously outlined her wishes in the form of an #advance directive# that specified \"no intubation.\"  An advance directive is prepared when the person has #decision-making capacity# and is used only when the person #lacks the capacity# to make a medical decision at the time of service. $ There are two main types of advance directive: $ • A #living will# is a written document detailing the patient's wishes primarily regarding specific end-of-life interventions (eg, intubation, enteral feeding). $ • A #health care proxy# is designation of a surrogate decision maker who is authorized to make health care decisions on the patient's behalf. $ If no advance directive is in place, decision-making falls to a default surrogate (eg, @next of kin@).  Because the default surrogate may have conflicting emotions and opinions regarding end-of-life decision-making, an advance directive, especially a living will, prevents confusion by establishing the patient's preferences for future medical care.  Based on the principle of #patient autonomy#, an advance directive is determinative in making decisions regarding a patient's care. $ In this scenario, the \"no intubation\" directive overrules any family member's preference, and the physician may not intervene against this patient's advance directive.  However, this message must be delivered with sensitivity given the nature of the patient's condition and its impact on loved ones.  #Clear but gentle communication# on following the patient's instructions (eg, \"we should follow and respect her wishes\") should be #provided within a supportive context# (eg, \"we're doing everything possible\") to ease distress. $ #(Choices A and B)#  Relating to the loved one's distress with empathy can provide comfort and support.  However, the ensuing blunt comments (eg, \"regaining consciousness is minimal,\" \"would be inappropriate\") are unnecessarily harsh. $ #(Choices C and D)#  Without a living will, a health care proxy or default surrogate decision maker (eg, spouse, adult child) may determine medical care.  However, in almost all states, living wills take precedence in decision-making, and the husband should not be misled by suggestion that the patient's predetermined decision (ie, \"no intubation\") can be changed. $ Educational objective Advance directives detail patients' instructions for future medical care.

Therefore, this designated health care proxy (ie, the friend) takes legal #priority over all other decision makers# to facilitate and respect the patient's individual, informed decisions. $ In this case, even though the friend adhered to the substituted judgment standard by refusing the blood transfusion, there is an isolated report of a change in patient preference from the non–health care proxy daughter.  However, this change would be difficult to confirm and is complicated by an unknown context (eg, incapacitated, guilt induced, coerced) in which the patient may have said this #(choice A)#.  Although the reported change warrants further investigation with the health care proxy, the established health care proxy remains as the @highest priority decision maker@. $ (Choice B)  Nonmaleficence is the ethical duty to do no harm to the patient.  However, the principle that guides a health care proxy in making medical decisions is the principle of patient autonomy, which emphasize the patient's own preferences that were made when decision-making capacity was intact. $ #(Choices D and E)#  The risks (eg, transfusion-related infection, allergic reaction) and benefits (eg, \"a meaningful recovery\") of any medical intervention should always be discussed with the patient or the patient's health care proxy.  However, this patient has already communicated her decision to her health care proxy to decline more blood transfusions, which takes precedence. $ Educational objective A health care proxy is a person legally designated to make medical decisions if the patient loses decision-making capacity.  The health care proxy has more authority than all other surrogate decision makers and is expected to act in accordance with the best estimate of what the patient would have chosen.",

Most cases are due to de novo mutations in the X-linked MECP2 gene.  Rett syndrome is characterized by normal development until #age 6-18 months#, followed by a #loss of motor and language skills# and the development of #stereotypic hand movements#.  #Deceleration of head growth# is a classic feature of Rett syndrome and can be an early sign.  Other features include seizures, intellectual disability, autistic features, and breathing abnormalities. $ There is no specific therapy for Rett syndrome; many patients survive well into adulthood with severe, permanent neurologic deficits. $ (Choice A)  Features of Angelman syndrome include a happy disposition, jerky gait, and hand flapping.  Development is commonly delayed rather than initially normal. $ (Choice B)  Although this patient has deficits in verbal communication and stereotypical hand movements, she does not display other features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) such as deficits in social reciprocity, emotional restriction, or repetitive interests.  She plays and snuggles with family and appears to be trying to interact with the doctor. $ (Choice C)  Fragile X syndrome mainly affects males and is associated with CGG trinucleotide repeats on the X chromosome.  Features include intellectual disability; a long, narrow face; large protruding ears; macrocephaly; and macroorchidism. $ (Choice D)  Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is an X-linked recessive disorder characterized by a deficiency in HGPRT (hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase), leading to an increase in uric acid levels.  Although hypotonia and involuntary movements such as hand wringing may be present, developmental milestones are typically delayed rather than normal.  Gout and self-mutilating behaviors (eg, lip and finger biting) are commonly seen. $ (Choice F)  Tay-Sachs disease is a lysosomal storage disease caused by a deficiency in beta-hexosaminidase A (Hex A).  Like Rett syndrome, it presents with a regression of motor skills, but it typically begins earlier (age 2-6 months) and is associated with macrocephaly and a cherry red spot on the macula. $ Educational objective Rett syndrome is characterized by loss of speech and motor skills, deceleration of head growth, and stereotypic purposeless hand movements after a period of normal development.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors #(SSRIs)# such as citalopram or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors #(SNRIs)# are #first-line treatment#.  This patient's insomnia should improve as the medication takes effect and her anxiety decreases. $ Although this patient experienced acute relief with alprazolam, benzodiazepines are less preferred in the treatment of chronic anxiety.  Benzodiazepines (eg, alprazolam, clonazepam, diazepam) are considered second-line therapy due to the risks of dependence and tolerance, and the potential for rebound and withdrawal syndromes with abrupt discontinuation #(choices A, D, and E)#.  Benzodiazepines can be used on a limited basis to manage acute anxiety while waiting for SSRIs or SNRIs to take effect.  However, they should be avoided in patients with a history of substance use disorder. $ (Choice B)  Bupropion is a norepinephrine dopamine reuptake inhibitor approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder and smoking cessation.  It is not a first-line agent for GAD and may worsen symptoms due to its activating effects.  Bupropion should not be confused with buspirone, a non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic that is another second-line treatment option for GAD. $ (Choice F)  Propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocker, can be used as needed for the performance subtype of social anxiety disorder and in the prophylactic treatment of migraine headaches.  Beta blockers are not a first-line treatment for GAD.  This patient's headaches are related to muscle tension, which should improve as her anxiety is treated. $ Educational objective Serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors are first-line medications for generalized anxiety disorder.  Benzodiazepines should be limited to short-term use while antidepressants take effect and avoided in patients with a history of substance abuse.",

Conversion disorder is characterized by symptoms or #deficits of voluntary motor# and/or #sensory function# that are #incompatible# with any #recognized neurological condition# and cannot be explained by another medical or mental disorder.  Common symptoms of conversion disorder may include weakness, paralysis, gait disturbance, blindness, diplopia, aphonia, anesthesia, or nonepileptic seizures (also called psychogenic seizures). $ The phenomenon of la belle indifférence (ie, incongruous lack of concern about symptoms) has been associated with conversion disorder but is not pathognomonic, occurs at equal frequency in true neurological disorders, and should not be used to make the diagnosis.  In fact, patients with conversion disorder may be very distressed by their symptoms. $ (Choice A)  Body dysmorphic disorder involves an excessive preoccupation with perceived defects in physical appearance (eg, nose shape) as opposed to a neurologic deficit (eg, leg weakness). $ (Choice C)  In factitious disorder, patients deliberately falsify symptoms due to their desire to assume the sick role.  There is no evidence that this patient is intentionally falsifying her symptoms, and given her recent stress (eg, her father's heart attack), conversion disorder is more likely. $ (Choice D)  Illness anxiety disorder is characterized by excessive fears of having a serious physical disease.  The fear is usually due to misinterpretation of bodily symptoms or normal functions (eg, a man with gas pain becoming preoccupied with having colon cancer). $ (Choice E)  Malingering is the purposeful falsification of symptoms for obvious external benefit (eg, a patient feigning hemiparesis to receive disability benefits). $ (Choice F)  Somatic symptom disorder is characterized by excessive and persistent health anxiety and preoccupation with multiple somatic symptoms; it does not present with a clearly incompatible neurological examination.  This patient does not express any concern about her impairment and seeks care only when brought in by her roommate, effectively ruling out somatic symptom disorder. $ Educational objective Conversion disorder is characterized by neurologic symptoms and examination findings that are incompatible with a known neurological disease.

Due to their risk of severe adverse effects (eg, hypertensive crisis, serotonin syndrome), MAOIs are not considered first- or second-line antidepressant treatments.  However, MAOIs are still useful in certain situations when other antidepressants fail.  In addition to their role in #treatment-resistant major depressive disorder# (MDD), there is some evidence to suggest that they are superior to other classes of antidepressants in the treatment of MDD with atypical features. $ #MDD with atypical features# is characterized by #mood reactivity# (ie, mood improves in response to positive events), #leaden paralysis# (ie, patient's arms and legs feel extremely heavy), #rejection sensitivity# (ie, overly sensitive to slight criticism), and the reversed vegetative signs of #increased sleep and appetite#.  This patient is both treatment-resistant (failure of multiple antidepressant agents) and has atypical features, making him a good candidate for a trial of an MAOI. $ #(Choices A and C)#  The presence of psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions would be consistent with MDD with psychotic features.  This subtype of MDD requires the addition of an antipsychotic as it is unlikely to respond to an antidepressant alone. $ (Choice B)  Many antidepressants, including MAOIs, have sexual side effects that can worsen preexisting sexual dysfunction.  Bupropion and mirtazapine are antidepressants that do not cause sexual side effects. $ (Choice D)  Memory impairment would be a relative contraindication for use of an MAOI.  Patients taking MAOIs must be cognitively intact and remember to avoid tyramine-containing foods and drug-drug interactions that could lead to a hypertensive crisis or serotonin syndrome. $ (Choice F)  Rapid speech is a possible manic symptom that would raise concern about the presence of mixed depressive and manic symptoms.  Antidepressants, particularly MAOIs, are not indicated for patients exhibiting mixed features. $ Educational objective Monoamine oxidase inhibitors are particularly useful in patients with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder with atypical features.  Increased appetite and sleep, leaden paralysis, rejection sensitivity, and mood reactivity are hallmarks of the atypical subtype."

This patient is likely angry with his parents about the divorce, and, due to his inability to acknowledge these feelings, he projects them onto his parents.  As a result, he perceives that his parents are angry with him, even though there is little evidence that they feel this way.  Projection commonly occurs in patients who lack insight into their own motivations and feelings. $ (Choice A)  Acting out refers to expressing unwanted thoughts or impulses through actions (eg, if the boy expressed his anger by destroying his parents' wedding photographs). $ (Choice B)  Displacement involves redirecting unacceptable thoughts, feelings, and impulses intended for one person to a more neutral person or object (eg, if this patient redirected his anger at his parents toward a sibling). $ (Choice C)  Identification refers to modeling one's behavior after someone who is perceived to be more powerful or prestigious.  A classic example is the child of an abusive father who becomes a child abuser himself. $ (Choice E)  Reaction formation is the transformation of an unacceptable feeling to its opposite (eg, if instead of expressing anger, this patient behaved in an overly affectionate way toward his parents and enthusiastically supported their decision to divorce). $ (Choice F)  Regression refers to reverting to a less mature way of coping with difficulties (eg, if this patient began sleeping in his parents' room due to anxiety about being alone, which is more characteristic of an earlier developmental stage). $ Educational objective Projection is an immature defense mechanism involving the misattribution of one's unacceptable feelings or thoughts to another person who does not actually have them."

Treatment of addiction includes the use of alternative opioid agonists with fewer euphoric effects and less potential for acute withdrawal and craving, thereby allowing patients to function more productively on a daily basis.  In the United States, the most commonly used agonists are #methadone# and buprenorphine. $ Methadone is a #full mu-opioid receptor agonist# used for withdrawal and maintenance treatment for opioid use disorder.  It has a #long half-life#, which allows it to effectively #suppress cravings and withdrawal# symptoms; it also blocks the euphoric effects of other opioids by maintaining high tolerance levels #(choice B)#.  Adverse effects of methadone include QT interval prolongation and respiratory depression, accounting for its lethality in overdose. $ #(Choices C and E)#  Methadone, like other opioids, produces dependence, and abrupt discontinuation of methadone causes withdrawal symptoms.  The symptoms of methadone withdrawal are more prolonged and less severe than those of heroin due to methadone's long half-life but are still present. $ (Choice D)  Methadone can cause respiratory depression with the potential for lethality in overdose, especially when combined with other CNS depressants. $ (Choice F)  Buprenorphine is a partial agonist used alone or with naloxone (an opioid antagonist) for treatment of opioid use disorder.  Buprenorphine is less likely to cause respiratory depression and mortality in overdose compared with methadone. $ Educational objective Methadone is a potent, long-acting opioid agonist used in the maintenance treatment of opioid use disorder.  Its prolonged effects suppress withdrawal symptoms and cravings."

In the #binge eating/purging subtype#, patients engage in vomiting and/or use substances (laxatives, enemas, or diuretics) to avoid weight gain. $ Findings on physical examination in AN include emaciation, bradycardia, hypotension, hypothermia, hair loss, dry skin, lanugo (fine, downy body hair), and abdominal distension. In the purging subtype, hypokalemia and alkalosis are often present due to repetitive vomiting. $ (Choice B)  In body dysmorphic disorder, patients display a preoccupation with a perceived or slight bodily defect.  Dysmorphic disorder is not diagnosed when body distortion is accompanied by symptoms of an eating disorder (eg, low body weight, fear of weight gain). $ (Choice C)  Discrete periods of uncontrollable eating, with subsequent compensatory behavior (laxatives, diuretics, vomiting, excessive exercise), occur in bulimia nervosa.  However, patients with this condition have a normal or increased body weight (in comparison with AN in which weight is significantly decreased). $ (Choice D)  Although constipation (hypoactive bowel sounds) and fatigue can also be seen in hypothyroidism, this patient's low weight, fear of gaining weight, distorted body image, and purging make anorexia nervosa more likely. $ (Choice E)  Irritable bowel syndrome presents with chronic abdominal pain and altered bowel habits (diarrhea, constipation, or mixed-type).  Patients often have abdominal bloating.  This diagnosis would not explain signs of purging, distorted body image, and significantly low weight. $ (Choice F)  This patient does not meet the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder.  Her depressed mood, fatigue, and poor concentration are consistent with the effects of malnutrition. $ Educational objective Anorexia nervosa is characterized by a distorted body image and fear of weight gain despite significantly low body weight.  Patients may restrict their food intake and/or binge and purge.  The key in distinguishing anorexia nervosa from bulimia nervosa is abnormally low body weight."

      "explanation_2": "$This patient's response to her roommate's stethoscope is an example of #classical conditioning#.  Childhood encounters with her primary care #physician# for ear infections (#unconditioned stimulus#) caused #anxiety# (an automatic reaction called an #unconditioned response#), resulting in sweating at subsequent health care visits.  The encounters with her physician are most likely associated with the presence of a #stethoscope# (the #conditioned stimulus#).  #Repeated pairing# of the unconditioned stimulus (eg, physician encounter) with the conditioned stimulus (eg, stethoscope) allows the #conditioned stimulus alone# to #elicit# a learned, #conditioned response# (eg, sweating). $ Classical conditioning provides one explanation for \"white coat hypertension,\" a condition in which a physician's white coat or examination room acts as a conditioned stimulus, causing anxiety and transient blood pressure elevation during health care visits. $ #(Choices B, C, and D)#  In operant conditioning, rewards and punishments are used to reinforce behavior.  Negative punishment is the removal of a reward to decrease a behavior (eg, a teenager's driving privileges are taken away after returning home past curfew).  With negative reinforcement, desired behavior is strengthened through the removal of a negative outcome (eg, suffering a bad sunburn promotes application of sunscreen to prevent future sunburns). $ (Choice E)  Reaction formation is the unconscious transformation of an unacceptable impulse or emotion into its opposite (eg, if this patient tells her physician she enjoys clinic visits and acts extremely relaxed during the examination to defend against underlying anxiety). $ (Choice F)  Regression is a defense mechanism that involves unconsciously reverting to a less mature way of coping with difficulties (eg, if this patient starts sleeping with a stuffed animal to manage anxiety about an upcoming appointment). $ Educational objective Classical conditioning involves a neutral stimulus being repeatedly paired with a non-neutral stimulus that elicits a reflexive, unconditioned response.  Over time, the formerly neutral stimulus is able to evoke a conditioned response by itself in absence of the non-neutral stimulus."

      "explanation_2": "A #learning disorder# is characterized by #difficulties# with key #academic skills# (#reading#, #writing#, or #mathematics#).  Problems manifest at school age when these skills are being acquired, and performance is well below average for age.  Many children display symptoms of anxiety, inattention, defiance, or hyperactivity when under stress to perform in an area of weakness, as exemplified by this child's struggle to pay attention and his emotional outburst in class.  Learning disorders are often comorbid (eg, writing plus reading).  In addition to academic dysfunction, they can also impact social skills and self-confidence. $ Definitive diagnosis requires comprehensive assessment, including educational testing and ruling out intellectual disability, hearing or vision impairment, and other psychiatric or neurological disorders.  Providers should consider the possibility of a learning disorder in any child presenting with #school difficulty#.  Early intervention can be helpful in improving self-esteem and preventing further disability. $ (Choice A)  Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder is characterized by inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity across at least 2 settings.  There is no indication that this child struggles with inattention or hyperactivity when asked to read or do math or that this is a problem in the home setting. $ (Choice B)  Language disorder presents with difficulties in acquiring and using language, which manifests in spoken as well as written language. $ (Choice C)  Intellectual disability begins in early development and includes deficits in general mental abilities and adaptive functioning.  Specific learning disorders occur in the presence of normal levels of intellectual functioning. $ (Choice D)  In oppositional defiant disorder, there is a pattern of anger or irritability, argumentativeness, and defiant behavior.  This patient's school refusal and throwing a book are in the context of stress.  There is no indication that he is routinely defiant or argumentative. $ (Choice E)  This patient enjoys playing soccer, and his school refusal is more likely due to fears of being teased.  A diagnosis of social anxiety disorder requires persistent symptoms ≥6 months.  This boy's learning disorder should be addressed to avoid further social anxiety. $ (Choice F)  In somatic symptom disorder, anxiety revolves around a patient's symptoms.  This boy is not anxious about his stomach ache; his stomach ache is a manifestation of his anxiety about school. $ Educational objective Learning disorders are characterized by difficulties with key academic skills (reading, writing, or mathematics), resulting in performance well below expectations for age.  Providers should consider a possible learning disorder in any school-aged child with behavioral, academic, or social difficulties at school."

However, anticholinergic toxicity is characterized by both dry skin and mucous membranes rather than diaphoresis and presents with other classic anticholinergic effects (eg, urinary retention, decreased bowel sounds, hyperthermia). $ (Choice B)  Dilated pupils, diaphoresis, and tremors are not expected in a primary manic episode of bipolar disorder.  A diagnosis of bipolar disorder cannot be made if there is evidence that symptoms can be attributed to the physiological effects of a substance (eg, cocaine). $ #(Choices D and G)#  Delusional disorder is characterized by ≥1 delusions lasting for ≥1 month that are not accompanied by other psychotic symptoms.  Schizophreniform disorder may be diagnosed in patients who meet symptomatic criteria for @schizophrenia@ for >1 month and <6 months.  Neither diagnosis explains this patient's physical findings. $ (Choice E)  Opioid withdrawal presents with gastrointestinal distress (eg, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal cramping), myalgias, mydriasis, piloerection, and lacrimation.  Psychotic features are not seen. $ (Choice F)  Phencyclidine (ie, PCP) intoxication may cause psychotic symptoms and violent behavior.  It typically presents with prominent nystagmus, a finding notably absent in this patient. $ Educational objective Cocaine intoxication can produce psychotic symptoms (eg, paranoid delusions), euphoria, and agitation.  Physical signs indicating sympathetic stimulation (eg, tachycardia, diaphoresis, mydriasis) can assist in differentiating cocaine intoxication from primary psychiatric disorders.",

      "explanation_2": "This child who was previously meeting developmental milestones now has dramatic regression of speech and motor milestones accompanied by repetitive hand movements, which is concerning for #Rett syndrome# (RS).  RS is a sporadic, X-linked genetic disorder characterized by #normal development# until age 6-18 months, when #regression of speech#, loss of purposeful hand movements, development of #stereotypical movements# (eg, clapping), and #gait abnormalities# occur. $ MECP2 is a gene encoded on the X chromosome that has abundant expression in the brain.  It is thought to impact synaptic maturation and cortical maintenance.  Neuropathology is consistent with #arrested brain development# (eg, impaired dendritic maturation, reduced neuromelanin in substantia nigra) rather than death of neurons (ie, neurodegeneration).  Brain growth decelerates after birth, with no further growth after age 4. $ (Choice A)  The accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, seen in Alzheimer disease, is neurotoxic and can lead to neuronal cell death.  However, neuropathology in RS is characterized by arrested development rather than neuronal degeneration. $ (Choice C)  Copper deposition in the lenticular nucleus is characteristic of Wilson disease.  Although Wilson disease can present with neuropsychiatric symptoms, including dysarthria and ataxia, it typically presents in adolescence with liver disease; @Kayser-Fleischer rings@ are nearly always present by the time neurologic symptoms develop. $ (Choice D)  Cortical hyperexpansion seems to underly the brain enlargement associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).  Although ASD can present in toddlers with regression of speech and stereotypical movements (eg, flapping, clapping), it does not usually cause regression of gross motor milestones (eg, walking). $ (Choice E)  Hypoxic ischemic injury during delivery can lead to neonatal encephalopathy, a condition which can result in decreased level of consciousness, seizures, and impaired respiration.  However, it would present as neurologic abnormalities shortly after birth, rather than as a regression in milestones after previous normal development. $ Educational objective Rett syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by normal development until age 6-18 months, when regression of speech, loss of purposeful hand movements, development of stereotypical movements, and gait abnormalities occur.  Neuropathology shows arrested brain development rather than neurodegeneration.",

Children with conduct disorder are at greater risk for developing antisocial personality disorder as adults. $ (Choice A)  Antisocial personality disorder is not diagnosed in individuals under age 18.  It involves a pattern of violation of basic societal rules and the rights of others and requires a history of some symptoms of conduct disorder before age 15. $ (Choice B)  This patient does not have enough inattentive and hyperactive symptoms to diagnose attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and his overall behavior is more characteristic of conduct disorder. $ (Choice D)  Aggression occurs in both conduct and intermittent explosive disorders.  However, in intermittent explosive disorder, aggression is not premeditated or committed to achieve a tangible objective (eg, money, power, intimidation).  This disorder would not explain this patient's stealing and fire setting. $ (Choice E)  Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) involves a pattern of angry/irritable mood and argumentative/defiant behavior toward authority figures.  Symptoms of ODD are less severe than those of conduct disorder.  ODD does not include physical aggression, stealing, or destruction of property, as seen in this patient. $ (Choice F)  Pyromania is characterized by intentional and repeated fire setting with no obvious motive; it does not involve other behaviors seen in conduct disorder (eg, lying, theft, cruelty to others).  A separate diagnosis of pyromania is not given when fire setting occurs as part of conduct disorder. $ Educational objective Conduct disorder involves a persistent pattern of violating major societal norms or the rights of others.

It is important for practitioners to assess these milestones during routine well-child examinations to ensure the child is progressing as expected.  Failure to reach several milestones by the appropriate age, or a marked delay in one area, requires further evaluation. $ Typical gross motor milestones achieved by most 3-year-olds include the ability to ride a tricycle and walk up the stairs with alternating feet; in contrast, the ability to hop on one foot is not expected until age 5 #(choice C)#.  A 3-year-old should also be able to speak in simple sentences containing at least 3 words and know their age and sex, as seen in this patient #(choices A and D)#.  Moreover, instead of playing alongside peers (ie, parallel play), which is typical of children age 2, 3-year-olds interact more with their peers and learn by copying the actions of other children; this patient's social interactions are normal for his age, and imaginative play (\"make-believe\") is not expected until age 4 #(choice E)#. $ The concerning feature in this patient's history is his #delay in fine motor# milestones.

This patient's symptoms are not the result of a specific inciting factor. $ (Choice C)  Although some symptoms of GAD overlap with depression (ie, sleep disturbance, low energy, poor concentration), this patient is predominantly anxious.  His depression is related to his worries about social acceptance; he does not meet the full criteria for a major depressive disorder. $ (Choice D)  Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is characterized by a need for perfectionism, control, and orderliness. $ (Choice E)  In social anxiety disorder, anxiety occurs exclusively in response to social interactions in which the patient fears negative evaluation by others.  In contrast, this patient's concerns extend to multiple situations. $ (Choice F)  Patients with GAD frequently have anxiety about their health but among a range of other concerns.  In somatic symptom disorder, the distress is centered on ≥1 somatic symptoms. $ Educational objective Generalized anxiety disorder involves excessive uncontrollable worry about multiple issues with a symptom duration of ≥6 months.

      "explanation_2": "The resident's response to the patient is illustrative of #countertransference#, which consists of the physician or therapist's conscious and unconscious #reaction toward a patient# (eg, attitudes, thoughts, feelings, behaviors) that is #based on past personal relationships#.  Countertransference reactions can be positive (eg, physician takes extra time with a patient who resembles a beloved grandmother) or negative (eg, physician avoids a patient who resembles a critical parent). $ Countertransference can #interfere with medical judgment#.  In this case, the resident's negative emotions toward her father are activated when the patient dismisses her training and credentials.  The resident acts on her negative countertransference reaction and adopts an inappropriately authoritarian approach by terminating the conversation and ordering a medication.  Awareness of countertransference may prevent responses and behaviors (eg, yelling at a patient, ordering unnecessary medications/restraints, cutting an interview short) that could be harmful to patient care. $ (Choice B)  Passive aggression is a defense mechanism in which anger is expressed in a nonconfrontational manner.  Examples of passive aggressive behaviors include sarcasm, procrastination, and purposeful inefficiency. $ (Choice C)  Projection is a defense mechanism that involves misattributing one's own unacceptable feelings to another person (eg, a woman who is angry with her mother accuses her mother of being angry with her). $ (Choice D)  Reaction formation is a defense mechanism in which uncomfortable feelings are unconsciously transformed into their extreme opposites (eg, if this resident was excessively gracious to the patient to defend against underlying anger). $ (Choice E)  Regression is a defense mechanism that involves returning to an earlier level of functioning to alleviate psychological distress (eg, a child starts sucking his thumb after a sibling is born). $ (Choice F)  Transference refers to the redirection of a patient's emotions from a significant person in the past to that patient's current physician or therapist.  It may explain some patients' emotional responses to their physicians (eg, an elderly patient who feels an immediate sense of comfort and familiarity with a physician who resembles her daughter).  Transference is distinguished from countertransference by describing the patient's reaction to the provider, whereas countertransference refers to the provider's reaction to the patient. $ Educational objective Countertransference consists of a provider's response (eg, attitudes, thoughts, feelings, behaviors) toward a patient based on past personal relationships.  Countertransference can be positive or negative, conscious or unconscious; if unrecognized, it may have detrimental effects on patient care."

His symptoms first developed gradually at age 14 when he exhibited nonspecific anxiety and became increasingly paranoid that others were talking about him behind his back; he also became preoccupied with finding special meanings in certain numbers.  A year later he was hospitalized for a psychotic episode characterized by paranoid delusions and auditory hallucinations that responded rapidly to antipsychotic medication.  The patient was able to finish high school.  He was hospitalized again briefly at age 22 but has remained out of the hospital since then.

Adjustment disorder requires that symptoms develop in response to an identifiable stressor and do not meet criteria for another mental disorder. $ (Choice C)  In generalized anxiety disorder, individuals experience chronic, excessive worry for at least 6 months about multiple issues (eg, work, health, finances), which may or may not precipitate panic attacks.  In panic disorder, the content of anxious thoughts is more specific (concern about having future panic attacks) and panic attacks are unexpected. $ (Choice E)  Patients with social anxiety disorder may experience panic attacks in response to social situations (identifiable stimulus) and fear negative evaluation by others rather than the panic symptoms themselves. $ (Choice F)  Specific phobia is characterized by fear of a specific object or situation, such as flying, heights, or animals.  Panic symptoms are triggered by the phobic stimulus and are not spontaneous. $ Educational objective Panic disorder involves recurrent, unexpected panic attacks characterized by an abrupt surge of fear accompanied by physical and cognitive symptoms.

Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by pervasive anxiety about multiple issues lasting ≥6 months. $ (Choice D)  Mild sadness and anxiety are commonly experienced by mothers in response to the stress of taking care of a newborn (ie, postpartum blues).  This normal and self-limited response typically peaks at 5 days postpartum and resolves within 2 weeks.

Positive transference plays a role in patients trusting their physicians as many patients have a positive expectation that doctors are compassionate caregivers (similar to their parents).  Patients who were abused as children sometimes have difficulty seeking care or complying with the care they receive due to negative expectations of being taken advantage of or being harmed by a caregiving figure. $ (Choice A)  In acting out, unconscious feelings or impulses are expressed through actions (eg, if this patient had impulsively broken items in the psychiatrist's office due to rage at his perceived abandonment). $ (Choice B)  In displacement, a person expresses unacceptable feelings intended for one person to a more neutral person or object (eg, if this patient did not express his anger to his father and instead berated the psychiatrist).

Blaming failures on others and being #angry#, #argumentative# or resentful are also characteristic of the disorder.  Although the behavior often manifests with family members, it must also be observed during interactions with other individuals. $ For diagnosis, the oppositional behaviors must be excessive in frequency and duration when compared to normative age-appropriate behaviors.  Although adolescents may test boundaries and assert their independence, this patient's 1-year history of persistent #defiance#, skipping classes, repeated refusal to follow rules, and #irritable# mood are beyond what would be expected for a 12-year-old girl #(choice E)#. $ (Choice A)  Antisocial personality disorder is characterized by a pattern of disregard for and violation of the rights of others and is not diagnosed in individuals age <18. $ (Choice B)  Although attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is commonly comorbid with ODD, this patient does not exhibit characteristic inattentive and hyperactive symptoms.  Children with ODD should be assessed and treated for comorbid ADHD and learning disorders. $ (Choice C)  ODD should be differentiated from conduct disorder, in which the problematic behaviors are more severe and aggressive.  This patient does not exhibit destruction of property, physical aggression or cruelty toward people or animals, or the typical pattern of stealing or deceit seen in conduct disorder. $ (Choice D)  In disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, patients also present with irritable mood.  However, this is accompanied by repetitive temper outbursts (verbal or physical) that are out of proportion to the stimulus and inconsistent with developmental level.  Symptoms should manifest prior to age 10. $ Educational objective Oppositional defiant disorder is a behavioral disorder of childhood characterized by argumentative and defiant behavior toward authority figures.  It does not involve the more severe violations of the basic rights of others seen in conduct disorder."

Phosphorylated tau aggregates to form inclusions that can appear as @neurofibrillary tangles@ (similar to those seen in Alzheimer disease) or round inclusions (ie, Pick bodies). $ • #Abnormal TDP-43 protein inclusions:#  TDP-43 is a protein involved in DNA repair and transcription, and it becomes abnormally ubiquitinated in FTD.

Adolescence involves the developmental tasks of separating from the family, developing a sense of identity, and adjusting to the hormonal and physical changes of puberty.  This girl's reluctance to remove her tank top for the physical examination is likely related to her self-consciousness regarding pubertal development. $ Although differentiating normal adolescent behavior from early signs of psychiatric disorders can be difficult, this patient's engagement with school and friends is reassuring.  In contrast, adolescents exhibiting persistent anger, sadness, impulsivity, sleep or appetite disturbance, declining academic performance, and social isolation from peers warrant further evaluation. $ (Choice A)  Patients with body dysmorphic disorder are excessively preoccupied with perceived defects in their physical appearance and engage in time-consuming, repetitive behaviors (eg, mirror checking, excessive grooming) that cause significant impairment in functioning.  This patient's appearance concerns and self-consciousness about her changing body are typical of early adolescence. $ (Choice B)  Although this girl exhibits mood lability that can be seen in borderline personality disorder, she lacks the pervasive pattern of instability in interpersonal relationships and self-image, marked impulsivity, and self-injury that characterize the disorder.  Personality disorders are not diagnosed in adolescence, as the personality is still forming. $ (Choice C)  Cyclothymic disorder is a chronic, fluctuating mood disturbance involving numerous periods of hypomanic and depressive symptoms that are insufficient to meet the criteria for hypomanic or major depressive episodes.  Symptoms must be present for at least a year in children and adolescents and cause significant distress and impairment; this is not the case in this patient. $ (Choice D)  Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, a new diagnosis in DSM-5, is characterized by persistent irritability and frequent, developmentally inappropriate temper outbursts.  This patient's transient emotional outburst related to insecurity about social acceptance is consistent with normal adolescent development. $ (Choice F)  This patient does not exhibit the argumentative, defiant, and vindictive behavior required for the diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder. $ Educational objective Adolescence often involves some degree of moodiness, intense self-consciousness, and transient emotional outbursts.

Other examples include torticollis (neck muscle contraction), oculogyric crisis (forced, sustained elevation of the eyes in an upward position), opisthotonus (arching of the back with the head thrown backward), and, rarely, laryngospasm. $ Treatment of dystonic reactions consists of medications with anticholinergic properties (eg, diphenhydramine, benztropine), which alter cholinergic signaling in the striatum to decrease spontaneous movement.

It would not be diagnosed in a patient whose abnormal movements are readily explained by a medication reaction. $ (Choice D)  Symptoms of opioid withdrawal include gastrointestinal distress, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, myalgias/arthralgias, and yawning.  These symptoms are not present in this patient and opioid withdrawal would not explain her tongue protrusion. $ (Choice E)  Patients with psychotic agitation may exhibit unusual movements and postures.

Some individuals with MDD #do not report feeling depressed# due to poor recognition or concerns of stigma and may come to their primary care physicians with excessive #worry over physical health#, pain symptoms (eg, muscle aches, abdominal cramps, headaches), and other #somatic symptoms# (eg, fatigue, sleep disturbance, appetite change).  When medical illness has been ruled out, MDD should be considered high in the differential diagnosis of patients with these symptoms. $ (Choice A)  Some signs and symptoms of MDD are identical to those of a general medical condition (eg, weight loss in cancer, fatigue in hypothyroidism).  Depressive disorder due to another medical condition is diagnosed when there is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory tests that the symptoms can be entirely explained by the physiologic mechanism of another illness.  This patient's unremarkable physical examination and normal laboratory results make MDD more likely. $ (Choice B)  Patients with MDD can have worry and psychomotor agitation (eg, restlessness, fidgeting); however, generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by multiple worries, not just health anxiety, lasting ≥6 months. $ #(Choices C and E)#  Illness anxiety disorder involves an extreme level of worry about having a serious illness, followed by excessive health-related behaviors for ≥6 months.  Somatic symptom disorder involves a focus on the seriousness of bodily symptoms with excessive thoughts, anxiety, or energy devoted to them for ≥6 months.  Somatic symptoms and related disorders are not diagnosed if they arise only during an acute depressive episode. $ Educational objective Major depressive disorder can present with loss of interest or pleasure without depressed mood.

The ingested substance usually has no caloric value (eg, ice), is not a culturally accepted food source, and its consumption is not appropriate to the person's developmental level.  Pica is often associated with #nutritional deficiencies#, such as iron and zinc deficiencies. $ The 3 main types of materials consumed are #earth/soil#-rich substances, #raw starch# (eg, flour), and #ice#.  Ice is the most common, but many people ingest more than one substance.  Craving ice is particularly associated with #iron-deficiency anemia#, which is common in #pregnancy# due to increased iron requirements to supply the fetus, placenta, and expansion in maternal red blood cell mass. $ (Choice A)  Patients with anorexia nervosa restrict caloric intake to maintain a low body weight (typical BMI <18.5 kg/m2).  They may demonstrate decreased food consumption, like this patient, but they do not typically consume large quantities of ice.  Anorexia nervosa should be suspected in pregnant patients with weight loss, low body weight, and distorted body image or intense fear of weight gain. $ (Choice B)  Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder is the avoidance of eating due to unpleasant sensations (eg, taste, texture, smell) associated with a particular foodstuff or fear of the consequences of eating (eg, fear of choking or vomiting).  Although this patient has reduced her food consumption due to indigestion, she does not fear or avoid particular foods. $ (Choice C)  Bulimia nervosa involves episodes of binge eating followed by behaviors to compensate for weight gain (eg, vomiting, fasting, diuretic and/or laxative use), which are not seen in this patient. $ (Choice D)  Hyperemesis gravidarum is severe nausea and vomiting in pregnancy that can lead to weight loss and electrolyte imbalances.  In contrast, this patient's occasional nausea/vomiting (eg, twice weekly) is consistent with normal morning sickness. $(Choice E)  Patients with normal pregnancy cravings typically desire nutritive (ie, calorie-containing) foods, particularly those with a sweet or salty taste (eg, ice cream, pickles). $ Educational objective Pica is the compulsive consumption of a nonfood substance.

      "explanation_2": "$Suicide is a major public health issue that is linked to approximately 1 million deaths worldwide each year.  It is the second leading cause of death, after accidents, in those aged 15-24.  Suicide risk management involves controlling modifiable factors that decrease the risk of suicide, such as decreasing stress, improving psychosocial support, treating psychiatric illness and substance abuse, managing pain, and limiting #access to firearms# or other means of self-harm.  Other risk factors are static and cannot be modified.  These include age (teenagers and the elderly), male sex, family history of suicide, and history of previous attempts. $ Individuals with access to firearms have 3 times the #risk# of #suicide completion#, as suicide by firearm is associated with a #higher fatality rate# compared to other methods.  Due to the impulsivity often associated with suicide in teenagers, limiting this patient's access to firearms is the most important next step to decrease his risk. $ (Choice B)  Treatment for this patient's depression should be offered.  However, the next step is to advise his mother to lock away her firearm, so that the risk of completed suicide is decreased while treatment takes effect. $ (Choice C)  Providing the mother with assistance could decrease the patient's burden in the long term but is not an immediate intervention. $ (Choice D)  Although alcohol use increases the risk for suicide by impairing judgment, this teenager does not acknowledge that he has an alcohol problem and may not be willing to start counseling at this time.  Removing access to weapons is a more immediate measure. $ (Choice E)  Although decreasing this patient's isolation and improving his future prospects by helping him return to school is important in the long term, limiting access to firearms is the most pressing concern. $ (Choice F)  Chronic illness involving pain is a strong risk factor for attempted suicide.  Although the patient's Lyme disease should be treated to prevent further disability, removal of access to firearms is more likely to prevent a completed suicide at this stage. $ Educational objective Access to firearms greatly increases the risk of completed suicide.  Evaluation of a patient's access to guns is a key part of suicide risk assessment.

The major neurotransmitters involved in the pathophysiology of depression are thought to be serotonin and norepinephrine (and dopamine to a lesser extent).  Most available antidepressant medications affect serotonin or both serotonin and norepinephrine at the synapse. $ #Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors# are considered #first-line antidepressants# that work by #inhibiting# the #serotonin transporter# (SERT) protein, which is normally responsible for transporting serotonin out of the synaptic cleft back into the presynaptic neuron.  The inhibition of SERT prevents the normal reuptake of serotonin, resulting in increased availability of serotonin in the synaptic cleft. $ #(Choices A and B)# These receptor activities are the primary mechanisms of action of antipsychotics used mainly to treat schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders and to augment antidepressants in the treatment of mood disorders.  Potent antagonism of dopamine 2 receptors is the mechanism of action of first-generation antipsychotics such as haloperidol.  Second-generation antipsychotics have comparatively less affinity for D2 receptors and the additional property of serotonin 5-HT2 receptor antagonism, which underlies their lower risk of extrapyramidal side effects.  An antipsychotic would not be appropriate monotherapy for major depression without psychotic features. $ (Choice C)  Inhibition of sodium channels, resulting in stabilization of neuronal membranes, is the mechanism of action of some antiepileptic drugs (eg, carbamazepine).  These drugs also have a role as mood stabilizers in bipolar disorder but are not a primary treatment for unipolar major depression. $ (Choice E)  Inhibition of monoamine oxidase is the mechanism of action of monoamine oxidase inhibitors used in treatment-resistant depression.  These drugs are not used as first-line therapy due to their dietary restrictions and risk of serious adverse events (eg, hypertensive crisis, serotonin syndrome). $ (Choice F)  Benzodiazepines work to potentiate the effects of GABA, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, by facilitating the increased frequency of chloride channel opening in the GABA A receptor.  They have sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, and muscle relaxant properties but are not a first-line treatment for depression. $ Educational objective Most available antidepressants target the neurotransmission of serotonin or norepinephrine, or both.

      "explanation_2": "$#Delirium# is a common confusional state characterized by #altered consciousness# and cognitive disturbances such as disorientation or altered perception (eg, hallucinations, delusions).  The key features of acute onset and fluctuating course distinguish it from other cognitive (eg, dementia) and perception (eg, psychosis) disorders.  Delirium most commonly affects patients with #predisposing risk factors# (eg, advanced age, dementia, sensory impairment). $ Because #sleep-wake cycle disruption# can be both a risk factor as well as a manifestation of delirium, #facilitation of nocturnal sleep# is helpful in prevention and management.  Delirium and sleep disturbances are both significantly increased by the hospital environment (eg, ambient noise, frequent awakenings).  Minimizing noise and patient interventions at night promotes uninterrupted sleep, and physiologically appropriate lighting (ie, bright day/dim night) helps maintain circadian alignment.  These measures significantly decrease delirium incidence and sedative-hypnotic use (an additional delirium risk factor). $ (Choice B)  Benzodiazepines have a limited role in the treatment of delirium because they frequently precipitate or prolong (rather than resolve) it.  They are most useful in the setting of alcohol withdrawal (which can cause hallucinations but would also cause abnormal vital signs). $ (Choice C)  Closing window blinds during the day restricts the ability of the intrinsic circadian system to synchronize with the 24-hour day, which disrupts the sleep-wake cycle and increases delirium risk. $ (Choice D)  Removing hearing aids contributes to disorientation and sensory deprivation, thus increasing delirium risk.  Providing hearing aids helps reduce delirium incidence. $ (Choice E)  Nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pain management is desirable because opioids frequently precipitate delirium.  However, postsurgical pain also significantly increases delirium risk and typically requires pharmacologic treatment. $ Educational objective Because disruption of the sleep-wake cycle is both a risk factor and manifestation of delirium, facilitation of nocturnal sleep (eg, minimizing noise & patient interventions, appropriate day/night lighting) is helpful for delirium prevention and management."

In MDD, ≥5 of the following symptoms are present for ≥2 weeks: depressed mood, sleep disturbances, anhedonia, guilt, decreased energy, concentration difficulty, appetite changes, psychomotor retardation or agitation, and suicidality. $ (Choice F)  Patients with BPD may experience transient, stress-related paranoid ideation but do not exhibit the pervasive pattern of distrust and suspiciousness characteristic of paranoid personality disorder. $ (Choice G)  This patient's alcohol misuse is a consequence, not the cause, of her behavioral disturbance. $ Educational objective Borderline personality disorder is characterized by a persistent pattern of unstable relationships, mood lability, and impulsivity.  Individuals with this disorder may exhibit suicidal ideation or behavior in the context of an interpersonal crisis in which they feel rejected or abandoned."

Acute dystonia can develop abruptly anytime between 4 hours and 4 days after receiving an antipsychotic medication.  The condition is characterized by a sudden, involuntary contraction of a major muscle group.  Other examples of acute dystonia include oculogyric crisis (forced, sustained elevation of the eyes in an upward position), opisthotonus (arching of the back with the head thrown backward), and, rarely, laryngospasm.  The risk is highest with high-potency, first-generation antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol, fluphenazine). $ Acute dystonic reactions are theorized to result from the antipsychotic property of #D2 antagonism# in the #nigrostriatal pathway#.  In the striatum, the inhibitory effects of dopaminergic neurons (D2) are normally balanced by the excitatory actions of muscarinic cholinergic neurons (M1).  Strong dopaminergic blockade causes an excess of cholinergic activity, resulting in extrapyramidal side effects (eg, acute dystonic reactions, akathisia, parkinsonism).  Medications with M1 receptor antagonist properties, such as benztropine or the antihistamine diphenhydramine, help re-establish the dopaminergic-cholinergic balance and effectively treat acute dystonia. $ (Choice A)  Blockade of alpha-1 adrenergic receptors causes orthostatic hypotension and dizziness. $ (Choice C)  Flumazenil, a benzodiazepine GABA-A receptor antagonist, can be used to treat benzodiazepine overdose.  However, it may precipitate withdrawal seizures in patients with chronic benzodiazepine use. $ (Choice D)  Antagonism of central histamine H1 receptors causes sedation and weight gain. $ (Choice E)  Antagonism of muscarinic receptors causes anticholinergic side effects (eg, confusion, dry mouth, urinary retention).  Low-potency antipsychotics (eg, chlorpromazine, thioridazine) are more likely to cause these effects due to their strong blockade of central and peripheral muscarinic cholinergic receptors. $ (Choice F)  Second-generation antipsychotics antagonize serotonergic 5-HT2A, but this does not typically cause dystonia. $ Educational objective Acute extrapyramidal symptoms (eg, dystonia, akathisia, parkinsonism) are due to D2 blockade in the nigrostriatal pathway.

      "explanation_2": "This patient has altered mental status (eg, #impaired consciousness#, disorientation, #hallucinations#) consistent with #delirium#.  The key characteristics of #acute onset# (hours to days) and #fluctuation# distinguish delirium from other disorders with similar symptoms (eg, dementia, psychosis).  Delirium is frequently multifactorial, most often caused by an acute medical condition, drug intoxication/withdrawal, or adverse medication effect.  Underlying illness and intoxication/withdrawal are unlikely given this patient's stable vital signs, nonfocal exam, and normal laboratory values.  Therefore, #medication-induced delirium#, which is common with over-the-counter remedies for #seasonal allergies#, should be suspected. $ Drug reactions frequently cause delirium, and psychoactive agents (eg, anticholinergics, #antihistamines#, benzodiazepines, sedative-hypnotics, opioids) carry the highest risk.  Comprehensive medication review (including over-the-counter agents and other family members' prescriptions) is essential to every delirium workup.  The definitive treatment for delirium must address the #underlying cause# (eg, treat the medical illness, remove the offending medication). $ Dementia (often previously unrecognized) is among the most common risk factors for delirium, and cognitive assessment should follow delirium resolution. $ (Choice A)  Brief psychotic disorder may be diagnosed in patients with ≥1 day but <1 month of psychotic symptoms not better explained by a medical illness/medication effect.  Patients with brief psychotic disorder are typically alert without altered consciousness. $ (Choice B)  Like delirium, dementia with Lewy bodies can cause visual hallucinations and cognitive fluctuations.  However, it is marked by early executive dysfunction (eg, driving difficulty, job impairment), follows a progressive course, and has other neurologic findings (eg, parkinsonism, REM sleep behavior disorder). $ (Choice C)  Frontotemporal dementias are a group of several neurodegenerative diseases.  They can present with behavioral disturbance (eg, impulsivity, disinhibition, apathy) or language impairment (eg, aphasia).  Unlike delirium, they have a gradual onset with a progressive course, and hallucinations are atypical. $ (Choice D)  Hypothyroidism presenting as delirium is rare, but would be possible if severe (ie, myxedema coma); however, progressive lethargy with hypothermia, hypotension, and bradycardia is typically present.  Delirium is a more common manifestation of acute thyrotoxicosis. $ Educational objective Delirium involves the acute onset of fluctuating disturbances in attention (eg, altered consciousness) and cognition (eg, disorientation, hallucinations).  When no clear medical illness is apparent, medication-induced delirium should be suspected.  Psychoactive drugs (eg, anticholinergics, antihistamines, benzodiazepines, sedative-hypnotics, opioids) are common causes, and over-the-counter agents and unauthorized prescriptions should not be overlooked."

The patient fell on her outstretched hand while walking across the floor at a gym where she exercises regularly.  She has no significant medical history and takes no medications.  The patient says she avoids eating high-fat or high-carbohydrate foods because she wants to avoid \"getting bloated\" and \"gaining fat.\"  Her last menstrual period was 7 months ago.  She does not use tobacco, alcohol, or recreational drugs.  Temperature is 35.9 C (96.6 F), blood pressure is 90/58 mm Hg, and pulse is 48/min.  BMI is 18 kg/m2.  Tenderness and swelling are present over the right distal radius.  The parotid glands are enlarged and there are fine, soft hairs on her extremities.  Urine pregnancy test is negative.  X-ray reveals a nondisplaced fracture of the right distal radius and generalized radiolucency of the bone.  Which of the following is the most likely underlying diagnosis?",

      "explanation_2": "$This patient has a restricted diet, thin body habitus, and amenorrhea (last menstrual cycle 7 months ago); these features suggest #functional hypothalamic amenorrhea# (FHA), characterized by a low-estrogen state due to suppression of GnRH by chronic energy deficits.  Hypoestrogenism in FHA increases the risk for #osteoporosis#, suggested by this patient's low-trauma fragility fracture (eg, fall from standing height). $ FHA is a potential manifestation of #anorexia nervosa# (AN), an eating disorder that should be suspected in patients with the following: $ • #Low BMI# (<18.5 kg/m2) $ • #Restrictive eating# patterns or #purging# behaviors (eg, self-induced vomiting leading to parotid hypertrophy) $ •  Physiologic changes arising from chronic caloric deficits and associated #clinical starvation# (eg, bradycardia, osteoporosis, lanugo [ie, fine, downy body hair]) $ • #Distorted body image# and abnormal fear of gaining weight $ Like AN, @bulimia nervosa@ is characterized by abnormal fear of gaining weight; however, the predominant behavior pattern includes cycles of binge eating with purging (eg, vomiting, laxative abuse), and BMI is generally normal or near-normal.  Electrolyte disorders are common, but manifestations of clinical starvation, seen in this patient (eg, FHA, lanugo, osteoporosis), are inconsistent with bulimia nervosa #(choice C)#. $ (Choice B)  Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder is characterized by inadequate food intake due to lack of interest in eating (eg, dislike of sensory experience of eating).  Patients may have low BMI and signs of nutritional deficiency, but fear of gaining fat and distorted body image are not seen. $ #(Choices D and E)# Celiac disease and hyperthyroidism can cause weight loss and osteoporosis.  However, the patient's fear of gaining fat suggests an alternate diagnosis; moreover, parotid gland swelling, bradycardia, and hypothermia are not expected in either of these conditions. $ Educational objective Anorexia nervosa is characterized by low body weight (BMI<18.5 kg/m2), fear of becoming fat, and distorted body image.  Unlike other patterns of restrictive eating (eg, bulimia nervosa), patients with anorexia nervosa experience complications of progressive clinical starvation, such as bradycardia, osteoporosis, and amenorrhea.",
