These findings are consistent with a #congenital diaphragmatic hernia# (CDH), a congenital malformation caused by failure of the pleuroperitoneal folds to close. $In general, the diaphragm forms from 4 distinct tissues: the septum transversum, esophageal mesentery, musculature from the body wall, and pleuroperitoneal folds.  Extension of the #pleuroperitoneal folds# to these other structures ultimately leads to division of the pericardioperitoneal canal into the peritoneal cavity and thoracic cavity.  #Failure of closure# results in an abnormal communication between the thorax and abdomen.  This defect is usually located on the @left posterolateral side@, allowing bowel, stomach, spleen, and/or liver to herniate into the thorax.  Because this malformation occurs during organogenesis in the first trimester, compression of the developing lung leads to #pulmonary hypoplasia#. $Affected newborns have respiratory distress at birth.  Displacement of abdominal organs into the thorax causes the abdomen to appear scaphoid and the chest barrel shaped.  Ipsilateral breath sounds are decreased or absent.  Chest x-ray findings supportive of CDH include #mediastinal shift# and #thoracic bowel loops#, which may appear as cystic, fluid-filled structures. $#(Choice B)#  Failure of ventral body wall closure results in @gastroschisis@, which is characterized by bowel evisceration without a protective membrane.  A full-thickness abdominal wall defect is apparent on examination. $#(Choice C)#  The pleuropericardial membranes, which become the fibrous pericardium, fuse to separate the pericardial and pleural cavities.  Fusion defects are rare, often asymptomatic, and result in communication between these two thoracic cavities, not between the thorax and abdomen. $#(Choice D)#  @Malrotation@, characterized by incomplete physiologic rotation of the bowel in utero, usually presents with bilious emesis in infancy due to duodenal obstruction from abnormally positioned peritoneal bands.  Respiratory distress and thoracic bowel loops would not be seen. $#(Choice E)#  Abnormal separation of the dorsal (gastrointestinal tract) and ventral (respiratory tract) foregut results in @esophageal atresia@ with or without a tracheoesophageal fistula.  Symptoms include respiratory distress and choking with feeds; chest x-ray would not show cystic thoracic structures. $#Educational objective# Congenital diaphragmatic hernia is caused by failure of the pleuroperitoneal folds to close.  Immediately after birth, newborns have respiratory distress, unilateral decreased breath sounds, and a scaphoid abdomen, with imaging revealing thoracic bowel loops and mediastinal shift.  ",

  "explanation_2": "@Down syndrome (trisomy 21)@ is the most common trisomy in liveborn infants.  The diagnosis is often suspected following abnormal prenatal screening (eg, #increased nuchal translucency# on ultrasound, #decreased maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein# [AFP]) and confirmed by chorionic villous sampling or amniocentesis.  Most cases are caused by maternal meiotic nondisjunction, which results in 3 complete fetal copies of chromosome 21.  The risk for meiotic nondisjunction increases with maternal age, and women age ≥35 are at highest risk. $The most common gastrointestinal abnormality associated with Down syndrome is #duodenal atresia#.  Normally, in early gestation, epithelial proliferation briefly occludes the intestinal lumen and is followed by recanalization.  #Failure# of the duodenal lumen #to recanalize# results in duodenal atresia and intestinal obstruction.  During the first few days of life, infants classically have  bilious emesis, and x-ray findings include the @double bubble sign@, which represents the dilated stomach and proximal duodenum. $Patients with Down syndrome are also at risk for imperforate anus and tracheoesophageal fistula. $#(Choices A and C)#  Trisomies 13 and 18 may be associated with an increased risk for @open neural tube@ and @ventral wall defects@ (eg, omphalocele); trisomy 21 does not carry a similar risk.  Moreover, these defects are associated with elevated AFP in the second trimester, and this patient's low AFP (consistent with trisomy 21) makes the presence of these defects unlikely. $#(Choice D)#  @Pyloric stenosis@ is caused by hypertrophy of the pylorus and presents at age 3-6 weeks with forceful, nonbilious emesis.  Pyloric stenosis is not generally associated with Down syndrome. $#(Choice E)#  @Holoprosencephaly@ is a severe developmental defect of the forebrain (prosencephalon) that is associated with trisomy 13, not trisomy 21. $#Educational objective# Down syndrome (trisomy 21) is associated with decreased maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein and increased nuchal translucency.  Duodenal atresia, the most commonly associated gastrointestinal complication, occurs due to failure of duodenal recanalization in early gestation.  ",

  "explanation_2": "$This patient has abdominal distension and bilious emesis, findings suggestive of #intestinal obstruction#.  Because the pancreatic and bile ducts join and enter the duodenum at the major duodenal papilla, #bilious emesis# suggests obstruction #distal# to this anatomic location.  Of the options, the only defect that could cause obstruction beyond this site is #annular pancreas,# a rare congenital anomaly that occurs when the ventral pancreatic bud fails to rotate completely in utero. $The ventral pancreatic bud is a foregut derivative that appears by the fifth week of gestation.  It normally rotates behind the duodenum and fuses with the dorsal pancreatic bud during the seventh to eight weeks.  The ventral pancreatic bud gives rise to the uncinate process of the pancreatic head and the main pancreatic duct (of Wirsung).  The pancreatic tail, body, and the remainder of head derive from the dorsal bud. $In patients with annular pancreas, #incomplete ventral bud rotation# results in pancreatic tissue surrounding the second part of the duodenum; the majority of patients with annular pancreas are asymptomatic.  However, in some individuals, the circumferential pancreatic tissue can compress the duodenal lumen, causing obstruction that can be either proximal to the major duodenal papilla (nonbilious emesis) or distal (bilious emesis, as in this patient).  Annular pancreas can also result in obstructed pancreatic drainage (eg, pancreatitis). $#(Choice B)#  Failure of endoderm proliferation as the esophagus is stretched by the rapidly growing heart and liver during the fourth and fifth week of development can cause esophageal atresia (eg, excessive drooling, feeding intolerance immediately after birth).  Bilious emesis does not occur because the obstruction is always proximal to the major duodenal papilla. $#(Choice C)#  Fibrous obliteration of the biliary ducts causes biliary atresia, and patients often develop jaundice and acholic stools in the first 2 months of life due to biliary obstruction.  Signs and symptoms of intestinal obstruction would not be expected. $#(Choice D)#  Hypertrophy of the pyloric muscle causes pyloric stenosis.  Unlike this patient's bilious emesis, pyloric stenosis causes nonbilious emesis in the first 3-6 months of life due to gastric outlet obstruction (ie, proximal to the major duodenal papilla). $#(Choice E)#  Incomplete obliteration of the allantois (connects the bladder to the umbilicus in utero) leads to a @patent urachus@ or urachal cyst.  Patients have increased risk for urinary tract infections, and young infants may have vomiting and irritability, but bilious emesis would not be present and persistent umbilical discharge is typical. $#Educational objective# Annular pancreas (ie, pancreatic tissue encircling the duodenum) is caused by abnormal rotation of the ventral pancreatic bud in utero.  Although frequently asymptomatic, it can cause intestinal obstruction (eg, vomiting, abdominal distension), including bilious emesis if the constriction is distal to the major duodenal papilla.  ",

  "explanation_2": "$This newborn with bilious emesis and abdominal distension has a rectal examination consistent with #Hirschsprung disease# (HD).  During normal embryogenesis, neural crest cells migrate craniocaudally and provide parasympathetic innervation to the bowel.  HD is a congenital disorder caused by #failure of neural crest cell migration#.  The affected distal colon segment, usually confined to the #rectosigmoid# region, lacks innervation by ganglion cells (derived from neural crest cells) and is therefore #unable to relax#. $The contracted rectosigmoid colon prevents passage of gas and stool, and affected patients commonly #do not pass meconium# by 48 hours of life.  Newborns with HD may also show signs of distal intestinal obstruction, as in this patient with poor feeding, bilious emesis, and abdominal distension.  Increased rectal tone is typical, and #forceful expulsion of gas and/or stool# (\"squirt sign\") may occur with digital rectal examination due to temporary relief of the impaction. $Supportive radiographic findings of HD on contrast enema include an abrupt @transition zone@ between the #narrow aganglionic segment# and the dilated proximal colon (ie, megacolon) due to stool retention.  The absence of ganglia on rectal suction biopsy confirms the diagnosis. $#(Choices B and E)#  Meckel diverticulum, which is caused by lack of physiologic obliteration of the vitelline duct, usually presents with painless rectal bleeding; less commonly, signs of bowel obstruction can occur (eg, due to intussusception).  Congenital vascular malformations (eg, hemangioma) affecting the gastrointestinal tract would also cause recurrent rectal bleeding.  Both conditions rarely present in the newborn period, and neither causes an abnormal rectal examination. $#(Choices C and D)#  Failure of physiologic bowel recanalization causes duodenal atresia, which typically presents in newborns with bilious emesis after feeding due to proximal bowel obstruction.  Patients with intestinal malrotation may also exhibit signs of bowel obstruction.  However, rectal examination would not produce forceful expulsion of gas in either condition. $#Educational objective# Hirschsprung disease is a congenital disorder caused by failure of normal craniocaudal migration of neural crest cells during embryogenesis.  The affected colon segment (eg, rectosigmoid) lacks ganglionic innervation and is unable to relax, resulting in obstruction with failure to pass meconium and bilious emesis.  Forceful expulsion of gas and stool on rectal examination is typical.  ",

In this case, the incidental cyst within this embryologic remnant is consistent with a vitelline duct cyst. $Incomplete obliteration can result in a spectrum of anomalies: $• #Persistent vitelline duct# is due to the complete failure of duct closure and results in a patent connection between the intestinal lumen and the umbilicus.  This causes meconium discharge from the umbilicus after birth. $• #Meckel diverticulum#, the most common vitelline duct anomaly, results from partial closure of the vitelline duct, with the patent portion attached to the ileum.  A fibrous band may connect the tip of the diverticulum with the umbilicus.  Patients classically have painless hematochezia due to intestinal ulceration from heterotopic gastric mucosa contained within the diverticulum. $• #Vitelline sinus# results from partial closure of the vitelline duct, with the patent portion at the umbilicus; serous umbilical drainage may occur. $• #Vitelline duct cyst#, as seen in this patient, forms when peripheral portions of the duct obliterate but the central part remains.

The @vitelline duct@ is an embryologic remnant that connects the yolk sac to the primitive midgut, and duct closure normally occurs in early gestation.  Incomplete closure results in an ileal outpouching with a fibrous connection to the umbilicus. $Meckel diverticulum often contains heterotopic #gastric mucosa#.  Secretion of hydrochloric acid by gastric parietal cells causes ulceration and bleeding of local small bowel, resulting in typical findings of #painless lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding# and #anemia#, as seen in this patient.  Less commonly, Meckel diverticulum can present with acute abdominal pain; for example, it can serve as a lead point for intussusception, causing colicky pain and currant jelly stools.  Although presentation of Meckel diverticulum is most common at age <2, it can occur at any age. $Diagnosis is made with @99mTc-pertechnetate scan@ (ie, Meckel scan).  The radioisotope 99mTc-pertechnetate has an affinity for #parietal cells# of gastric mucosa, and increased uptake of the tracer in the periumbilical/right lower quadrant area is characteristic. $#(Choice A)#  The hindgut, supplied by the inferior mesenteric artery, gives rise to the distal colon, rectum, and upper part of the anal canal.  Arrest of hindgut descent in utero leads to an imperforate anus, which presents in neonates with failure to pass stool, not painless rectal bleeding. $#(Choices B and C)#  Failure of craniocaudal neural crest cell migration results in an aganglionic sigmoid colon/rectum that is narrow and inactive (ie, @Hirschsprung disease@), and disrupted vascular flow to the ileum results in ileal atresia.  Both conditions typically manifest with signs of obstruction (eg, abdominal distension, bilious emesis, failure to pass meconium) in a neonate, not painless GI bleeding in a 4-year-old. $#(Choice E)#  Abnormal midgut rotation around the superior mesenteric artery describes intestinal malrotation.

  "explanation_2": "This fetus has an #anterior abdominal wall defect# with herniation of bowel contents.  These findings suggest one of 2 possible diagnoses that differ based on location and covering membrane: $• @Omphaloceles@ occur due to abnormal gut rotation and failed physiologic return of bowel to the abdominal cavity during embryonic development.  Omphaloceles have herniated bowel contents confined to the umbilical cord sac, which results in a midline defect with an associated peritoneal covering #(choice E).# $• #Gastroschisis# is a congenital anomaly caused by disrupted or defective abdominal wall formation.  Because the underlying etiology is a full-thickness abdominal wall defect, the fetal bowel eviscerates into the amniotic cavity #without a covering membrane#.  The herniation is adjacent to the umbilicus (ie, #paraumbilical#), and the umbilical cord insertion site is usually normal and separate from the defect. $Because fetal bowel produces alpha-fetoprotein (@AFP@), fetuses with gastroschisis (no covering membrane) have direct AFP leakage into the amniotic fluid.  The high concentration of amniotic fluid AFP is absorbed into the maternal circulation, resulting in abnormally #elevated maternal serum AFP levels#.  Omphaloceles, by comparison, do not elevate amniotic fluid or maternal serum AFP levels as highly because the fetal bowel remains covered by peritoneum. $#(Choice A)#  In contrast to gastroschisis, congenital umbilical hernias (caused by failed closure of the umbilical fascial ring after birth) are midline defects covered by subcutaneous tissue and skin.  They are typically benign and easily reducible. $#(Choice C)#  @Hirschsprung disease@ occurs due to failure of neural crest cell migration.  Patients have an aganglionic sigmoid colon/rectum that cannot relax (eg, bowel obstruction, megacolon).  It does not present with eviscerated bowel in utero. $#(Choice D)#  @Meckel diverticulum@ results from failure of obliteration of the vitelline (omphalomesenteric) duct; the diverticulum can contain ectopic, acid-secreting gastric mucosa that ulcerates adjacent small bowel.  Therefore, the most common presentation is painless lower gastrointestinal bleeding in early childhood.  There is no associated herniation of bowel contents. $#Educational objective# Gastroschisis is a congenital abdominal wall defect characterized by herniation of uncovered bowel (ie, no covering membrane) located adjacent to the umbilicus.  It can be diagnosed on fetal ultrasound, and the condition is associated with abnormally elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels.  ",

It is not covered by skin, in contrast to this patient. $#(Choice C)#  Midgut development in the first trimester involves a physiologic occlusion of the intestinal lumen followed by recanalization.  Failure of recanalization results in duodenal atresia, which is associated with Down syndrome.

In contrast to this patient, volvulus typically presents with bilious emesis in the first month of life. $#(Choice E)#  Congenital inguinal hernias develop when the processus vaginalis, an outpouching of the peritoneum, fails to obliterate, allowing bowel contents into the inguinal canal.

Maternal serum #AFP# is #elevated# due to direct leakage from the open neural tube into the amniotic fluid. $Failure of #posterior (caudal) neuropore# closure specifically results in a NTD referred to as an @open spinal dysraphism@, and most commonly causes a #myelomeningocele# in which portions of the spinal cord within the meningeal sac protrude through a vertebral arch defect.  Prenatal ultrasound may show a #complex cystic mass #along the #lower spine#, as in this case.  Myelomeningoceles are also commonly associated with downward displacement of the hindbrain (Chiari II malformation) that can obstruct the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (causing ventriculomegaly). $#(Choice A)#  The primitive streak establishes the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo; it normally completely disappears by the end of the 4th week of gestation.  Rarely, remnants can persist in the sacrococcygeal region and give rise to a sacral teratoma. The brain would not be affected. $#(Choice B)#  @Dandy-Walker syndrome@ results from underdevelopment of the cerebellar vermis.  Ultrasound would demonstrate cystic enlargement of the posterior fossa and hypoplasia of the vermis, and elevated AFP would not be expected. $#(Choice C)#  Neural crest cells are the progenitors for the peripheral (not central) nervous system; Hirschsprung disease (congenital aganglionic megacolon) is a disorder of neural crest cell migration.  NTDs are not related to neural crest cell abnormalities. $#(Choice D)#  Neuronal migration disorders (eg, lissencephaly, or loss of sulci) are caused by the abnormal migration of nascent neurons within the brain.  A spinal mass would not be seen. $#Educational objective# Defects in primary neurulation result in open neural tube defects, such as a myelomeningocele, in which the spinal cord and meninges protrude through a vertebral arch defect.  Findings typically include an elevated maternal alpha fetoprotein and a complex cystic mass overlying the lower spine.  ",

  "explanation_2": "$This stillborn neonate has #anencephaly#, or absence of the forebrain and major portions of the skull.  Anencephaly is an #open neural tube defect# (NTD) caused by #defective primary neurulation#, an embryologic process in which the neural folds fuse in the midline to create the neural tube.  Fusion starts in the cervical region and extends rostrally and caudally to the anterior and posterior neuropores, respectively.  Failure of anterior (rostral) neuropore closure results in @anencephaly@, whereas failure of posterior (caudal) neuropore closure results in an @open spinal dysraphism@ (eg, myelomeningocele). $Most isolated NTDs are related to folate (vitamin B9) deficiency (eg, poor dietary intake).  Folate supplementation is recommended for all women of childbearing age because the neural tube develops during the time when most women are unaware of their pregnancy. $In addition to #insufficient dietary folate#, first trimester use of #medications that impair folate metabolism# are associated with a 10- to 20-fold increased risk of NTDs.  These medications include #valproate#, which is typically prescribed for bipolar disorder (likely in this patient) or epilepsy.  Others include methotrexate and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.  These medications are contraindicated in pregnancy. $#(Choices A, D, and E)#  ACE inhibitors, isotretinoin, and lithium are contraindicated in pregnancy due to teratogenic effects.  ACE inhibitors cause fetal renal damage, lithium use is associated with increased incidence of @Ebstein anomaly@, and isotretinoin is a potent teratogen that can cause a multitude of defects (eg, microcephaly, ear/facial deformities, cardiac defects).  However, use of these substances during pregnancy is not associated with NTDs. $#(Choices B and C)#  Alcohol use is associated with @fetal alcohol syndrome@; findings include a smooth filtrum, thin upper lip, and small palpebral fissures.  Heroin or other opiate use during pregnancy can lead to withdrawal in the infant postnatally (neonatal abstinence syndrome).  NTDs are not associated with prenatal alcohol or opiate use. $#Educational objective# Failure of neural tube closure results in neural tube defects (eg, anencephaly, meningomyelocele).  Folate deficiency is the greatest risk factor, and medications that impair folate metabolism (eg, valproate) are associated with an increased risk.  ",

  "explanation_2": "$This patient has a @neural tube defect@.  Like other major congenital anomalies, neural tube defects develop during the embryonic stage of fetal development, or #3-8 weeks# after fertilization (ie, weeks 5-10 of gestation).  During this crucial time, the embryo is undergoing #organogenesis#, or rapid cell division and differentiation of all major organ systems, making it particularly #susceptible to teratogens#. $The beginning of the embryonic stage is marked by @gastrulation@, which establishes 3 distinct cell layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm.  All tissues and organs are derived from these 3 layers.  Structures formed by the end of the embryonic stage include the gastrointestinal tract and lungs (endoderm); the heart, kidneys, and spleen (mesoderm); and the skin and central nervous system (ectoderm). $The central nervous system develops via @neurulation@ during the #third and fourth weeks#.  During neurulation, the neural plate forms from the ectoderm, and the lateral edges of the plate (neural folds) migrate toward the midline and fuse.  Fusion begins in the cervical region and extends rostrally and caudally, forming the neural tube (precursor to the brain and spinal cord).  The ends, or neuropores, close at the end of the fourth week.  In this case, exposure to a teratogenic medication (eg, folic acid antagonist such as valproic acid) likely occurred during #neurulation#, interfering with caudal neural tube closure and causing a #neural tube defect#. $#(Choices A and B)#  Fertilization is the process by which the male and female gametes form a zygote.  The zygote transforms into a blastocyst, which implants in the uterine wall approximately 1 week after fertilization.  Significant teratogenic exposure prior to gastrulation usually results in spontaneous abortion or no abnormalities, as the undamaged pluripotent cells can fully compensate if enough survive. $#(Choices D and E)#  The central nervous system matures throughout pregnancy and can be affected by teratogens beyond the first 8 weeks (eg, alcohol causing fetal alcohol syndrome).  However, defects related to neural tube formation (neurulation) occur only during the early embryonic period. $#Educational objective# Organogenesis occurs in the embryonic stage of development (3-8 weeks after fertilization), during which time the embryo is particularly susceptible to teratogens.  Neurulation (neural tube formation) occurs during weeks 3 and 4, and abnormalities in this process result in neural tube defects.  ",

Similarly, much of the rudimentary mesonephros degenerates, although a portion (the mesonephric duct) persists as the ureteric bud.  This patient has horseshoe kidney, a congenital defect involving the renal parenchyma, which is derived only from the metanephric blastema, a component of the metanephros. $#(Choice E)#  Although the nephric systems (including pronephros, mesonephros, and metanephros) are all derived from the urogenital ridge, this structure also gives rise to the gonads, reproductive tract, and adrenal cortex in addition to the kidney.  Horseshoe kidney is due to fusion of the metanephros alone. $#Educational objective# Horseshoe kidney is a congenital anomaly in which fusion of the metanephros (specifically, metanephric blastema) results in fused renal parenchyma along the inferior poles.  Most patients are asymptomatic, but some may develop recurrent urinary tract infections or nephrolithiasis due to abnormal urine flow through the malpositioned kidney and ureters.  ",

  "explanation_2": "$This mother has oligohydramnios, and the fetus has bilaterally enlarged cystic kidneys.  Because amniotic fluid is largely composed of fetal urine, these findings are concerning for fetal kidney dysfunction and reduced urine production.  In this case, the fetus likely has #autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease# (ARPKD), a condition caused by a mutation in fibrocystin (protein found in epithelial cells of renal tubules).  Fibrocystin deficiency leads to diffuse microcysts, as seen here, and impaired kidney function. $Any condition that causes #anuria or oliguria in utero# (eg, ARPKD, bilateral renal agenesis) results in #severe oligohydramnios# and risk of Potter sequence.  #Potter sequence# is a predictable series of anomalies caused by fetal compression from insufficient amniotic fluid.  Findings include the following: $• #Flattened facies:#  Extrinsic fetal compression leads to a flattened, depressed nasal bridge; prominent epicanthal folds; low-set ears; and a recessed chin. $• #Limb deformities:#  Restricted fetal movement causes deformities such as contractures, hip dislocation, and clubfoot. $• #Pulmonary hypoplasia:#  Restricted thoracic expansion limits fetal lung development, causing respiratory distress and decreased breath sounds after birth.  Amniotic fluid is also thought to promote production of elastin, collagen, and vascular endothelial growth factor in fetal lungs, and oligohydramnios likely results in reduced alveolarization and angiogenesis. $Potter sequence is often fatal in infancy, and patients who survive typically develop chronic lung and kidney disease. $#(Choice A)#  Bladder outlet obstruction (eg, posterior urethral valves) causes bladder distension, bilateral hydronephrosis, and in severe cases impaired kidney function and oligohydramnios.  However, in contrast to this case, renal cysts would not be present. $#(Choice B)#  Cerebral aneurysms are a common complication of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.  However, most patients remain asymptomatic until adulthood; ARPKD is much more likely in this neonate with severe renal impairment. $#(Choice C)#  Segmental facial hemangiomas may be associated with other anomalies, as in the PHACE syndrome (abnormalities of the #P#osterior fossa; #H#emangiomas; and #A#rterial cerebrovascular, #C#ardiac, and #E#ye anomalies).  Vascular tumors are not associated with ARPKD or Potter sequence. $#(Choice D)#  Intestinal atresia is associated with excessive, not reduced, amniotic fluid (polyhydramnios) due to impaired fluid absorption by the fetal gastrointestinal tract.  Furthermore, this patient's renal findings would not be expected in a patient with intestinal atresia. $#Educational objective# Amniotic fluid is largely composed of fetal urine, and oligohydramnios (low fluid) is often associated with kidney dysfunction in the fetus (eg, diffuse cysts seen in autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease).

The finding is most commonly #unilateral#, mild, and transient, likely related to a temporary narrowing in the #ureteropelvic junction# (UPJ) during normal development, as the fetal renal pelvis is highly compliant and susceptible to dilation.  In this case, however, the dilation is severe, making a pathologic cause more likely. $The most common pathologic cause of antenatal hydronephrosis is persistent UPJ #obstruction# due to an embryologic defect that develops as follows: $• The fetal @genitourinary tract@ is derived from the metanephric blastema and the ureteric bud (a dorsal outgrowth of the mesonephric duct).  The metanephric blastema develops into functional renal parenchyma by 10 weeks gestation while the ureteric bud develops into the renal pelvis and ureters through sequential dilation and canalization.  The UPJ is the last segment of the fetal ureter to canalize. $• The pathogenesis of fetal UPJ obstruction likely involves #canalization failure# resulting in stenosis of the proximal ureter.  Most cases are unilateral and cause hydronephrosis with calyceal/renal pelvic dilation and without ureteral dilation.  If the condition is not diagnosed prenatally, it may present with a palpable abdominal mass (enlarged kidney) on examination. $#(Choice A)#  Neurogenic causes of obstructive uropathy (eg, spinal cord damage) result in bilateral hydronephrosis along with hydroureter due to dysfunctional voiding. $#(Choices C and D)#  Obstruction of the urethra or urinary meatus causes bilateral, not unilateral, hydronephrosis in addition to ureteral dilation.  The most common cause in boys is @posterior urethral valves@ or obstructive urogenital membranes at the junction of the bladder and urethra.  Other congenital anomalies at this anatomic level that would also cause bilateral fetal hydronephrosis include urethral strictures, meatal stenosis, and bladder neck obstruction. $#(Choice E)#  Abnormalities at the vesicoureteral junction (eg, congenital anomaly, renal calculi) can cause obstruction but are rare and would lead to ureteral dilation (not seen here) if severe enough to cause hydronephrosis.  Similarly, @vesicoureteral reflux (VUR)@, a common cause of fetal hydronephrosis, is also associated with ureteral dilation/tortuosity. $#Educational objective# Inadequate canalization of the ureter at the ureteropelvic junction (the connection site between the kidney and the ureter) is the most common cause of severe, unilateral fetal hydronephrosis.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient's imaging findings are consistent with a congenital urachal anomaly.  In utero, the caudal yolk sac forms a tubular outpouching called the allantois, which extends from the embryologic bladder to the umbilicus.  As the #bladder descends# into the fetal pelvis, it #stretches the allantois#, which becomes thin and narrow.  Normally, epithelial proliferation obliterates the lumen of the allantois by 12 weeks gestation, forming a #fibrous cord# known as the #urachus#. $Failed or inadequate epithelial proliferation leads to a complete or partial patent urachus: $• Complete patent urachus:  Neonates usually have urinary umbilical drainage on presentation due to a continuous connection from the bladder to the umbilicus. $•  Partial patent urachus#:#  A range of defects may occur depending on the location of the patency, including a urachus that is open only to the umbilicus (urachal sinus), to the bladder (urachal diverticulum), or centrally (urachal cyst). $This patient with a normal abdominal examination most likely has a #urachal diverticulum#, as seen on imaging as a linear extension of urine from the bladder toward the umbilicus.  #Urinary stasis# within the diverticulum is a risk factor for recurrent #urinary tract infection#, as seen in this case. $#(Choice A)#  Similar to the allantois, the @omphalomesenteric@ (or vitelline) duct is a tubular outpouching of the yolk sac that involutes in early gestation.  However, because it connects the yolk sac to the fetal midgut, failed obliteration results in a connection between @umbilicus and bowel@ (not bladder). $#(Choices B and C)#  The umbilical arteries and vein are contained within the umbilical cord, and abnormalities (eg, single umbilical artery) are usually isolated.  These vascular structures are not connected to the bladder lumen. $#(Choice E)#  The ureters are derived from the @mesonephric duct@, and abnormalities may result in ectopic ureteral insertion along the mesonephric system (eg, urethra).  A midline bladder diverticulum directed toward the umbilicus would not be expected. $#(Choice F)#  The urorectal septum divides the cloaca into the distal anorectal and urogenital regions.  Developmental abnormalities would not explain this patient's abnormal urinary flow from the bladder to the umbilicus. $#Educational objective# Congenital anomalies of the urachus result in an abnormal connection between the bladder and the umbilicus.  Full patency results in urinary umbilical leakage, whereas partial patency can result in a range of defects, including a bladder diverticulum (increases the risk of urinary tract infection due to stasis of urine).

  "explanation_2": "$This young patient had a #cryptogenic stroke#, which is evaluated with echocardiography with a \"bubble study\" to identify right-to-left intracardiac shunts.  This study is performed by injecting agitated normal saline intravenously and observing for microbubbles in the left heart.  Shunt detection is improved by having the patient release a sustained Valsalva maneuver, which increases right atrial pressure.  Cryptogenic stroke is frequently associated with atrial septal abnormalities such as #patent foramen ovale# (PFO) and atrial septal defect (ASD). $During fetal development, the foramen ovale shunts oxygenated fetal blood across from the right to the left atrium.  After delivery, umbilical cord clamping and decreased pulmonary vascular resistance lower right atrial pressure and raise left atrial pressure.  This pushes the #septum primum# against the #septum secundum#, closing the foramen ovale.  Over time, fibrosis and tissue remodeling fuse the flap closed.  #Incomplete fusion# occurs in approximately 25% of normal adults, resulting in a PFO. $PFO usually remains functionally closed and asymptomatic after birth as left atrial pressure is greater than right atrial pressure.  However, conditions that raise right atrial pressure above left atrial pressure (eg, Valsalva release) produce a transient right-to-left shunt across the PFO.  This is particularly concerning in patients with hypercoagulability (eg, oral contraceptive use) as they are at increased risk for venous thrombosis and #paradoxical brain embolism#.  Chronically elevated right heart pressure (eg, Eisenmenger syndrome) is not necessary for paradoxical embolism. $#(Choice A)#  ASD results from aplasia of the septum primum or septum secundum during development.  Although ASD may lead to paradoxical embolism, it is much less common than PFO and characterized by fixed splitting of S2.  Unrepaired ASDs may lead to heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, or Eisenmenger syndrome. $#(Choice B)#  Incomplete development of the aorticopulmonary septum results in @truncus arteriosus@, which causes cyanosis in newborns and requires early surgical repair. $#(Choice C)#  Incomplete closure of the interventricular foramen results in @ventricular septal defect@ (VSD), which causes a holosystolic murmur at the lower left sternal border.  Large VSDs can cause significant left-to-right shunting, leading to heart failure in infancy; however, VSDs infrequently lead to paradoxical embolism. $#(Choice E)#  The ductus arteriosus functionally closes within 24 hours after delivery.  Persistent @patent ductus arteriosus@ causes a continuous murmur and may eventually result in heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, or Eisenmenger syndrome. $#Educational objective# The foramen ovale is patent in approximately 25% of normal adults.  Although the foramen ovale usually remains functionally closed, transient increases of right atrial pressure above left atrial pressure can produce a right-to-left shunt, leading to paradoxical embolism of venous clots into the arterial circulation.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient's clinical presentation (#cyanotic spells# that improve with #squatting#, prominent right ventricular impulse, #systolic murmur#) is consistent with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF).  Abnormal neural crest cell migration leads to anterior and cephalad deviation of the infundibular septum during embryologic development, resulting in a malaligned VSD and an overriding aorta.  TOF is characterized by 4 distinct anatomic abnormalities: $• Ventricular septal defect (VSD) $• verriding aorta over the right and left ventricles $• Right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) obstruction $• Right ventricular hypertrophy $Cyanosis occurs due to the presence of right-to-left shunt in patients with severe or worsening #RVOT obstruction#.  The typical harsh, systolic ejection murmur over the mid-to-left upper sternal border is due to the presence of RVOT obstruction (subvalvular, pulmonary valve stenosis or supravalvular narrowing in the main pulmonary artery).  Squatting increases the peripheral systemic vascular resistance (afterload) and decreases the degree of right-to-left shunting across the VSD, thereby improving cyanosis. $#(Choice A)#  In @anomalous pulmonary venous return@, blood from both the pulmonary (oxygenated) and systemic (deoxygenated) venous systems flow into the right atrium, leading to right atrial and ventricular dilation.  Patients also have obligatory right-to-left atrial shunting. $#(Choice B)#  Aortic arch constriction results in @coarctation of the aorta@ and is most commonly located just distal to the left subclavian artery (juxtaductal).  Common manifestations include brachial-femoral pulse delay and blood pressure discrepancy between the upper and lower extremities. $#(Choice D)#  Failed fusion of the superior and inferior endocardial cushions (eg, endocardial cushion defect) results in defects of the atrioventricular septum and valves (mitral and tricuspid valves).  These typically manifest initially as atrial defects and/or VSDs with left-to-right shunting of blood.  Over time, the increased right-sided blood flow leads to pulmonary hypertension with reversal of blood flow through the shunt and development of cyanosis (@Eisenmenger syndrome@).  This patient has had cyanotic symptoms since birth that would not be expected with an isolated endocardial cushion defect. $#(Choice E)#  @Transposition of the great arteries@ results from linear, rather than spiral, development of the aorticopulmonary septum in utero. $#Educational objective# Tetralogy of Fallot results from anterior and cephalad deviation of the infundibular septum during embryologic development, resulting in a malaligned ventricular septal defect (VSD) with an overriding aorta.  As a result, the patient has right ventricular outflow obstruction (resulting in a systolic murmur) and squats to increase the peripheral systemic vascular resistance (afterload) and decrease right-to-left shunting across the VSD.

  "explanation_2": "$This newborn's echocardiogram is indicative of #transposition of the great arteries# (TGA), a cyanotic congenital heart defect characterized by @abnormal origination@ of the aorta/pulmonary artery.  In early gestation, there is a single outflow tract from the rudimentary heart that is subsequently divided into the aorta and pulmonary artery by the #aorticopulmonary septum#.  This septum normally spirals during outflow tract division to create an anteriorly located pulmonary artery arising from the right ventricle and a posteriorly located aorta arising from the left ventricle. $TGA occurs due to #failed spiraling# of the aorticopulmonary septum, resulting in an #anterior aorta# that originates from the right ventricle and a #posterior pulmonary artery# that originates from the left ventricle.  @Parallel@ pulmonary and systemic circuits are created, and #deoxygenated blood# is delivered from the right ventricle to the #systemic circulation# via the aorta. $Neonates with TGA often have cyanosis, tachypnea, and tachycardia immediately after birth; however, some may have normal examination findings initially due to shunting of oxygenated blood to the systemic circulation via the @ductus arteriosus@, with cyanosis developing after 24-48 hours as the ductus begins to close.  Other mixing lesions, such as a large ventricular septal defect, can also mask the development of clinically-apparent cyanosis.

PDA in a patient with TGA tends to delay the development of cyanosis. $#(Choice D)#  Failed conotruncal septation results in persistent @truncus arteriosus@.  Although affected patients typically develop neonatal cyanosis, an echocardiogram would reveal a single arterial trunk.  This patient's distinct aorta and pulmonary artery indicate conotruncal septation has occurred. $#Educational objective# Transposition of the great arteries is a cyanotic congenital heart condition resulting from failed spiraling of the aorticopulmonary septum during embryonic development.

This congenital anomaly is related to abnormal in utero development of the pharyngeal apparatus, an early embryologic structure comprising the following: $• Pharyngeal (or branchial) arches:  Six pairs of @arches@ are precursors to the bones, muscles, and vasculature of the face, neck, and pharynx. $• Pharyngeal pouches:  The inner surface of the arches is lined by endoderm, and the pockets created by each arch are @pouches@, which differentiate into distinct fetal structures (eg, third pouch forms the thymus). $• #Pharyngeal clefts# (or grooves):  The outer surface of the arches is lined by ectoderm, and the clefts are the recesses between the arches.  Most clefts #obliterate#; for example, the second, third, and fourth clefts merge to form the cervical sinus, which then involutes. $#Failed obliteration# of a pharyngeal cleft leaves a pathologic remnant in a predictable anatomic location.

The cyst is often unrecognized until #secondary infection# leads to a tender, fluctuant mass with or without purulent drainage (ie, sinus, fistula). $#(Choice A)#  The parathyroid glands are derivatives of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches; failure to descend to their anatomic position leads to ectopic glands.  An associated adenoma can lead to symptoms of persistent hyperparathyroidism (eg, bone disease, nephrolithiasis), not a fluctuant mass and drainage. $#(Choice B)#  Failed neural crest cell migration to the pharyngeal arches would affect development of skeletal structures of the face and neck (eg, bone, cartilage) and would not explain a cystic mass. $#(Choice C)#  Inadequate fusion of the mandibular prominences (derivatives of the first pharyngeal arch) is rare and affects development of the lower lip, lower jaw, and tongue, findings not seen in this patient. $#(Choice E)#  In utero, the thyroid gland descends from the base of the tongue to its final position down the thyroglossal duct, which then obliterates.  A persistent thyroglossal duct can lead to a @cyst@ along the path of descent that can become secondarily infected, but the cyst would be midline. $#Educational objective# Branchial cleft cysts are most often located anterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and result from incomplete obliteration of a pharyngeal cleft (or groove).

  "explanation_2": "In the terminal saccular stage of lung development, the type II pneumocytes produce pulmonary surfactant, a lipoprotein complex rich in phospholipids, most notably #dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine# (DPPC, a type of lecithin).  This surfactant #decreases# alveolar #surface tension# by creating a lipid-rich monolayer that separates alveolar gas from the underlying aqueous fluid.  The phenomenon prevents atelectasis and end-expiratory collapse and increases pulmonary compliance. $In a fetus, efflux of lung fluid into amniotic fluid enables testing of markers of lung maturity.  Until 33 weeks gestation, the lecithin and sphingomyelin levels are about equal.  After 33 weeks, the lecithin levels rise dramatically compared to sphingomyelin.  A lecithin-to-sphingomyelin ratio >1.9 is indicative of mature fetal lungs. $Premature infants born at <32 weeks gestation are at significant risk of surfactant deficiency.  Corticosteroids (eg, #betamethasone, dexamethasone#) have the greatest effect on increasing surfactant production by accelerating #maturation of type II pneumocytes#.  They are administered to patients at risk for preterm labor (eg, preterm premature rupture of membranes) to decrease the risk of respiratory distress syndrome and mortality. $#(Choice B)#  Uncontrolled maternal hyperglycemia causes fetal hyperinsulinemia and inhibits the maturational effects of cortisol and the production of surfactant proteins.  Infants of these mothers can develop respiratory distress syndrome.  Although corticosteroids cause temporary hyperglycemia, the beneficial effects of maternal steroid administration on surfactant production and eventual reduction of mortality far outweigh this side effect. $#(Choice C)#  In pregnancies at risk for preterm delivery, antenatal administration of magnesium sulfate has been shown to decrease the risk for cerebral palsy.  While cerebral palsy can result in permanent neurologic disability, impaired lung function is a more common cause of death in premature infants. $#(Choices D and E)#  Nifedipine and terbutaline are medications used for inhibition of preterm labor (tocolysis).  Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker and results in myometrial relaxation by inhibition of myosin light-chain kinase-mediated phosphorylation.  Terbutaline is a β-sympathomimetic that increases intracellular cAMP formation in myometrial cells.  This inhibits myosin light-chain kinase and relaxes the smooth muscle.  Neither drug directly affects fetal lung maturity. $#Educational objective# Both maternal and fetal cortisol help to accelerate fetal lung maturation by stimulating surfactant production.  Betamethasone or dexamethasone is administered to pregnant women at risk of premature delivery to prevent neonatal respiratory distress syndrome.  "

Causes of #increased fetal urination# include high cardiac output due to anemia or twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome.  #Maternal diabetes# and #multiple gestations# tend to cause milder polyhydramnios compared to the aforementioned major fetal anomalies. $This patient's prenatal use of anti-epileptic therapy (eg, valproate, carbamazepine, phenytoin) is a substantial risk factor for fetal neural tube defects such as anencephaly.  Like anencephaly, spina bifida #(choice F)# is a group of neural tube defects (eg, occulta, meningocele, myelomeningocele) that can result from maternal folic acid deficiency and use of folic acid antagonists (anti-epileptic drugs, trimethoprim).  However, spina bifida occulta, the mildest form, is not associated with polyhydramnios as fetal swallowing of amniotic fluid remains normal. $#(Choice B)#  Atrial septal defects (ASDs) are one of the most common congenital heart diseases.  ASDs are usually asymptomatic in utero.  The diagnosis is usually made after birth based on wide fixed splitting of S2 on physical examination.  ASDs are not associated with polyhydramnios. $#(Choices C, D, and E)#  Renal agenesis is associated with severe oligohydramnios (too little amniotic fluid) after 16 weeks of gestation when the majority of the amniotic fluid is derived from fetal urine.  @Posterior urethral valves@ in male fetuses can also result in decreased fetal urine output and oligohydramnios.  Oligohydramnios, in turn, can lead to excessive fetal compression causing flat facies and limb deformity (ie, @Potter sequence@).  Pulmonary hypoplasia is a consequence of oligohydramnios and is not associated with polyhydramnios. $#Educational objective# Polyhydramnios (excessive accumulation of amniotic fluid) presents with increased abdominal circumference out of proportion to gestational age.  The etiology is decreased fetal swallowing or increased fetal urination.  Fetal anomalies associated with impaired swallowing include gastrointestinal obstruction (eg, duodenal, esophageal, or intestinal atresia) and anencephaly.  ",

  "explanation_2": "This newborn patient has #talipes equinovarus# (@clubfoot@), a congenital anomaly in which one or both feet are excessively plantarflexed and swung inward.  Clubfoot is a #deformation#, a type of anomaly that occurs when #abnormal mechanical forces #impinge upon an otherwise normally developing fetal structure, leading to# alterations in shape or position#.  Risk factors include any condition that #restricts fetal movement#, such as breech presentation, uterine fibroids, or multiple gestation. $Although some deformations can improve once the extrinsic constraint is no longer present (ie, after birth), prolonged/severe mechanical forces in utero may cause significant, often permanent, structural changes.  In cases of clubfoot, mechanical forces may contribute to defects in the developing bones, muscles, or tendons, resulting in a rigid abnormality (not seen in this patient with normal range of motion). $#(Choice B)#  Disruption refers to arrested development or destruction of a structure that was previously developing normally; it is often triggered by interruption of the blood supply.  For example, @amniotic bands@, which are fibrous tissues that can encircle and constrict fetal limbs, may lead to amputation of a distal extremity.  This patient's abnormal limb positioning is more indicative of deformation due to extrinsic compression rather than a disruptive insult. $#(Choice C)#  Dysplasia describes an inherent defect in tissue development due to the abnormal organization of cells.  For example, achondroplasia is characterized by defective endochondral bone formation due to a genetic mutation resulting in skeletal anomalies. $#(Choice D)#  A malformation is due to a primary defect (eg, genetic, teratogenic) in embryonic development that prevents the proper development of a structure.  For example, @spina bifida@, a malformation of the spine and spinal cord, is caused by failure of neural tube closure (in contrast to clubfoot, in which limb development proceeds normally until late gestation) $#(Choice E)#  A sequence refers to a group of anomalies that represent a cascade effect from a single defect.  For instance, @Potter sequence@ is characterized by flat facies, pulmonary hypoplasia, and limb deformities (eg, clubfoot) resulting from oligohydramnios due to a urinary tract anomaly.  However, this patient has isolated feet deformities. $#Educational objective# A deformation anomaly is caused by abnormal extrinsic forces on a developing fetus.
