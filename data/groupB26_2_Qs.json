In this case, it is likely that the new #iron supplement# is interacting with tetracycline to cause #decreased absorption# of the antibiotic. $#Tetracyclines# interact with #polyvalent cations# to form #nonabsorbable chelate complexes# in the gastrointestinal tract.  This effect is prominently seen with iron and is also common with other polyvalent metals (eg, aluminum, calcium, magnesium) found in widely used over-the-counter preparations (eg, antacids).  Other drugs susceptible to chelation include fluoroquinolones and thyroxine. $The extent of chelation is influenced by gastric pH; the introduction of medications that raise gastric pH (eg, H2-blockers [eg, famotidine], proton pump inhibitors [eg, omeprazole]) can sometimes lead to increased chelation and loss of drug effect.  Chelation can often be avoided by taking the medications at different times of the day. $#(Choice A)#  Combination oral contraceptives suppress androgenic activity and reduce production of sebum.  This typically leads to improvement, rather than worsening, of acne. $#(Choice B)#  Clinically significant resistance to tetracyclines is uncommon in acne and unlikely to occur abruptly.  In addition, besides antimicrobial effects, tetracyclines have anti-inflammatory effects in acne that would likely provide residual benefit. $#(Choice D)#  Tetracyclines such as doxycycline and tigecycline are eliminated by hepatic excretion.  Neither iron nor oral contraceptives would increase drug elimination. $#(Choice E)#  Estrogens increase the synthesis of sex hormone‚Äìbinding globulin, which can affect plasma levels of certain steroid hormones and related agents (eg, danazol, levonorgestrel).

Drugs that are largely inactivated by first-pass metabolism (ie, low oral bioavailability) are often administered by a route that bypasses the portal circulation (eg, intravenous, sublingual). $#Rectal administration# (via suppository) allows a drug to #partially escape# first-pass metabolism.

However, the region #below the dentate line# drains into the systemic circulation via the middle and inferior rectal veins (which drain to the internal iliac and internal pudendal veins, respectively).  For a drug that is inactivated by first-pass metabolism, the rectal route allows a higher proportion of the drug to bypass portal circulation, increasing bioavailability. $#(Choices B, C, and D)#  For orally administered drugs, the small intestine is a major site of absorption owing to its large surface area and high blood flow rates.  In contrast, the rectum has a much smaller surface area, lower blood flow rates, and often contains absorptive stool.  Therefore, rectally administered drugs are typically absorbed more slowly and erratically compared to orally administered drugs. $#(Choice E)#  Reduced renal blood flow causes a decrease in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which in turn slows elimination of renally excreted drugs (ie, increases bioavailability).  Patients with reduced GFR may require a lower dose to prevent adverse effects.  However, the route of administration does not impact drug clearance. $#Educational objective# Drugs administered orally must pass through the portal circulation and are subject to first-pass metabolism by intestinal and hepatic enzymes.

The CL rate is constant for most drugs and depends on the particular metabolic conversion (eg, glucuronidation to inactive form) and/or elimination pathways (eg, biliary or urinary excretion) used to remove the drug from the body.

Drugs with high intrinsic hepatic clearance tend to have high lipophilicity and a high volume of distribution.  Highly lipophilic drugs tend to be poorly eliminated in the kidney as these agents rapidly cross tubular cell membranes after filtration to reenter the tissues. $High lipophilicity (lipid solubility) allows the drug to cross cellular barriers more easily and enter hepatocytes.

This can result in higher serum drug levels and a prolonged elimination phase, which can be particularly important for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index (eg, digoxin, antiarrhythmics). $In this example, #serum metformin levels# are seen to #increase# in animals with experimentally induced heart failure.  Because metformin is #renally cleared#, this effect is most likely due to #decreased renal blood flow# as a result of reduced cardiac output.  Because of the risk of lactic acidosis, metformin should be used with caution in patients with heart failure or impaired renal function from other causes. $#(Choices A and D)#  Heart failure frequently causes high central venous pressure and hepatic congestion.  The resulting impairment in nutrient and oxygen delivery leads to hepatocellular damage and downregulation of CYP enzymes involved in drug metabolism.  Reduced hepatic blood flow also results in decreased drug delivery to the liver, further impairing hepatic drug metabolism and clearance.  However, metformin is not metabolized by the liver; it is excreted unchanged by the kidney. $#(Choice C)#  Decreased tissue perfusion in heart failure typically leads to a reduced volume of distribution of most drugs.  Although the extracellular fluid accumulation that occurs in decompensated heart failure can potentially increase the volume of distribution of water-soluble drugs, this increased distribution volume would result in a decrease in serum drug levels. $#(Choice E)#  Increased central venous pressure in heart failure can lead to intestinal wall edema with increased intestinal wall thickness.  This can result in delayed or decreased intestinal drug absorption.  However, this effect would be expected to cause reduced serum drug concentrations and delayed peak levels. $#Educational objective# Heart failure leads to reduced liver and kidney perfusion, resulting in reduced drug clearance.  Metformin is excreted unchanged by the kidney; therefore, patients with significant renal insufficiency due to heart failure or other causes (eg, chronic kidney disease) are at increased risk of toxicity (eg, lactic acidosis).

The volume of distribution is determined by administering a given amount of drug by the intravenous route and subsequently measuring the initial plasma concentration of the drug.  The formula is as follows: $#‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉVd (L) = amount of drug given (mg) / plasma concentration of drug (mg/L)# $The average total body water is approximately 41 liters.  Of that, the extracellular fluid volume is about 14 L, or 1/3 of total body water.  Within the extracellular fluid, the plasma volume is about 3 L, and interstitial fluid makes up the rest.  Initially, the drug enters the plasma compartment by the IV route.  If a drug has a large molecular weight, is bound extensively to plasma proteins, or is highly charged (hydrophilic), then the drug generally remains in the plasma compartment and the volume of distribution is usually low as in the case above (about 3-5 liters).  If the drug has a small molecular weight but is hydrophilic, it can distribute into the interstitial fluid compartment outside of the blood vessels as well as in the intravascular compartment.  In these cases the volume of distribution is limited to a total volume of about 14-16 liters (plasma volume plus interstitial volume).  If the drug has a small molecular weight and is also uncharged (hydrophobic or lipophilic), then the drug can cross cell membranes and reach intracellular compartment.  These drugs have the highest volume of distribution (41 liters).  Drugs that are avidly bound in the tissues exhibit the highest volumes of distribution, often much higher than the total body water volume, because these drugs accumulate readily within cells thereby maintaining low plasma concentrations. $#(Choice A)# If the molecular weight of the drug is low, then the drug will tend to easily pass through endothelial junctions into the interstitial fluid, making the volume of distribution at least 14 liters.  The Vd may be higher if the drug is also hydrophobic. $#(Choice B)# Lipophilic drugs tend to readily cross cell membranes and distribute widely outside the plasma and interstitial compartments.  This tendency to collect within cells gives these drugs a high volume of distribution. $#(Choice C)# A drug with a Vd of 4.5 L, which is approximately the same as the plasma volume, is likely to be highly bound to plasma proteins such as albumin.  Binding to plasma proteins tends to retain drug in the plasma compartment and prevent the diffusion of drug into the extravascular compartments.  If this drug were not bound to albumin, it would be more likely to diffuse into the interstitium and a higher Vd would be expected. $#(Choice E)# Bioavailability is a measure of absorption and is unrelated to the distribution of a drug. $#Educational objective# Characteristics of a drug such as high molecular weight, high plasma protein binding, high charge, and hydrophilicity tend to trap the drug in the plasma compartment resulting in a low Vd (3-5 L).
