Because the pancreatic and bile ducts join and enter the duodenum at the major duodenal papilla, #bilious emesis# suggests obstruction #distal# to this anatomic location.  Of the options, the only defect that could cause obstruction beyond this site is #annular pancreas,# a rare congenital anomaly that occurs when the ventral pancreatic bud fails to rotate completely in utero. $The ventral pancreatic bud is a foregut derivative that appears by the fifth week of gestation.  It normally rotates behind the duodenum and fuses with the dorsal pancreatic bud during the seventh to eight weeks.  The ventral pancreatic bud gives rise to the uncinate process of the pancreatic head and the main pancreatic duct (of Wirsung).  The pancreatic tail, body, and the remainder of head derive from the dorsal bud. $In patients with annular pancreas, #incomplete ventral bud rotation# results in pancreatic tissue surrounding the second part of the duodenum; the majority of patients with annular pancreas are asymptomatic.

Dietary proteins exist predominately as polypeptides; in order to be absorbed, they must be hydrolyzed to tripeptides, dipeptides, and amino acids.  Hydrolysis begins in the stomach with the activation of pepsin by hydrochloric acid; it continues in the proximal small intestine, catalyzed by the pancreatic enzymes trypsin, chymotrypsin, carboxypeptidase, and elastase. $Pancreatic enzymes, including trypsin, are secreted in their inactive forms.  #Enteropeptidase#, a duodenal brush border enzyme, is responsible for #activation of trypsin# from its inactive precursor, trypsinogen.  Once active, trypsin functions to cleave peptide bonds in dietary proteins and activate the other pancreatic enzymes.  Enteropeptidase #deficiency# leads to both #protein and fat malabsorption# as trypsin is required to activate enzymes required for both lipid and protein digestion.  The disease causes #diarrhea, failure to thrive, and edema# (due to hypoproteinemia). $#(Choice A)#  Amylase is produced by the salivary glands and pancreas; it catalyzes the hydrolysis of complex carbohydrates to simple sugars. $#(Choice B)#  Bile salts are formed through bile acid conjugation with amino acids glycine and taurine.  This increases their solubility, allowing them to aid in lipid digestion and absorption through the formation of micelles. $#(Choice C)#  Lactase is produced by the intestinal brush border and is responsible for the hydrolysis of lactose to glucose and galactose.  Lactase non-persistence commonly develops during mid-childhood, resulting in lactose intolerance. $#(Choice D)#  Chief cells of the stomach release the inactive form of pepsin, pepsinogen.  Exposure to hydrochloric acid in the stomach activates pepsin, initiating protein digestion. $#(Choice E)#  Secretin is a peptide hormone secreted by the S cells of the duodenum; it stimulates the secretion of bicarbonate from the pancreas and inhibits gastric acid secretion in the stomach.  Neutralization of the acidic pH of food entering the duodenum from the stomach is necessary for the proper function of pancreatic enzymes. $#Educational objective# The duodenal brush border enzyme enteropeptidase activates trypsin from its inactive precursor, trypsinogen.  Trypsin degrades complex polypeptides to dipeptides, tripeptides, and amino acids while activating other pancreatic enzymes.  Enteropeptidase deficiency impairs both protein and fat absorption, leading to diarrhea, failure to thrive, and hypoproteinemia.  "},
