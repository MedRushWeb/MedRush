Bacteria can access the spine by hematogenous spread from a distant infection (eg, skin or soft tissue, intravenous catheter), direct invasion from trauma or local spinal procedures (eg, lumbar puncture, spinal surgery), or direct spread from adjacent soft tissue infection.  #Hematogenous# spread is most common as the adult vertebral bone has a very rich and vascular marrow.  Increasing age can cause the nutrient arteries to develop a \"corkscrew\" anatomy, which allows bacteria to more easily penetrate the marrow cavity and cause local infection. $#Bacteremia# due to intravascular devices (eg, hemodialysis catheters) increases risk of health care-related vertebral osteomyelitis.  Offending organisms include #Staphylococcus# (most common is S aureus or coagulase-negative staphylococci) and various gram-negative organisms (eg, Pseudomonas).  Vertebral osteomyelitis should be suspected in patients with new or worsening back pain, fever, and recent endocarditis or bacteremia (especially S aureus).  It should also be suspected if there are new neurologic findings and fever, with or without back pain.  Initial evaluation includes #blood cultures# and #MRI# of the spine, which is the most sensitive imaging method for diagnosing vertebral osteomyelitis. $#(Choice A)#  Analgesics and close follow-up are recommended for musculoskeletal causes of low back pain, but this patient's clinical findings (fever, localized bony tenderness, recent bacteremia) are concerning for more serious etiologies and require further evaluation. $#(Choice B)#  CT myelogram, which can diagnose spinal stenosis or other vertebral pathology (including osteomyelitis), is performed by injecting contrast into the lumbar spine prior to CT imaging.  However, it is more invasive than MRI and usually reserved for patients who cannot undergo MRI (eg, those with pacemaker, metallic implants). $#(Choice C)#  Lumbar puncture is typically used for diagnosing meningitis and has a low yield for diagnosing vertebral osteomyelitis.  CT-guided bone biopsy is usually preferred for isolating the organism after imaging confirms the diagnosis of vertebral osteomyelitis. $#(Choice E)#  Serum protein electrophoresis is typically done to evaluate for monoclonal gammopathies (eg, multiple myeloma).  Although multiple myeloma can present with back pain, this patient's fever and recent bacteremia make vertebral osteomyelitis more likely. $#Educational objective# Vertebral osteomyelitis should be suspected in patients with new or worsening back pain, fever, and recent endocarditis or bacteremia (especially Staphylococcus aureus).

Older children often have focal bony tenderness, but children age â‰¤2 may be unable to localize pain.  Passive range of motion of the joints typically is normal and helps distinguish osteomyelitis from septic arthritis. $The most common cause of osteomyelitis in #children# is #hematogenous spread# of bacteria, which may be introduced by minor (often unnoticed) trauma to a distant site.  Infection in children classically occurs in the #metaphyses# of #long bones# (eg, femur, tibia) because this region is highly vascular yet contains #slow-flowing sinusoids# that are conducive to bacterial seeding.  Bacterial seeding within the metaphysis initially causes #acute inflammation# of the bone marrow, with focal hyperperfusion and #increased radiotracer uptake# within the affected region. $Persistent inflammation within the confined bony space leads to increased intramedullary pressure, which compromises blood flow and forces infectious exudate into the cortex and periosteum.  Without treatment, the infection can progress to chronic suppurative osteomyelitis, in which necrotic bone (ie, sequestrum) serves as an infectious reservoir and sinus tracts develop to drain away the purulent material. $#(Choice A)#  Osteomyelitis of flat bones (eg, skull, pelvis) is uncommon in children and is typically caused by contiguous spread of infection (eg, open wound, dental abscess).  Although pelvic bone involvement may lead to refusal to bear weight, this patient has no gross abnormality of the hips or lower extremities suggesting adjacent soft tissue infection. $#(Choice B)#  Ewing sarcoma typically arises in diaphysis of the long bones, especially the femur.  It is the second most common malignant bone tumor in children after osteosarcoma.  However, Ewing sarcoma typically presents in children age >10 with an insidious onset of progressive pain, not in toddlers with acute refusal to bear weight. $#(Choice C)#  The physis (growth plate) in children limits vascular connections between the metaphysis and epiphysis, which is relatively less vascularized, making epiphyseal involvement uncommon in hematogenous osteomyelitis.  Although avascular necrosis of the proximal femoral epiphysis (eg, Legg-Calve-Perthes) can present with a limp, the pain is typically more mild and develops gradually without fever. $#(Choice E)#  Hematogenous osteomyelitis in adults occurs more commonly in the vertebral bodies due to increasing vertebral vascularity with age as well as epiphyseal closure during puberty (improves capillary flow within the metaphyses of long bones). $#Educational objective# Hematogenous osteomyelitis occurs most commonly in children.  It usually affects the metaphysis of long bones due to the presence of slow-flowing sinusoids that are conducive to bacterial seeding.  Fever and refusal to bear weight are common manifestations in young children who are unable to localize the pain.  "},

The anterior portion of the #deltoid muscle# originates on the distal clavicle and inserts onto the humerus. Normally, this part of the muscle acts to abduct, flex, and medially rotate the humerus. However, in a distal clavicle fracture, deltoid muscle tone and the weight of the upper extremity act to pull the #distal fragment# in the #inferolateral# direction.

Although RA can cause joint pain, erythema, and restricted range of motion, joint involvement is more commonly symmetric and polyarticular (eg, â‰¥3 joints), with an insidious (vs acute) onset of symptoms. $#(Choice C)#  Serum ferritin levels are used in the diagnosis of hemochromatosis, which can cause arthritis due to iron deposition in the articular cartilage and synovium; however, the onset of joint pain is typically gradual (vs acute), and the hand metacarpophalangeal joints (particularly the second and third joints) are usually affected first. $#(Choice D)#  Synovial fluid crystal analysis, not a serum uric acid level, is the definitive test for gout because serum uric acid levels may be normal during an acute gout attack.  In addition, serum uric acid levels do not rule out other important causes of monoarthritis such as septic arthritis. $#Educational objective# Acute monoarthritis is characterized by pain, erythema, swelling, and reduced range of motion in a joint.

Factors associated with limited UV exposure and increased risk of vitamin D deficiency include the following: $â€¢ #Reduced time outdoors:#  elderly individuals, patients living in residential care or who are frequently hospitalized, people who avoid going outdoors due to high risk of skin cancer $â€¢ #Low UV sun exposure:#  individuals living at extreme northern or southern latitudes $â€¢ #Predominantly nocturnal lifestyle:#  shift work or occupations requiring overnight work $â€¢ #Blockade of sunlight exposure:#  people who use high-grade sunblock or wear full-coverage clothing $â€¢ #Reduced UV penetration:#  individuals with heavily pigmented skin $#(Choices B and C)#  The conversion of vitamin D2 and D3 to 25-hydroxycholecalciferol by 25-hydroxylase in the liver is primarily regulated by feedback inhibition from 25-hydroxycholecalciferol.  The conversion to 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol by 1-alpha-hydroxylase in the kidney is primarily regulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH) and plasma calcium levels.  Neither of these steps takes place in the skin or is affected by sunlight exposure. $#(Choices D and E)#  25-hydroxyvitamin D-24-hydroxylase converts 25- and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D into inactive 24-hydroxylated metabolites.  It is upregulated by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (to prevent excess vitamin D activity) and suppressed by parathyroid hormone (to facilitate replenishment of circulating calcium levels) and thus functions as a counter-regulatory homeostatic enzyme.  However, it is not affected by sunlight. $#Educational objective# Sunlight exposure catalyzes conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) in the skin.  Subsequent 25-hydroxylation in the liver and 1-hydroxylation in the kidneys produce 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, the active form.  Inadequate exposure to sunlight can lead to vitamin D deficiency.  "},

The asterisk corresponds to the #medial femoral condyle# (anterolateral surface), the proximal attachment site of the #posterior cruciate# ligament (@PCL@).  Distally, the PCL attaches to the posterior intercondylar area of the tibia. $The PCL #prevents posterior displacement of the tibia# relative to the femur when the knee is flexed.  Integrity of the PCL can be tested by flexing the knee to 90 degrees and pushing the tibia posteriorly (ie, @posterior drawer test@); excessive translation indicates a torn PCL. $The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) runs opposite the PCL within the knee joint and prevents anterior displacement of the tibia relative to the femur when the knee is flexed.  The ACL attaches proximally to the lateral femoral condyle (posteromedial surface) and distally to the anterior intercondylar area of the tibia #(choice A).#  Integrity of the ACL can be tested by flexing the knee to 90 degrees and pulling the tibia anteriorly (@anterior drawer test@). $#(Choice B)#  The lateral (fibular) collateral ligament attaches proximally to the lateral epicondyle of the femur and distally to the fibular head.  It provides lateral stability to the knee (resists varus force). $#(Choice C)#  The medial (tibial) collateral ligament (MCL) attaches proximally to the medial epicondyle of the femur and distally to the medial condyle of the tibia; it also attaches to the medial meniscus.  The MCL provides medial stability to the knee (resists valgus force). $#(Choice E)#  The transverse genicular ligament connects the anterior ends of the medial and lateral menisci.  It contributes little to the maintenance of knee joint stability. $#Educational objective# The posterior cruciate ligament attaches proximally to the medial femoral condyle (anterolateral surface) and distally to the posterior aspect of the intercondylar area of the tibia.  It prevents posterior displacement of the tibia relative to the femur when the knee is flexed.
