The resultant injuries are due to infants' unique anatomic features.  Infants have larger heads, enlarged subarachnoid spaces, higher brain water content, and decreased cervical muscle tone compared to older children.  These factors lead to increased movement of the immature brain in relation to the skull, shearing the #bridging cortical veins# that run between the dura and arachnoid mater (subdural space).  This can result in multiple @subdural hematomas@; because AHT may occur repeatedly over weeks to months, @acute on chronic@ subdural hemorrhages are often seen. $ The shaking motion also applies shearing forces at the interface between the vitreous and the retinal vessels (vitreoretinal traction), commonly causing #bilateral retinal hemorrhage#.

Patients complain of gradually worsening headache and display a slow decline in mental function.  On CT scan, subdural hematoma is seen as a #crescent-shaped# mass. $ Subdural hematoma often occurs in elderly individuals after a minor trauma.

A small volume change in any of the intracranial components (eg, brain tissue, blood, cerebrospinal fluid [CSF]) can produce significant changes in intracranial pressure (ICP).  Therefore, even small increases in cerebral blood volume can raise ICP and cause brain compression. $The main factors influencing cerebral circulation are systemic blood pressure and arterial blood gas levels.  When systemic blood pressure is 60-140 mm Hg, it has little effect on cerebral blood volume because autoregulation (via cerebral blood vessel dilation and contraction) keeps blood flow constant.  Blood pressure >150 mm Hg increases cerebral vascular volume and blood flow, causing a corresponding increase in ICP.  In contrast, blood pressure <50 mm Hg causes cerebral hypoperfusion and potential ischemia. $Arterial blood gases also have a powerful effect on cerebral blood flow, with PaCO2 being the most important regulator.

Induced sedation and therapeutic hypothermia can decrease brain metabolic demand, exerting a neuroprotective effect and improving ICP by reducing cerebral blood volume. $#(Choice B)#  The vasoconstriction induced by hyperventilation can cause a decrease in local cerebral perfusion that can worsen neurologic injury in patients with acute traumatic brain injury or stroke.  Therefore, hyperventilation should be used with caution in these patients, and the PaCO2 should be maintained ≥ 30 mm Hg. $#(Choice E)#  The thecal sac is a sheath of dura mater that contains CSF and surrounds the spinal cord.  Increased ICP can cause displacement of CSF from the brain into the thecal sac.  However, the drop in ICP caused by hyperventilation reduces CSF displacement. $#Educational objective# Carbon dioxide is a potent vasodilator of cerebral vasculature.  Tachypnea causes hypocapnia and cerebral vasoconstriction, thereby decreasing cerebral blood volume and intracranial pressure.  "}
