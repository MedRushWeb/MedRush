A very specific test has a low FP rate (important for confirmatory tests).  With a highly specific test, most healthy patients will have a negative test result (and a #p#ositive test result would help rule #in# the disease #[SpPIn#]). $The #cutoff value# of a quantitative diagnostic test determines whether a given result is interpreted as #positive or negative#.  Depending on the disease or condition being tested for, sensitivity or specificity may be preferred and the cutoff value adjusted accordingly.  A cutoff value just outside the overlapping region of the curves can maximize the sensitivity or specificity at 100% by correctly classifying all diseased or healthy individuals, respectively. $In the above example, changing the cutoff point to a #lower value# (shift to the left) would cause more patients with the disease to test positive (‚ÜëTP, ‚ÜìFN), #increasing the sensitivity# of the test.  However, as a consequence, more patients without the disease would also test positive (‚ÜìTN, ‚ÜëFP), resulting in #decreased specificity#. $#(Choices A, D, and E)#  Raising the cutoff value (shift to the right) would cause fewer individuals with the disease to have a positive test result (‚ÜìTP, ‚ÜëFN), so sensitivity would decrease.  Fewer individuals without the disease would also test positive (‚ÜëTN, ‚ÜìFP), so specificity would increase. $#(Choice B)#  Positive predictive value (PPV = TP / [TP + FP]) represents the probability that a patient with a positive test result actually has the disease.  In this case, the lower cutoff value would increase both TP and FP; how this affects the PPV depends on #disease prevalence#, which is not provided.  In a population with very low disease prevalence, the number of FP would be expected to increase proportionately more than the number of TP, which would lower the PPV. $#Educational objective# The cutoff value of a quantitative diagnostic test determines whether a given result is interpreted as positive or negative.  Lowering the cutoff point typically causes more patients with the disease to test positive, decreasing the number of false negatives and increasing test sensitivity.  Consequently, more patients without the disease will also test positive, resulting in an increased number of false positives and decreased specificity.  "

Observational studies can be subdivided as follows: $‚Ä¢ Descriptive studies collect data to characterize a specific health problem (eg, disease prevalence, incidence rates). $‚Ä¢ Analytical studies test hypotheses to evaluate associations between risk factors and disease. $A #case-control# study is an analytical observational design in which potential participants are initially identified as \"#cases#\" or \"#controls#\" according to an #outcome status# (ie, disease of interest).  In this example, children diagnosed with cognitive deficits are cases and children without cognitive deficits are controls.  Once identified, cases and controls are then #assessed retrospectively# for exposure to #risk factors# of interest.  In this case, the risk factor of interest is environmental lead exposure, as measured by the distance between the patients' residence and known lead-contaminated areas.  Finally, the prevalence of exposure to the risk factors (ie, frequency of exposure) is compared between cases and controls to estimate the #association# between the risk factors and the outcomes. $#(Choice B)#  A case series study is a descriptive study that tracks patients with a known condition (eg, exposure, risk factor, disease) to document the natural history or response to treatment.  Unlike a case-control study, a case series is purely descriptive and cannot establish associations. $#(Choice C)#  Cross-sectional studies may evaluate associations between risk factors and outcomes of interest.  However, unlike in case-control studies (participants selected based on the outcome status), the participants in a cross-sectional study are selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria set for the study. $#(Choice D)#  In cohort studies, 2 groups of individuals (ie, cohorts) are initially identified based on their exposure status to a specific risk factor (eg, environmental lead exposure) rather than based on their outcome status (eg, cognitive deficits), as seen in this example.  The cohorts are then followed over time for development of the outcome. $#(Choice E)#  A randomized clinical trial would follow individuals who have been randomized to either a treatment arm or a control arm and compare the effect of the intervention. $#Educational objective# A case-control study is an observational study design; it begins with selecting individuals who have the outcome (\"cases\") and individuals who do not have the outcome (\"controls\") and then retrospectively comparing their history of exposure to risk factors.

Assuming, as instructed, that the entire United States (US) population is at risk (reasonable theory given low number of hepatitis cases among the total population), then, in 1997 (US population ~275 million): $\u2003\u2003New HAV cases in 1997 = >10 new cases/100,000 population √ó 275,000,000 population = >27,500 $\u2003\u2003New HBV cases in 1997 = <5/100,000 √ó 275,000,000 = <13,750 $\u2003\u2003New HCV cases in 1997 = <3/100,000 √ó 275,000,000 = <8,250 $There were thousands more new HAV (>27,500) than HBV and HCV cases combined (<13,750 + <8,250 = <22,000).

Other laboratory analysis methods involve performing more specific calculations when it is important to detect a difference in one direction (eg, for a cancer marker, knowing that the value is significantly higher than normal is more important than knowing that it is significantly different‚Äîeither higher or lower‚Äîthan normal).  In some cases, high-sensitivity assays (eg, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein testing) allow the detection of values in the lower range of normal, which would not have been possible with standard assays. $#Educational objective# In a normal (bell-shaped) distribution, 68% of all values are within 1 standard deviation (SD) from the mean; 95% are within 2 SD from the mean; and 99.7% are within 3 SD from the mean.

After the initial 4-week treatment period and the 1-week washout phase, the #treatments are switched# and delivered for an additional 4 weeks.  This is consistent with a #crossover study#, in which subjects are randomly allocated to a sequence of 2 or more treatments given consecutively.  The simplest model is the AB/BA type of study in which half of the subjects are allocated to the AB study arm and receive treatment A followed by treatment B, while the other half of the subjects are allocated to the BA study arm and receive the same treatments but in reverse order.  In this way, crossover trials allow the patients to serve as their #own controls#. $The principal drawback of crossover trials is that the effects of one treatment may #carry over# and alter the response to a subsequent treatment.  To avoid this, a #washout phase# (no treatment) is often added between treatments.  The washout period is designed to be long enough to allow the effects of prior treatment to wear off. $#(Choice A)#  A case-control study is designed by selecting patients with a particular disease (cases) and without that disease (controls), then determining their past exposure status to >= 1 risk factors believed to be associated with the disease of interest. $#(Choice B)#  A case series is a descriptive study that tracks patients with a known condition (eg, a particular exposure, risk factor, or disease) to document the natural history or response to treatment.  Unlike a case-control study, a case series is a descriptive study that cannot quantify statistical significance. $#(Choice D)#  A cross-sectional study is also known as a prevalence study.  It is characterized by the simultaneous measurement of exposure and outcome.  It is a snapshot study design that frequently uses surveys.  These studies are relatively inexpensive and easy to perform. $#(Choices E and F)#  Prospective cohort studies identify 2 groups of individuals (ie, cohorts), based on their exposure status to a risk factor.  These 2 cohorts are then followed over time to assess development of the disease of interest.  Sometimes the exposure status is determined retrospectively, typically using medical records, and patients are tracked from the point of exposure onward. $#Educational objective# In a crossover study, subjects are randomly allocated to a sequence of 2 or more treatments given consecutively.

It is calculated using the following formula: $‚Ä¢ RR = [a/(a + b)] / [c/(c + d)] = (20/90) / (30/70) $RR often has more clinical utility than the OR since it gives the change in disease risk based on the presence or absence of risk factors.  However, RR cannot be calculated in case-control studies as patients are preselected based on disease status (cases and controls) instead of being sorted into exposure groups and followed over time to assess disease outcomes. $#Educational objective# The odds ratio (OR) is a measure of the strength of an association between an exposure and an outcome.  Specifically, it represents the odds that an outcome occurred in the presence of a particular exposure compared with the odds that the outcome occurred in the absence of that exposure.

In general, when bias is present, the #results are consistently distorted# in one direction.  In prospective studies, if #loss to follow-up occurs disproportionately# between the exposed and unexposed groups, #attrition bias# can result if the lost subjects differ in their risk of developing the outcome compared to the remaining subjects.  Attrition bias is a# form of selection bias# (a term that most often refers to systematic differences between groups in terms of treatment response or prognosis).  Attrition bias does not occur when the losses happen randomly between the exposed and unexposed groups, as this simply leads to a smaller study population. $In this example, a substantial number of subjects (800 / 4000 = 20%) were lost to follow-up, primarily those with higher levels of alcohol consumption.  If these lost subjects had a higher incidence of breast cancer than those remaining in the study, then a selective loss of high-risk subjects would have occurred in the exposed group.  As a result, the measure of the association between alcohol use and breast cancer would be underestimated, which might explain why no significant association was seen in this study (as the confidence interval of 0.90 to 1.85 crosses 1, which is the null value for relative risk). $#(Choice A)#  Lead-time bias occurs when a screening test diagnoses a disease earlier than it would have appeared by natural history alone, so that the time from diagnosis until death appears prolonged even though there might actually be no improvement in survival. $#(Choice B)#  Observer bias can occur in clinical trials when study participants or investigators are aware of individual treatment assignments.  It can be prevented by performing a double-blind study in which neither participants nor investigators are aware of treatment assignments. $#(Choice C)#  Misclassification bias occurs when either the exposure or the outcome is not identified correctly.  Random (or nondifferential) misclassification affects all groups to the same extent.  For example, if a pediatric size sphygmomanometer cuff is used on all participants (treatment and control groups) as part of a study in adult patients, the blood pressure readings will be incorrect (due to the incorrect cuff size).  However, the resulting misclassification will likely affect both groups to the same extent (because the same cuff was used). $#(Choice D)#  Recall bias results from the inaccurate recall of past exposure status.  It is a potential problem for retrospective studies such as case-control studies, particularly when questionnaires are used to inquire about distant past exposure.  However, in this prospective study, exposure status is determined through periodic questionnaires assessing daily alcohol consumption (without inquiring about distant past exposure).  In such a scenario, recall bias is less likely to affect results. $#Educational objective# In prospective studies, disproportionate loss to follow-up between the exposed and unexposed groups creates the potential for attrition bias, which is a form of selection bias.  As a result, investigators generally try to achieve high patient follow-up rates in prospective studies. "

In this scenario, smoking status modified the effect of the new estrogen receptor agonist (exposure) on deep vein thrombosis (DVT) incidence (outcome).  Using stratified analysis by smoking status: $‚Ä¢ Among smokers, there was a statistically significant association between taking the new estrogen receptor agonist and risk of developing DVT with a relative risk of >1, indicating higher risk, and a p-value of <0.05, indicating statistical significance. $‚Ä¢ In contrast, among nonsmokers, there was no statistically significant association between taking the medication and risk of DVT (p-value >0.05). $Effect modification is not a bias #(choices D and E)#, as it is not due to flaws in the design or analysis phases of the study.

Children with bigger shoe sizes may appear to be more intelligent on initial analysis.  However, this association is likely not due to shoe size but rather to age because older children tend to have both bigger feet and more intelligence.  When older and younger children are analyzed separately (stratification based on the confounder), the association between shoe size and intelligence disappears. $#(Choice C)#  The latent period is the time required for an exposure to begin having an effect.  However, there is no information on how latency was handled in this study. $#Educational objective# Effect modification is present when the effect of the main exposure on the outcome is modified by the presence of another variable.

In this case, #improved quality of care# likely led to a lower mortality rate in diabetics over time, resulting in a higher prevalence of the disease in the population #(choice B)#. $#(Choice A)#  A decreased hospitalization rate would indicate reduced morbidity (ie, burden of disease) among diabetic individuals.  However, a decrease in hospitalization rate would not necessarily be associated with reduced mortality and increasing disease prevalence. $#(Choice D)#  Increased accuracy of diagnostic testing would affect both the prevalence and incidence of a disease as it changes the rate at which new cases are detected. $#(Choice E)#  Increased exposure to diabetes risk factors would likely increase both disease incidence and prevalence. $#(Choice G)#  Selective survival bias occurs in case-control studies when cases are selected from the entire disease population instead of from just those that are newly diagnosed.  For instance, a study on cancer survival that is not limited to newly diagnosed patients could contain a higher proportion of relatively benign malignancies, as these patients generally live longer. $#Educational objective# Prevalence equals the incidence rate multiplied by the average disease duration.  Changing disease prevalence in a steady-state population with a constant incidence rate means that there is an additional factor affecting the duration of the condition.  A factor that prolongs disease duration (eg, improved quality of care) will increase disease prevalence, as affected patients survive longer. ",

The cross-sectional study has a \"#snapshot#\" design that is frequently used in surveys, mostly because it is inexpensive and easy to perform.  In this example, a snapshot was obtained of individuals randomly selected from the population; their blood samples were analyzed for the presence of the sodium channel protein mutation and the prevalence of hypertension was calculated.  The subjects' blood pressure was measured over 7 days to obtain an average measurement (likely to limit the results being impacted by white-coat hypertension and other transient causes of hypertension).  The major limitation of a cross-sectional study design is that a temporal relationship between exposure and outcome is not always clear.  However, in this case, demonstrating a temporal relationship was straightforward because the possession of a specific genotype clearly precedes hypertension. $#(Choice A)#  A case-control study is designed by selecting individuals with a particular disease (cases), individuals without that disease (controls), and then evaluating previous exposure status.  This study would have been classified as a case-control study if it had explicitly recruited individuals with (cases) and without (controls) hypertension (rather than randomly selecting a sample from a population) and evaluated their sodium channel mutation patterns. $#(Choices C and E)#  A prospective cohort study would have taken individuals without hypertension from the population, analyzed their blood samples to determine the distribution of the sodium channel mutation, and followed them over time (years) to determine the proportion of new cases of hypertension in patients with and without the mutation.  In this example, although hypertension was measured over several days, the objective was not to document incidence of new cases of hypertension (which would be unlikely to develop over 1 week) but to measure the prevalence of hypertension while ensuring that average blood pressure measurements were obtained. $A retrospective design would have also assessed incidence (not prevalence) of hypertension compared to an earlier period of time, based on a chart review of historic data.  Prospective and retrospective cohort studies are organized by selecting a group of individuals (ie, a cohort) who do #not# have the disease of interest (eg, hypertension), determining their exposure status, and then following them (forward in time or from a point in the past to the present) to assess for the development of the disease. $#(Choice D)#  A randomized clinical trial directly compares @>@2 treatments.  Usually, the subjects are randomly assigned to experience a specific exposure (eg, a medication) or no exposure (eg, placebo) and are then followed to assess for the outcome of interest (eg, disease). $#Educational objective# In a cross-sectional study, exposure and outcome are measured simultaneously at a particular point in time (\"snapshot study\").

  "explanation_2": "#Antioxidant use# for #‚â•5 years# was associated with a #statistically significant# (p < 0.01) decreased risk of stroke (relative risk [RR] = 0.75 <1).  By contrast, antioxidant use for #<5 years# demonstrated a #nonstatistically significant# (p > 0.05) smaller reduction in risk (RR = 0.95); in other words, antioxidant use for <5 years seems to have no benefit on stroke risk reduction.  This discrepancy can be explained if reduction in stroke risk is associated with the #duration of exposure# to antioxidant supplementation; in other words, a minimum cumulative exposure to antioxidants may be necessary for the exposure to have a significant effect on stroke risk. $This concept of #accumulation effect# can apply to both risk factors and risk reducers.  The effect of exposure to risk factors may depend on the duration and intensity of the exposure; long-term exposure may be necessary well before an effect on the disease process is clinically evident (eg, lung cancer developing after decades of smoking exposure).  Similarly, exposure to certain #risk reducers# must occur continuously over extended periods before disease outcome is affected.  In this case, ‚â•5 years of continuous antioxidant use (risk reducer) were required to reveal their protective effect on stroke. $#(Choice B)#  Lead time is the time between the initial detection of a disease and a specific outcome or measured endpoint.  @Lead-time bias@ can occur when a test detects or diagnoses the disease at an earlier stage than another test without impacting the natural history of the disease.  A study comparing disease survival times may then erroneously conclude that using the earlier-detection test prolongs survival, when in actuality the increased survival time is due solely to earlier detection of the disease. $#(Choice C)#  Observer bias occurs when an observer misclassifies data due to individual differences in interpretation or preconceived expectations regarding a study.  It can be reduced by performing a double-blind study (ie, both observers and participants unaware of randomized parameters) and by having multiple observers encode and verify the recorded data. $#(Choice D)#  Diseases with a very low incidence rate in the population will also have a very low prevalence.  According to the rare disease assumption, the @odds ratio approximates RR@ when disease prevalence is low (eg, <10%). $#(Choice E)#  Selection bias can occur with inappropriate (ie, nonrandom) selection methods or through selective attrition of the study participants.  Although selection bias is a possible limitation of the study (eg, individuals who take vitamins daily may be more likely to be already healthy), the fact that the study was limited to healthy, physically active men and that it adjusted for baseline differences should considerably reduce the effect of this potential bias. $#Educational objective# The concept of accumulation effect can be applied to disease pathogenesis and exposure to risk modifiers.  Cumulative exposure to a risk factor or risk reducer must sometimes occur for prolonged periods before a clinically significant effect is detected. ",

The SD is a measure of dispersion or variance (how far the measurements are from one another).  In this example, the mean folate level is 5.0 ng/mL with a SD of 0.5 ng/mL.  Therefore: $‚Ä¢  4.5-5.5 ng/mL is the range within +/- 1 SD of 5.0 ng/mL (given that 5.0 ‚Äì 1*0.5 = 4.5 ng/mL and 5 + 1*0.5 = 5.5 ng/mL); $‚Ä¢  4.0-6.0 ng/mL is the range within +/- 2 SDs of 5.0 ng/mL (given that 5.0 ‚Äì 2*0.5 = 4.0 ng/mL and 5.0 + 2*0.5 = 6.0 ng/mL) $‚Ä¢ 3.5-6.5 ng/mL is the range within +/- 3 SDs of 5.0 ng/mL (given that 5.0 ‚Äì 3*0.5 = 3.5 ng/mL and 5.0 + 3*0.5 = 6.5 ng/mL) $Based on the 68/95/99 rule, approximately 95% of observations lie within 2 SDs of the mean, so between 4.0 and 6.0 ng/mL in this case.  These are helpful approximations; to be more precise, 95% of the observations lie within 1.96 SDs of the mean and 95.45% of the observations lie within 2 SDs of the mean. $Note that SD is used to describe individual observations in a dataset.  A closely related measure called standard error (SE) is used to show how closely sample means are related to population means; SE = SD / ‚àön, where n is the sample size.  In this example, if SE had been given instead of SD, investigators would be 95% confident that the true mean folate level in the underlying population lies within the mean +/- 2 SE (which is also the range that would include 95% of sample means calculated from repeated samples of the same size taken from that population). $#(Choices A and D)#  These limits are asymmetric and are therefore inconsistent with a normal distribution curve around the mean. $#(Choice B)#  Approximately 99.7% of all observations lie within 3 SDs of the mean (3.5-6.5 ng/mL). $#(Choice E)#  Approximately 68% of all observations lie within 1 SD of the mean (4.5-5.5 ng/mL). $#Educational objective# In a normal (bell-shaped) distribution curve, 68% of observations lie within 1 standard deviation (SD) of the mean, 95% of observations lie within 2 SDs of the mean, and 99.7% of observations lie within 3 SDs of the mean.

  "explanation_2": "#Observer bias# (also known as expectancy bias) occurs when investigators #misclassify data# due to preconceived expectations or #prior knowledge# concerning the study or its participants.  This type of bias is particularly important when outcomes are #subjective# (ie, involve personal interpretation of clinical, microscopic, or radiographic findings). $In this case, the pathologists who work at the hospital where the study is being conducted may know that the study is investigating diabetic nephropathy, or they may have access to additional medical records that indicate diabetes status.  Conversely, the pathologists at other institutions are more likely to be blinded to the study's objectives and the patients' medical history. $#(Choice A)#  A confounder is an extraneous variable that is related to the exposure under investigation but that is also an independent risk factor for a disease.  Confounding distorts the relationship between the exposure and the disease.  For example, fatty food intake is a potential confounder in a study evaluating the association between physical activity and obesity, as people who do not exercise regularly may be more likely to consume a high-fat diet. $#(Choice B)#  @Lead-time bias@ refers to the apparent prolongation of survival in patients who undergo a screening test that allows for earlier diagnosis but does not actually improve prognosis.  For example, a patient with pancreatic cancer presents with metastases at age 58 for which he receives treatment, but he dies at age 60.  Had the same patient been screened and diagnosed with pancreatic cancer at age 55, he would have received earlier treatment, but the disease could have progressed such that he would have still died at age 60 (ie, age at death would not have been affected by screening). $#(Choice D)#  Recall bias results from inaccurate recall of past exposure by people in a study; it applies most often to retrospective designs such as case-control studies.  People who have experienced an adverse outcome are more likely to recall previous risk factors than people who have not experienced an adverse outcome. $#(Choice E)#  Selection bias can occur with inappropriate (ie, nonrandom) selection methods or through selective attrition of the study participants.  For example, many patients drop from a clinical trial due to the severity of side effects associated with the treatment.  This type of attrition is selective (ie, different attrition rates between groups) and reduces the generalizability of the study. $#Educational objective# Observer bias occurs when the investigator's evaluation is affected by preconceived expectations or prior knowledge, typically leading to overestimation of the disease association or treatment effects.  This type of bias can be reduced by conducting a blinded study in which observers are unaware of study details and patient characteristics that could unduly influence them. ",

Specifically, it tests the #null hypothesis# that all groups are simply random samples of the same population (ie, the #means are the same#).  The null hypothesis is rejected when there are at least 2 group means that are significantly different from one another. $ANOVA can be used to compare ‚â•2 groups but is generally used to compare #‚â•3 groups# (because other equivalent methods exist to compare 2 groups).  For example, the 2 independent samples t-test is a special case of the F-test in ANOVA.  The assumptions for both tests and their resulting p-values are the same. $#(Choice B)#  Chi-square tests can be used to evaluate the association between 2 categorical variables.  For example, if FEV1 is measured as a categorical variable (eg, normal or low), then a chi-square test could be used to determine if there is an association between FEV1 and smoking status.  However, this study is specifically comparing the mean FEV1 results (a quantitative variable) between groups. $#(Choice C)#  Meta-analysis involves the pooling of data from several studies to perform an analysis with greater statistical power than the individual studies alone.  For example, individual studies assessing the effects of aspirin on certain cardiovascular events may be inconclusive.  However, analysis of data compiled from multiple clinical trials may reveal a significant benefit. $#(Choice D)#  Multiple logistic regression is a method used to predict the probability of a binary outcome (eg, presence or absence of gastric cancer) based on 1 or more independent variables that can be either continuous or categorical.  For example, this test could be used to predict the probability of gastric cancer based on alcohol consumption, tobacco use, and charred food consumption. $#(Choice E)#  The Pearson correlation coefficient is a measure of the strength and direction of a linear relationship between 2 quantitative (ie, continuous) variables.  For example, a study may report a correlation coefficient describing the association between hemoglobin A1c levels and average blood glucose levels. $#(Choice F)#  A two-sample t-test can be used when 2 group means are compared.  This test could have been used for the example in the question if the study participants were divided into smoking and nonsmoking groups only (ie, 2 groups instead of 4). $#Educational objective# A t-test is used to compare the difference between the means of 2 groups.  Analysis of variance (ANOVA) compares the difference between the means of 2 or more groups.

This study is double-blinded, thereby minimizing potential ascertainment bias. $#(Choice B)#  Confounding distorts the relationship between exposures (eg, treatments) and the outcome (eg, disease) of interest, and can wholly or partially account for observed effects.  This study is a randomized trial, thereby minimizing potential confounding bias by generating groups that are comparable with respect to known and unknown confounding variables. $#(Choice C)#  Ecological fallacy occurs when conclusions are made about individuals based on studies where the unit of analysis is a group (ie, the conclusions of a study assessing population groups do not necessarily apply to individuals).  In this study, the unit of analysis is the individual, not the group. $#(Choice E)#  Recall bias results from the inaccurate recollection of past exposure status.  It is a potential problem for case-control studies, particularly when questionnaires are used to inquire about distant past exposure.  However, this study is an experiment in which patients are exposed to treatments and then assessed for the outcome. $#Educational objective# An inappropriately small sample will fail to identify important clinically significant differences as statistically significant because of a lack of sufficient statistical power.

An outlier can affect measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) as well as measures of dispersion (standard deviation, variance). $This patient had 20 initial measurements that were all between 10 and 12 mm Hg.  Although it is not required to answer this question correctly, a numerical example can help to explain the effect of an outlier such as 26 mm Hg.  Assume that the patient's 20 initial measurements were: 9 measurements of 10 mm Hg, 6 measurements of 11 mm Hg, and 5 measurements of 12 mm Hg.

Initially a group of subjects is selected (i.e., cohort) and their exposure status is determined (smoker/non-smoker).  The cohort is then followed for a certain period of time and observed for development of the outcome (breast cancer).  Sometimes, the exposure status is determined retrospectively and then patients are tracked from that point of time, typically using medical records #(choice B)#. $#(Choice C) #A case-control study is designed by selecting patients with a particular disease (cases) and without that disease (controls) and then determining their previous exposure status. $#(Choice D)# A cross-sectional study is also known as a prevalence study.  It is characterized by the simultaneous measurement of exposure and outcome.  It is a snapshot study design that frequently uses surveys.  They are relatively inexpensive and easy to perform. $#(Choice E) #A randomized clinical trial directly compares two or more treatments.  Usually, the subjects are randomly assigned to an exposure (e.g., a medication) or placebo and then followed for the development of the outcome of interest. $#Educational objective #Prospective cohort studies are organized by selecting a group of individuals (i.e., cohort), determining their exposure status, and then following them over time for development of the disease of interest.

It can be calculated from study data as follows: $\u2003\u2003\u2003NPV = number of true negatives / total number of negative tests $To determine the NPV in this case, it helps to summarize the results of the efficacy study in a @2 √ó 2 table@.  The study evaluated 200 individuals in a population with a 50% prevalence of dementia (ie, 100 patients had dementia while 100 did not).  Knowing that specificity (ie, true negatives/total disease negatives) and sensitivity (ie, true positives/total disease positives) are 80% and 90%, respectively, the following 2 √ó 2 table can be created: ",
  "explanation_2": "$The NPV can now be estimated as follows: $\u2003\u2003NPV = number of true negatives (d) / total number of negative tests (c + d) $\u2003\u2003\u2003NPV = d / (c + d) = 80 / (10 + 80) = 0.889 = ~ #89%# $Unlike sensitivity and specificity, positive and negative predictive values vary based on the prevalence of the disease.  In fact, the NPV is inversely proportional to the prevalence of a disease (eg, NPV ‚Üì as disease prevalence ‚Üë).  For the NPV to be applicable to an individual patient, that patient's #pretest probability# (eg, probability of having the disease before testing) must be #similar# to the #prevalence of disease# in the population where the study was conducted.  The question says to assume that the patient's pretest probability is equivalent to the disease prevalence in the study population, so the NPV calculated in the study is generalizable to this patient. $#Educational objective# Negative predictive value (NPV) represents the probability of not having a disease given a negative test result.  NPV is inversely proportional to the prevalence of a disease.  When a patient has characteristics similar to the overall population (eg, age, sex, risk factor status), the disease prevalence is a valid estimate of the pretest probability of disease.",

  "explanation_2": "$A measurement tool should be precise and accurate to be useful in the clinical setting.  Precision and accuracy are defined as follows: $‚Ä¢ #Precision# (reliability) is the ability of a test to reproduce identical or similar results with repeated measurements (bottom half of figure). $‚Ä¢ #Accuracy# (validity) is the ability of a test to measure what it is supposed to measure.  For a new test to be accurate, its results should be equivalent to the results obtained with a \"gold standard\" (eg, best conventional test available) on the same individual (right half of figure). $A precise test gives similar or very close results on repeat measurements.  In this example, repeat measurements of the same sample yielded different results; therefore, the new test has low precision. $#(Choices A and E)#  To evaluate the accuracy of a new test, its results should be compared to those obtained with the gold standard test on the same individual.  A test can be highly precise (ie, gives very similar results on repeat measurements) but inaccurate (ie, the measurements are all incorrect compared to the gold standard).  A test that is highly imprecise is also highly inaccurate.  In this case, as there were no test results obtained using the \"gold standard\", the accuracy/validity of the test cannot be determined. $#(Choices C and D)#  Sensitivity is defined as a test's ability to identify the true presence of disease, whereas specificity is defined as a test's ability to identify the true absence of disease.  Poor reliability can limit the sensitivity or specificity of a test if the results from healthy and diseased populations are close in value. $#Educational objective# A precise/reliable test is reproducible in that it gives similar results on repeat measurements.  Reliability is maximal when random error is minimal. "

In this example, the event of interest is myocardial infarction.  There were 25 + 975 = 1,000 patients in the control group; of those, 25 had a myocardial infarction.  Similarly, there were 10 + 990 = 1,000 patients in the treatment (ie, Superstatin) group; of those, 10 had a myocardial infarction.

A #low NNT# implies that a treatment is #more beneficial# because fewer patients need to be treated to prevent an additional negative outcome.  For instance, if a third hypolipidemic medication had an NNT of 40, it would be more beneficial than Superstatin, as only 40 patients would need to be treated over a given period to prevent an additional myocardial infarction. $#Educational objective# The number needed to treat (NNT) is the number of patients that need to be treated with a medication to avoid an additional negative outcome.

  "explanation_2": "#Recall bias# results from study participants' #inaccurate recall# of past exposure and occurs most often in #retrospective# studies such as #case-control# studies.  People who have experienced an adverse event (eg, congenital abnormalities in their children) are more likely to recall previous potential risk factors (eg, acetaminophen use) than people who have not experienced an adverse event. $Contrary to case-control studies, which evaluate exposure to potential risk factors retrospectively, #prospective studies# begin with exposed and unexposed individuals.  Because the exposure status is determined at the time of enrollment in the study, recall bias is #minimized#. $#(Choice A)#  Allocation bias can result from the way patients are assigned to the treatment and control groups.  It may occur when subjects are nonrandomly assigned to the study groups of a clinical trial (eg, physicians may preferentially enroll sicker patients into the experimental group).  Allocation bias is different from selection bias, which occurs when the studied sample does not represent the general population (eg, because of nonrandom selection). $#(Choice B)#  Detection bias refers to the fact that a risk factor itself may lead to extensive diagnostic investigation and increase the probability that a disease is identified.  For instance, patients who smoke may undergo increased imaging surveillance due to their smoking status, which would detect more cases of cancer in general. $#(Choice D)#  Referral (admission rate) bias occurs when the case and control populations differ due to admission or referral practices.  For instance, a study involving asbestos as a risk factor for lung cancer conducted at a hospital specializing in treating asbestosis may select patients with lung cancer (cases) from the respiratory department and a control group without lung cancer from other departments.  Because the hospital specializes in asbestosis treatment, patients in the respiratory department with lung cancer are more likely to have a history of asbestos exposure (compared to patients with lung cancer at other, nonspecialized institutions).  Therefore, the study may erroneously report a stronger association than actually exists. $#(Choice E)#  Selection bias occurs when the method of selection used in a particular study results in selection sample of participants who are not representative of the intended population.  A common example is patients with cancer who fail standard therapy and who are therefore the most likely to enroll in experimental trials (self-selection), leading to results that are not applicable to patients with less advanced cancers. $#Educational objective# Recall bias results from study participants' inaccurate recall of past exposure and occurs most often in retrospective studies such as case-control studies.  People who have experienced an adverse event are more likely to recall risk factors than those who have not experienced an adverse event. "

  "explanation_2": "The #normal distribution# is a continuous distribution that follows a bell-shaped curve with a single peak at the mean value.  One of the most important properties of the normal distribution is its #symmetry# about its mean, which allows for determination of the percentage of all observations that lie within 1, 2, or 3 standard deviations (SDs).  The @\"68/95/99 rule\"@ states that 68% of all observations lie within 1 SD of the mean, 95% within 2 SDs of the mean, and 99.7% within 3 SDs of the mean.  These are helpful approximations; however, when considering the normal distribution, exactly #95% of the observations# lie within #1.96 SDs# of the mean and 99% of the observations lie within 2.58 SDs (1.96 and 2.58 represent z-scores for 95% and 99% of the distribution, respectively). $Most research is done using #samples# rather than entire populations.  This introduces some variability when calculating population parameters such as mean value (eg, when different samples are drawn from the same population, the means from all possible samples will often be slightly different).  The #variability between sample means# can be calculated in a way analogous to calculating the SD of a group of observations in a single sample.  The \"standard deviation\" of a series of sample means is known as the #standard error# (#SE#) of the mean, and it estimates how far the sample mean is likely to be from the unknown population mean.  The SE is estimated considering both the SD and the size of the sample (n) in the following manner:  #SD/‚àön#. $A sample mean is a point estimate of the true population mean; however, a #confidence interval# (#CI#) better accounts for the variability due to sampling by including the SE in its calculation.  The CI of the mean can be calculated as follows: $\u2003\u2003\u2003 CI of mean = mean ¬± [z-score for confidence level] √ó [SE] $where the z-score for confidence level represents the number of SEs containing the desired percentage of observations around the mean (eg, 95%, 99%).  In this case, the 95% CI can be calculated: $\u2003\u2003\u2003 CI of mean = #mean ¬± 1.96 √ó (SD/‚àön)# $The sample size and the SD of the sample determine the magnitude of the variability due to sampling.  As n increases, SE decreases, and the CI becomes narrower and more precise.  Conversely, as the SD increases, SE increases, and the CI becomes wider and less precise. $#(Choice A)#  CI estimates use the SE of the mean, which takes into account the SD and the size of the sample (n).  As such, the equation divides the SD by the square root of n. $#(Choices C, D, and E)#  As noted, the SD reflects the spread of individual values in a normal distribution.  Multiplying the SD by a specific constant (z-score) gives us a range of values that encompass a certain proportion of the observations.  The mean ¬± 1 √ó SD would cover 68% of the observations, and the mean ¬± 2.58 √ó SD would cover 99% of the observations.  However, the question is asking for a 95% CI, so the equation should use a z-score of 1.96 and the SE (ie, SD/‚àön). $#Educational objective# The standard deviation reflects the spread of individual values in a normal distribution (ie, it measures the variability of the observations within a single sample).  The standard error of the mean reflects the variability of means (ie, variance between the means of different samples) and helps estimate the true mean of the underlying population. ",

Choosing the correct statistical test always depends on the type of dependent and independent variables under consideration. $The #chi-square test# for independence (also known as chi-square test for association) is used to evaluate the association between #2 categorical variables#.  In this example, patients are divided into 2 groups based on serum #fibrinogen levels# (dependent categorical variable: #normal# [200-400 mg/dL],# high# [>400 mg/dL]) and then divided again based on #simvastatin exposure# status (independent categorical variable: #treated#,# not treated#), with the data recorded in a 2 √ó 2 table.  A chi-square test may be conducted to determine whether a statistically significant association exists between simvastatin use and the high levels of serum fibrinogen.  A large difference in the frequency of simvastatin use between cases and controls is indicative of an association between simvastatin use and high levels of fibrinogen (ie, the null hypothesis is rejected). $#(Choices A and E)#  The analysis of variance (ANOVA) and two-sample t-test are used to compare the means between groups.  This would require the dependent variable (ie, outcome) to be a quantitative variable.  The difference between these 2 tests resides in the number of groups compared.  The t-test is used to compare 2 group means, whereas the ANOVA is used to compare ‚â•2 group means.  Either of these tests would be appropriate in this example if fibrinogen levels were recorded as a quantitative variable (ie, the actual measured level in mg/dL) instead of a categorical variable (ie, normal or high). $#(Choice C)#  The correlation coefficient is a measure of the strength and direction of a linear relationship between 2 quantitative variables.  For example, a study may report a correlation coefficient describing the association between hemoglobin A1c levels and average blood glucose levels. $#(Choice D)#  Meta-analysis is an epidemiological method of pooling the data from several studies to conduct an analysis having a relatively larger statistical power than that of the individual studies. $#Educational objective# A 2 √ó 2 table is normally used to record the presence or absence of exposure and disease in research.

The best way to account for the effects of these variables is to randomly assign subjects to experimental groups.  Afterward, the groups are analyzed to ensure that they are statistically similar in underlying variables, with the results often reported in a baseline characteristics table (eg, weight, sex, age). $Therefore, randomization increases the likelihood that any #difference observed between groups is due exclusively to the treatment# and not to other characteristics. $#(Choices A and B)#  A blind study is a type of clinical trial in which either the participants or the researchers (ie, single blind) or both the participants and the researchers (ie, double blind) are unaware of treatment assignments.

However, if the parameter of interest is a #difference #(eg, difference in mean SBP between cocoa intake and control groups), then the #null value is 0# because that represents no difference between the groups. $In this case, the 95% CI of [‚àí2.7, ‚àí1.3] does not include the null value of 0 and therefore the result is #statistically significant#.  In summary, cocoa intake was associated with a statistically significant decrease in SBP. $#(Choices A and E)#  The overall mean change in SBP was negative at ‚àí2.2 mm Hg, reflecting a lower SBP in the cocoa group compared to the control group.  The change was statistically significant. $#(Choice B)#  Although there was a statistically significant decrease in SBP in the cocoa intake group, the clinical significance may be limited as the absolute SBP decrease is only about 2 mm Hg.  Furthermore, the trials measured SBP at 2 weeks, so it is possible that the effect of cocoa intake on SBP was short-lived.  Finally, no information is provided regarding adverse effects of cocoa intake. $#(Choice D)#  Given that the CI crossed the null value in studies 2 and 7, there was no statistically significant difference between the groups in these studies. $#Educational objective# A meta-analysis groups results of several trials to increase statistical power and provide an overall pooled effect estimate.

An example is shown in the @exhibit@.  In a primary school, it may appear on crude analysis that students with bigger shoe sizes have a higher level of intelligence.  However, this association is actually a result of age, not shoe size: Older students tend to have bigger shoe sizes and also to be more intelligent.  Age is a confounder because it is associated with both shoe size and intelligence and muddles the association between them.  When study subjects are grouped by age (#stratification#), the association between shoe size and intelligence is no longer significant. $Similarly, initial crude analysis suggested that alcohol use was associated with bladder carcinoma (similar to shoe size being associated with intelligence), with a relative risk (RR) of 1.81 and a p-value <0.05.  However, smoking is associated with both bladder carcinoma and alcohol use.  Therefore, #smoking# is a potential confounder that may explain the association observed between alcohol use and bladder cancer (similar to age in the school example).  Stratified analysis by smoking status shows that both smokers and non-smokers have an RR ~1 with large p-values (>0.05).  The RR of 1.81 found on crude analysis disappears and there is no true association between alcohol consumption and bladder cancer. $#(Choice B)#  #Effect modification# results when an external variable positively or negatively impacts the observed effect of a risk factor on disease status.  When analysis is performed based on stratification by this external variable, there will be a significant difference in risk between the stratified groups.

Effect modification can easily be confused with confounding; but stratified analysis can help distinguish between them.  With confounding, there is usually no significant difference between the strata (as in this case with the smoker and non-smoker strata). $#(Choices C and E)#  Measurement bias and observer bias distort the strength of association by misclassifying exposed/unexposed and/or diseased/nondiseased subjects.  The scenario does not describe any issues that could affect the classification process. $#(Choice D)#  Meta-analysis refers to compiling results from several studies to increase analysis power. $#(Choice F)#  Recall bias results from inaccurate recall of past exposure by people in the study and applies mostly to retrospective (eg, case-control) studies. $#Educational objective# Confounding occurs when the exposure-disease relationship is muddled by the effect of an extraneous factor associated with both exposure and disease.

  "explanation_2": "#Genome-wide association studies# (GWAS) are typically case-control studies that involve scanning thousands of genetic markers in subjects with and without a disease to identify #associations between genetic variants# (eg, loci) and that #disease#.  GWAS often use single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), with several million SNPs analyzed on 1 microscope slide. $In this case, GWAS are used to analyze #hundreds of thousands of loci# in Portuguese patients with and without rheumatoid arthritis (RA).  The results are compared to those from a larger European cohort; both studies are then combined in a meta-analysis.  A few loci have SNPs with an allele that is significantly more common among patients with RA than those without RA; these loci are therefore associated with RA. $Whenever #multiple tests# are performed simultaneously (eg, analyzing thousands of loci), the possibility of #false-positive results# increases.  Using a much #smaller threshold for the p-value# is a method to minimize this.  Traditionally, a p-value <5% is considered statistically significant.  However, if 100,000 loci are studied at that 5% (ie, 0.05, 5 √ó 10‚àí2) level, then 100,000 √ó 0.05 = 5,000 false positives would be expected.  With a much smaller p-value, this number decreases substantially.  For this reason, a p-value of 5 √ó 10‚àí8 (\"genome-wide p-value\"), as seen here, is often chosen in GWAS. $#(Choice A)#  A meta-analysis combines results from different studies, thereby increasing sample size, which increases power (eg, to detect statistical differences between groups). $#(Choice B)#  Logistic regression was used because it analyzes the association between exposures (eg, multiple loci) and binary outcomes (eg, yes = cases with RA; no = controls without RA). $#(Choice C)#  An odds ratio (OR) <1 does not imply a lack of statistically significant association.  If an OR >1 means that patients with RA have higher odds of having a specific locus compared to those without RA (ie, risk factor), an OR <1 means that patients with RA have lower odds of having that specific locus (ie, protective factor).  The OR for the association between Locus 1 and RA is statistically significant because its p-value (3.5 √ó 10‚àí8) is less than the genome-wide p-value (5 √ó 10‚àí8). $#(Choice E)#  GWAS help explain disease heritability (ie, effect of genotypic differences on phenotypic differences).  Although this study identified 3 new loci, there is no indication that the full group of 33 loci will explain most RA disease heritability.  GWAS have identified many genes associated with specific conditions, but these genes only seem to explain a small amount of the variance (\"missing heritability\"). $#Educational objective# Genome-wide association studies aim to identify associations between thousands of genetic variants and a disease.  Because of the increased risk of false-positive results when multiple tests are performed simultaneously, a smaller genome-wide p-value is typically used. "

  "explanation_2": "$The #positive predictive value# (PPV) of a diagnostic test is the probability (ie, likelihood) that an individual truly #has the disease# given a #positive test#.  PPV is equal to the number of individuals who have the disease and who test positive (ie, true positives [TP]) divided by the total number of individuals with a positive test result (TP + false positives [FP]): $‚Ä¢# PPV# = TP / (TP + FP) $To determine PPV in this example, it helps to construct a @2 √ó 2 table@ with the expected data for this population according to the properties of the diagnostic test.  In this example, the pediatrician examined 1,000 children in a population with a 10% prevalence of asthma (ie, 100 children have asthma, 900 do not).  The sensitivity, which is equal to TP / (TP + false negatives [FN]), and the specificity, which is equal to true negatives (TN) / (TN + FP), are 95% and 80% respectively.  Therefore, the number of #TP is 95# (ie, 100 √ó 0.95), the number of #FN is 5# (ie, 100 ‚àí 95), the number of #TN is 720# (ie, 900 √ó 0.80), and the number of #FP is 180# (ie, 900 ‚àí 720). $The PPV can be calculated as follows: $‚Ä¢ # PV# = TP / (TP + FP) = 95 / (95 + 180) $Predictive values #depend on the prevalence# of the disease in the study population; as the disease prevalence increases, PPV increases and NPV decreases, and vice versa. $#(Choice A)#  5 / (5 + 95) is the false negative rate (FNR).  FNR is equal to FN / (FN + TP) and describes the proportion of individuals with a known positive condition for which the test result is negative.  It is also known as the miss rate. $#(Choice C)#  95 / (95 + 5) is the test's sensitivity.  Sensitivity is equal to TP / (TP + FN) and describes the proportion of individuals with a known positive condition for which the test result is positive.  It is an intrinsic measure of the test's ability to correctly identify individuals with the disease, but by itself, it does not provide enough information to interpret a positive test result in a particular individual. $#(Choice D)#  720 / (720 + 180) is the test's specificity.  Specificity is equal to TN / (TN + FP) and describes the proportion of individuals with a known negative condition for which the test result is negative. $#(Choice E)#  720 / (720 + 5) is the test's negative predictive value (NPV).  NPV is equal to TN / (TN + FN) and describes the proportion of individuals with a negative test result who really do not have the disease. $#Educational objective# Positive predictive value is the probability that an individual has a disease given a positive test.  It is calculated as follows: true positives / (true positives + false positives). ",

  "explanation_2": "$One of the objectives for the national Healthy People 2020 initiative is to reduce the prevalence of tobacco smoking in adults from 20% in 2008 to less than 12% by 2020.  Tobacco use, especially smoking, is the single most preventable cause of death and disease in the United States.  In addition to its numerous direct adverse effects, tobacco smoking also substantially increases the risk for macrovascular (eg, myocardial infarction [MI], stroke) and microvascular (eg, retinopathy, nephropathy) complications of diabetes mellitus.  These complications significantly increase mortality, primarily by increasing the risk of MI.  The risk of MI-associated mortality begins to decrease immediately upon smoking cessation.  However, it takes several tobacco-free years before the risk returns to baseline, especially in patients with a long history of smoking.  In addition, smokers with diabetes have a higher likelihood of developing hypercholesterolemia, poor glycemic control, and end-stage renal disease.  It appears that smoking not only worsens the complications of diabetes but also increases the likelihood of developing diabetes in the first place, thus highlighting the importance of prevention and early cessation. $#(Choice A)#  Fecal occult blood testing screens for colorectal cancer and improves mortality through earlier detection.  Even so, the mortality benefit is much lower than that achieved by smoking cessation. $#(Choice B)#  Prostate-specific antigen is increased in some patients with prostate cancer.  However, annual prostate-specific antigen testing has not been shown to improve mortality from prostate cancer. $#(Choice C)#  Aspirin use significantly reduces the risk of death from coronary heart disease in diabetic patients, at levels similar to smoking cessation.  However, when all-cause mortality is compared, smoking cessation has a greater effect on reducing mortality than daily aspirin therapy. $#(Choices D, E, and G)#  Dietary modification and exercise reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (to a lesser extent than smoking cessation) and help improve glycemic control in diabetic individuals.  Although tight glycemic control has been shown to reduce the risk of microvascular complications from diabetes, it does not significantly improve cardiovascular or all-cause mortality. $#Educational objective# Smoking cessation is by far the most effective preventive intervention in almost all patients, and this is especially true in those with diabetes.

  "explanation_2": "#Obesity# is a multifactorial condition with genetic, environmental, and behavioral causes.  In this community, obesity prevalence is significantly higher in specific ZIP codes, indicating a possible #health disparity# (ie, preventable health differences associated with social, environmental, or economic disadvantage). $Obesity-related health disparities represent a major public health concern with increased prevalence, severity, and complications affecting vulnerable communities.  Such disparities involve factors relating to #health care# (eg, provider screening and treatment, access to care), #patients# (eg, diet and activity, health knowledge), and #neighborhood# (eg, density of grocery stores, which influences dietary patterns; crime rate, which influences physical activity). $Given the multifactorial nature of obesity and related disparities, the #first step# in researching this community's trend is to generate hypotheses.  This is best achieved through #cross-sectional analysis# of demographic and behavioral data, which is relatively easy to perform and can depict multiple risk factors at one point in time (a \"snapshot\") to: $‚Ä¢ reveal #differences in distribution# (prevalence) of #demographic# factors (eg, poverty, ethnicity, insurance status) across ZIP codes. $‚Ä¢ identify variables #correlated# (associated) with #obesity risk# (eg, poverty is more prevalent in high-obesity ZIP codes). $‚Ä¢ #generate hypotheses# (eg, poverty increases obesity risk by decreasing ability to consume foods promoting optimal weight). $Other study designs are more appropriate for testing or refining hypotheses following broader cross-sectional analysis. $#(Choices B and D)#  Like cross-sectional analysis, cohort studies and qualitative surveys offer observational data for generating hypotheses.  However, each of these approaches focuses on a single, patient-related hypothesis (eg, leptin, patient knowledge and attitudes) for obesity differences.  Cross-sectional analysis involving this community's demographic factors is a better first step, as it can analyze multiple potential influences and tailor hypotheses to this setting. $#(Choice C)#  Quality improvement studies analyze and test clinical processes (eg, providing obesity screening) affecting health care quality.  They are less useful for generating broad hypotheses for community epidemiological patterns (eg, obesity trends). $#(Choice E)#  Randomized controlled trials are more appropriate for testing (rather than generating) hypotheses; such trials would be premature at this stage.  Moreover, this approach tests only health care factors whereas cross-sectional analysis can assess how other risk factors correlate to obesity risk in this community. $#Educational objective# Obesity-related health disparities affect vulnerable populations (eg, lower socioeconomic status) and arise from patient, health care, and community-related factors.  Cross-sectional analysis can identify specific risk factors (eg, insurance status, health behaviors) correlated to obesity in different settings, helping to generate hypotheses for further research.
