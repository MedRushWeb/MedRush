It also #prolongs the QT interval# on ECG, which increases the risk of torsade de pointes; however, compared to other class III antiarrhythmics (eg, dofetilide, ibutilide), the risk of torsade de pointes with amiodarone is low. $Amiodarone also has the following effects: $• Class I effect: Amiodarone somewhat #inhibits# the #fast sodium channels# responsible for cardiomyocyte depolarization (phase 0).

  "explanation_2": "The hemodynamic actions of #epinephrine# occur secondary to agonistic effects at α1, β1, and β2 adrenoreceptors (relative strength:  #β1 = β2 > α1#).  Stimulation of β1 receptors in the heart increases cardiac rate and contractility, which increases systolic blood pressure due to the rise in cardiac output.  Stimulation of β2 receptors in the skeletal muscle vasculature produces vasodilation and decreased diastolic blood pressure, while activation of α1 receptors on vascular smooth muscle in the skin and viscera increases peripheral resistance and raises diastolic blood pressure.  At #low doses#, β2-mediated #vasodilation predominates#, whereas at high doses α1-induced vasoconstriction becomes more pronounced. $In this experiment, low-dose epinephrine by itself caused #increased heart rate# (β1 response) and #decreased diastolic blood pressure# (β2 response).  However, after pretreatment with drug A, the heart rate fails to increase and there is a marked rise in diastolic blood pressure.  These effects are best explained by pretreatment with a #nonselective beta antagonist# such as propranolol.  When administered alone, propranolol produces peripheral vasoconstriction (β2 antagonism) without significantly increasing blood pressure (due to concomitant β1 blockade).  However, in combination with epinephrine, propranolol will counteract epinephrine's β2-mediated vasodilation and β1-mediated heart rate increase while leaving the α1 effect (vasoconstriction) intact.  This will increase diastolic blood pressure and cause a slight reflexive reduction in heart rate. $#(Choice A)#  Atropine is a competitive antagonist of cholinergic muscarinic receptors in the heart (M2).  Atropine increases the heart rate by blocking parasympathetic vagal influence; after pretreatment with atropine, epinephrine-mediated tachycardia would increase. $#(Choice B)#  Isoproterenol is a nonselective β-adrenergic agonist that stimulates both β2 receptors on vascular smooth muscle (leading to vasodilatation) and cardiac β1 receptors (leading to increases in cardiac rate and contractility).  A combination of isoproterenol and epinephrine would further decrease diastolic blood pressure and exacerbate the tachycardia. $#(Choice C)#  Phentolamine is a nonspecific alpha-1 and alpha-2 blocker with no beta-blocking effects that cause a profound fall in diastolic blood pressure and reflex tachycardia.  If this were drug A, blood pressure would have decreased further in the pretreatment group and the rise in heart rate would have been exacerbated. $#(Choice D)#  Phenylephrine is a selective α-adrenergic agonist.  Administration by itself may cause elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressures, which may be associated with reflex bradycardia.  However, after pretreatment, epinephrine would still produce an initial rise in heart rate due to unopposed β1 stimulation. $#Educational objective# Epinephrine increases systolic blood pressure (α1 + β1) and heart rate (β1), and either increases or decreases diastolic blood pressure depending on the dose (either α1 or β2 predominates).  Pretreatment with propranolol eliminates the β effects of epinephrine (vasodilatation and tachycardia), leaving only the α effect (vasoconstriction). "

The physician most likely added a #potassium-sparing diuretic# to this patient's treatment regimen to minimize potassium loss caused by loop diuretic use.  All diuretics except for the potassium-sparing class cause potassium loss by increasing sodium delivery to the #late distal tubule# and #cortical collecting duct#, where aldosterone-induced sodium reabsorption occurs at the expense of potassium.  Potassium-sparing diuretics act primarily by antagonizing this effect of aldosterone. $Some potassium-sparing diuretics, such as amiloride and triamterene, function by directly blocking the epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs) in the apical membrane of principal cells.  Others, including spironolactone and eplerenone, competitively inhibit the aldosterone receptor, causing downregulation of both the apical ENaCs and basolateral Na+/K+ pumps.  Spironolactone and eplerenone (a more specific receptor antagonist than spironolactone with fewer side effects) are preferred in patients with heart failure because they can also prevent the deleterious effects of #aldosterone-induced cardiac remodeling#. $#(Choice A)#  Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (eg, acetazolamide, dorzolamide) block sodium and bicarbonate reabsorption in the proximal convoluted tubule.

Patients with stable angina should be started on aspirin to decrease the risk of adverse cardiovascular events.  Aspirin impairs prostaglandin synthesis by irreversibly inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX).  Inhibition of COX-1 in platelets prevents synthesis of thromboxane A2, a potent stimulator of platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction.  This helps reduce the risk of occlusive thrombus formation and subsequent myocardial infarction. $Some patients are unable to tolerate aspirin due to exacerbation of preexisting respiratory symptoms (eg, rhinitis, asthma) or development of allergic reactions (eg, urticaria, angioedema, anaphylaxis).  In these patients, alternate antiplatelet agents should be used for prevention of cardiovascular events.  #Clopidogrel# irreversibly #blocks# the P2Y12 component of #ADP receptors# on the platelet surface and prevents platelet aggregation.

Eptifibatide is occasionally used in some patients with acute coronary syndrome, but it is not used for patients with stable CHD. $#(Choice F)#  Naproxen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is used for pain management in patients with osteoarthritis.

  "explanation_2": "This patient has a severe elevation in his #LDL# level.  This degree of hyperlipidemia, especially with a family history of coronary artery disease, suggests familial hypercholesterolemia and confers a very high risk for cardiovascular events.  #HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors# (statins) are the first-line therapy for most patients with hypercholesterolemia and have been proven to reduce the risk of cardiac events.  The statins are structural analogs of HMG-CoA and competitively inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme responsible for the rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis. $Serious side effects of statins include #myopathy# and #hepatitis#.  Although mild elevations of liver enzymes are common, significant liver injury (aspartate transaminase/alanine transaminase levels more than 3 times the upper limit of normal) is seen in less than 1% of patients and is usually reversible if the medication is discontinued.  #Liver function tests# are recommended before starting statin therapy; otherwise, routine monitoring is not necessary unless symptoms of hepatic injury develop (eg, fatigue, malaise, anorexia). $#(Choice A)#  Apolipoprotein-B (Apo-B) is a structural protein found in atherogenic lipoprotein particles.  Each lipoprotein particle contains only a single Apo-B molecule, so measurement of Apo-B levels can quantify the LDL particle count.  Patients with increased LDL particle counts are at greater risk for cardiovascular events.  However, measurement is of limited clinical utility and would not change management in this case. $#(Choice B)#  Statin medications do not cause any significant hematologic toxicity. $#(Choice C)#  Lipoprotein lipase deficiency can cause familial hypertriglyceridemia (heterozygous deficiency) and chylomicronemia (homozygous deficiency) syndromes.  These conditions present with elevated serum triglyceride levels but do not cause elevation in LDL levels. $#(Choice E)#  Because cholesterol is a precursor in the synthesis of adrenocortical and gonadal steroid hormones, statin medications can, in theory, cause hypogonadism or hypoadrenalism.  Clinically, however, there are no significant alterations in serum cortisol or gonadal steroid levels unless patients are also on other adrenal enzyme inhibitors (eg, ketoconazole, aminoglutethimide). $#(Choice F)#  Statins have no significant renal side effects.  In rare instances, they can cause rhabdomyolysis, which can precipitate acute renal failure; however, this occurs less commonly than hepatic dysfunction and would be associated with myalgias and myoglobinuria. $#Educational objective# Common side effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) include muscle and liver toxicity.  Hepatic transaminases should be checked prior to initiating therapy and repeated if symptoms of hepatic injury occur. "

  "explanation_2": "$#Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation# is usually treated with rate or rhythm control strategies.  Rate control uses AV nodal-blocking drugs (beta blockers, calcium channel blockers) to prevent rapid ventricular response, whereas #rhythm control# attempts to maintain sinus rhythm with antiarrhythmic drugs (eg, sotalol, flecainide, amiodarone). $The QT interval represents both ventricular depolarization and repolarization (total duration of ventricular action potential).  However, ventricular depolarization normally contributes only a small amount of time to the interval, and in practice, the QT interval is primarily used as a measure of ventricular repolarization.  #Class III antiarrhythmics# (eg, sotalol, amiodarone, dofetilide) predominantly #block potassium channels# and inhibit outward repolarizing currents during phase 3 of the cardiomyocyte action potential.  This leads to increased action potential duration and #QT interval prolongation#, which predisposes to the development of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (#torsades de pointes# [TdP]).  Amiodarone has a lesser proarrhythmic effect than other class III drugs; therefore, TdP is less frequently observed with amiodarone than with sotalol. $#(Choice A)#  Diltiazem is a class IV antiarrhythmic drug (calcium channel blocker) that inhibits L-type calcium channels during phase 2 (@cardiomyocyte action potential@) and phase 0 (nodal action potential) depolarization.  It slows the sinus rate, prolongs conduction through the AV node, and depresses myocardial contractility (negative inotropic effect) but does not prolong the QT interval. $#(Choice B)#  Metoprolol is a class II antiarrhythmic drug that is a selective beta-1 receptor antagonist.  It acts as a negative inotropic and chronotropic agent by decreasing myocardial contractility and heart rate.  Unlike sotalol, beta blockers do not have any potassium channel-blocking properties and do not prolong the QT interval. $#(Choice C)#  Mexiletine is a class IB antiarrhythmic drug that blocks sodium channels, inhibiting the initial depolarization phase (phase 0) of the cardiomyocyte action potential.  It is occasionally used to maintain sinus rhythm in patients with paroxysmal symptomatic atrial fibrillation, but it does not prolong the QT interval. $#(Choice D)#  Ranolazine is an antianginal agent and exerts its effect by inhibiting the late phase of inward sodium channels in ischemic cardiac myocytes.  It also blocks potassium channels and causes a dose-dependent increase in QT interval; however, TdP has not been reported in ranolazine use. $#Educational objective# Sotalol has both beta adrenergic-blocking and class III antiarrhythmic (K+ channel-blocking) properties and is occasionally used in treatment of atrial fibrillation.

  "explanation_2": "$#Amiodarone# is a @class III antiarrhythmic drug@ used for the management of a variety of supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias.  Class III drugs predominantly block #potassium channels# and inhibit the outward potassium currents during @phase 3@ of the cardiac action potential, prolonging repolarization and total action potential duration (APD). $The #QT interval# represents the time required for ventricular depolarization and repolarization; it can be regarded as a rough estimate of the APD.  Drugs that significantly prolong the cardiac action potential (eg, class IA and III antiarrhythmics) cause prolongation of the QT interval.  Prolonged QT is associated with a form of ventricular tachycardia called @torsades de pointes@ (polymorphic ventricular tachycardia).  However, unlike other drugs that cause QT prolongation, amiodarone has #very little risk# of inducing torsades de pointes.  This effect is thought to be due to it having a more homogeneous effect on ventricular repolarization compared to other drugs (ie, less QT dispersion). $#(Choice A)#  Adenosine interacts with A1 receptors on cardiac cells and activates potassium channels, increasing potassium conductance.  It causes a transient conduction delay through the atrioventricular (AV) node and is used for acute termination of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT).  Adenosine is rapidly metabolized in the blood and tissues and has a very brief duration of action. $#(Choice C)#  Digoxin slows AV nodal conduction speed by augmenting vagal parasympathetic tone and increases cardiac contractility by inhibiting Na+/K+-ATPase (increases intracellular calcium).  It also decreases the APD and can cause QT interval shortening. $#(Choice D)#  Esmolol is a rapidly acting, short-duration beta blocker (class II antiarrhythmic) that slows the rate of discharge of sinus or ectopic pacemakers and increases the refractory period of the AV node.  It has no effect on QT interval. $#(Choice E)#  Lidocaine is a class IB antiarrhythmic drug that acts by blocking sodium channels and inhibiting phase 0 depolarization.  It does not prolong the QT interval. $#(Choice F)#  Procainamide is a class IA antiarrhythmic drug that inhibits sodium-dependent (phase 0) depolarization.  It also has moderate potassium channel blocking activity, leading to prolongation of APD and the QT interval with an increased risk of torsades de pointes. $#(Choice G)#  Verapamil is a cardio-selective calcium channel blocker (class IV antiarrhythmic drug).  It slows the sinus rate and prolongs the PR interval by slowing conduction through the AV node.  It does not prolong the QT interval. $#Educational objective# Amiodarone (and other class III and class IA antiarrhythmic agents) causes lengthening of the cardiac action potential, which manifests as QT interval prolongation on ECG.  QT prolongation caused by amiodarone, in contrast to other drugs, is associated with a very low risk of torsades de pointes.  ",

In response to these changes, hepatocytes increase their surface expression of the #LDL receptor# to increase uptake of circulating LDL.

This risk reduction is greater than that seen with other classes of lipid-lowering medications and is likely due to additional properties of statins.  Besides effects on lipids, statins have anti-inflammatory properties, improve endothelial dysfunction, and appear to stabilize atherosclerotic plaques. $#(Choice A)#  ApoB-100 is an apoprotein present in VLDL and LDL.  Decreases in circulating LDL and VLDL will cause the ApoB-100 concentration to decrease as well. $#(Choice B)#  The biliary excretion of cholesterol decreases in patients on statins due to decreased de novo hepatic synthesis of cholesterol. $#(Choice D)#  Statins lower serum triglycerides modestly and have only a minimal effect on plasma free fatty acid concentrations. $#(Choice E)#  Statins produce small decreases in VLDL.  Fibrates and nicotinic acid therapy decrease hepatic production of VLDL and are the mainstay of treatment for primary hypertriglyceridemia (increased VLDL). $#Educational objective# Treatment with statins causes hepatocytes to increase their LDL receptor density, leading to increased uptake of circulating LDL.

The toxicity is dependent on the cumulative dose of anthracycline; affected patients develop symptoms of heart failure (eg, dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, peripheral edema) anywhere from several weeks to years following treatment. $Anthracyclines exert their antitumor effect by binding to the #topoisomerase II# enzyme in cancer cells to create DNA cleavage complexes that #break DNA# and cause cell death.  Anthracycline cardiotoxicity results from a similar anthracycline–topoisomerase II complex that forms in healthy cardiomyocytes.  In addition, anthracycline can form iron-containing complexes that produce DNA-damaging free radicals, which likely also plays a role in cardiotoxicity. $The most effective method of preventing anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy is the administration of #dexrazoxane#, a chelating agent thought to both block the formation of iron-associated free radicals and inhibit the formation of anthracycline–topoisomerase II complexes in healthy cardiomyocytes. $#(Choice B)#  Focal myocardial scarring commonly results following a myocardial infarction. $#(Choice C)#  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is an autosomal dominant disorder often caused by mutation of the beta-myosin heavy chain. $#(Choice D)#  Pericardial thickening and fibrosis usually follow cardiac surgery, radiation therapy, or viral infections of the pericardium. $#(Choice E)#  Restrictive cardiomyopathy often occurs as the initial cardiac manifestation of infiltrative disease (eg, hemochromatosis, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis) or may occur with radiation therapy. $#(Choice F)#  Right ventricular pressure overload can occur with acute pulmonary embolism.

Most of the clinically useful agents bind within the pore of the channel during the @open and/or inactivated@ states; dissociation of the drug occurs during the resting state.  This state-dependent manner of binding causes a phenomenon in which tissues undergoing frequent depolarization become more susceptible to blockage (#use dependence#).  The faster the heart rate, the more time the Na+ channels spend in the open and inactivated states and the more that become blocked. $The binding strength of class I antiarrhythmics varies between the different subclasses, with #Class IB# agents (eg, lidocaine) having the #weakest binding# compared to other class I antiarrhythmics.  Dissociation from the channels occurs so rapidly that there is minimal cumulative effect over multiple cardiac cycles, resulting in little use dependence.  These drugs are more #selective for ischemic myocardium# because the elevated (less negative) resting membrane potential delays Na+ channel transition from the inactivated to the resting state, resulting in increased drug binding.  As such, class IB antiarrhythmics are useful for treating #ischemia-induced ventricular arrhythmias#. $In contrast, #class IC# agents (eg, propafenone, flecainide) have the strongest binding #(choice B)#.  They are the #slowest to dissociate# from the channel, which allows their blocking effects to accumulate over multiple cardiac cycles.  This leads to substantially greater blockade at higher heart rates (#high use dependence#), making them particularly effective at #terminating tachyarrhythmias#.  However, the prominent use-dependent effects of class IC drugs can cause an excessive delay in conduction speed that can promote arrhythmias, especially in patients with ischemic or structural heart disease. $#(Choice A)#  Disopyramide, quinidine, and procainamide are class IA antiarrhythmic drugs that have an intermediate dissociation speed.  The dissociation curve for the new drug shows that drug-channel dissociation is faster than with quinidine, indicating that it is most similar to a class IB antiarrhythmic agent such as lidocaine. $#(Choice D)#  Propranolol is a nonselective beta-adrenergic blocker (class II antiarrhythmic).  It causes decreased chronotropy and inotropy via beta-1 blockade. $#(Choice E)#  Class III antiarrhythmic drugs (amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide) act predominantly by blocking potassium channels and prolonging phase 3 repolarization.  Sotalol also has beta-blocking activity. $#(Choice F)#  Verapamil and diltiazem are calcium channel blockers that function as class IV antiarrhythmics due to their effects on cardiac slow-response tissue.  Although nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker as well, it is selective for vascular smooth muscle and does not have a notable effect on the heart. $#Educational objective# For class I antiarrhythmics, sodium-channel-binding strength is #IC > IA > IB#.  Use dependence describes the phenomenon in which higher heart rates lead to increased sodium channel blockade due to cumulative blocking effects over multiple cardiac cycles.  Class IC antiarrhythmics demonstrate the most use dependence due to their slow dissociation from the receptor, and class IB drugs have the least use dependence as they rapidly dissociate.  ",

This phenomenon is termed #permissiveness#; it occurs when a hormone has #no direct effect# on a physiologic process but #allows another hormone to exert its maximal effect# on that process.  Cortisol exerts its potentiating effect on vasoconstriction in part through upregulation of alpha-1 adrenergic receptors on vascular smooth muscle cells.  In adrenal insufficiency, low cortisol levels can contribute to hypotensive crisis by decreasing vascular responsiveness to norepinephrine and angiotensin II. $Cortisol also has a permissive effect on catecholamine-mediated bronchodilation and glucagon-mediated release of glucose from the liver. $#(Choices A and D)#  The combination of 2 drugs with similar actions can have a @synergistic or additive@ effect.

This occurs via the following 2 mechanisms: $• Beta blockers #reduce heart rate#, which lengthens diastolic filling time to increase LV end-diastolic volume (ie, preload) $• Beta blockers #reduce LV contractility#, which decreases the amount of blood ejected during ventricular systole (ie, increased end-systolic volume) $Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, verapamil) have similar effects and can be used in patients with a contraindication to beta blockers or as additional therapy for persistent symptoms. $#(Choice A)#  Some patients with HCM may experience anginal symptoms due to inadequate blood supply to the increased myocardial mass.

In the months following infarction, the affected myocardium undergoes fibroblastic proliferation and fibrosis to repair the necrotic region (ie, initial #remodeling# phase); disproportionate thinning of the infarcted area can lead to ballooning of affected segments and marked #LV cavity enlargement#.  Although LV cavity enlargement is initially beneficial as it acts as a compensatory mechanism for LV volume overload, progressive cavity enlargement (eg, eccentric hypertrophy) leads to @overwhelming wall stress@ and further worsening of LV contractile dysfunction.  With progressive dilation, the LV begins to assume a spherical, rather than its normal elliptical, shape. $Much of the deleterious remodeling that occurs following myocardial infarction is likely driven by neurohormonal signaling via #angiotensin II#.  Accordingly, #ACE inhibitors# (eg, lisinopril) #reduce the deleterious remodeling# that takes place following myocardial infarction, #minimizing LV dilation# and helping preserve LV function. $#(Choices B and C)#  Angiotensin II enhances post–myocardial infarction collagen deposition to contribute to deleterious cardiac remodeling.  This effect is especially prominent in peri-infarct cardiomyocytes (cardiomyocytes at the edge of an infarction), which have high angiotensin II levels.  ACE inhibitors reduce deleterious cardiac remodeling at least in part via inhibition of myocardial collagen deposition and fibrosis. $#(Choice D)#  Noninfarcted cardiac segments (eg, the basal segments in this patient) are subject to postinfarction remodeling caused by LV hemodynamic influences (eg, pressure and volume changes).  ACE inhibitors also reduce remodeling of these segments, further contributing to maintenance of the normal LV elliptical shape and preservation of LV contractile function. $#(Choice E)#  Stroke work is the work done by the left ventricle with each contraction and is estimated by the product of stroke volume and LV systolic pressure (ie, stroke volume × LV systolic pressure).  ACE inhibitors reduce stroke work by causing peripheral vasodilation and reducing systemic blood pressure (ie, reducing the pressure the left ventricle must overcome during each contraction). $#Educational objective# Following myocardial infarction, collagen deposition and fibrosis within the infarct region and eccentric hypertrophy of surviving myocytes can lead to progressive left ventricular (LV) dilation and worsening contractile dysfunction.  Because much of this remodeling is driven by neurohormonal signaling via angiotensin II, ACE inhibitors (eg, lisinopril) reduce deleterious cardiac remodeling following myocardial infarction, minimizing LV dilation and helping preserve contractile function.

  "explanation_2": "Adequate #rate control# (eg, resting heart rate <85/min) is important in #atrial fibrillation# because it minimizes symptoms and helps decrease the risk of tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.  Beta blockers (eg, metoprolol) #slow conduction# through the #atrioventricular (AV) node# via inhibition of sympathetic stimulation and are typically first-line therapy for rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation.  This patient was unable to tolerate the dose of metoprolol needed to maintain an appropriate resting heart rate; therefore, #digoxin# was added for increased rate control.  Digoxin slows conduction through the AV node via #increased parasympathetic (vagal) tone#. $Several mechanisms may explain the parasympathetic effects of digoxin.  Inhibition of the sodium-potassium ATPase pump in vagal afferent fibers sensitizes arterial baroreceptors (eg, carotid, aortic) and cardiac volume receptors, augmenting afferent input from the cardiovascular system to the brain.  In addition, digoxin enhances efferent parasympathetic ganglionic transmission, leading to #increased vagal output#. $This mechanism of increased parasympathetic tone is effective in controlling heart rate at rest but is limited in controlling heart rate during exercise, when sympathetic tone is high.  Therefore, digoxin is rarely used as monotherapy for rate control and is more typically combined with a beta blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (eg, verapamil, diltiazem). $#(Choices A and B)#  Decreased atrial refractoriness and decreased cardiomyocyte action potential duration both occur with digoxin, increasing the automaticity of the atrial myocardium and encouraging the development of atrial fibrillation and other atrial arrhythmias.  However, these effects are typically problematic only at toxic digoxin levels and at therapeutic levels are outweighed by the beneficial effect of increased parasympathetic tone. $#(Choice C)#  Digoxin increases (rather than decreases) Purkinje fiber automaticity, encouraging the development of ventricular arrhythmias (eg, ventricular tachycardia).  Like the proarrhythmic effects on the atrial myocardium, this effect is typically problematic only at toxic digoxin levels. $#(Choice E)#  Digoxin increases ventricular contractility (positive inotropy) by inhibiting the sodium-potassium ATPase pump to increase intracellular sodium and consequently @increase intracellular calcium@.  This effect can improve cardiac output and symptoms (eg, dyspnea, orthopnea) in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction, but it does not contribute to improved rate control. $#Educational objective# Digoxin can be used to improve ventricular rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation, as it decreases atrioventricular node conduction by increasing parasympathetic (vagal) tone.  Digoxin also has a positive inotropic effect that can be useful in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. ",

However, interference with post-receptor signaling can alter platelet function.  In particular, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) activates a family of enzymes known as the cAMP-dependent protein kinases, or protein kinase A, and leads to inhibition of platelet aggregation.  Agents that increase intra-platelet cAMP levels decrease platelet aggregation by preventing platelet shape change and granule release. $#Cilostazol# reduces #platelet activation# by inhibiting platelet phosphodiesterase, the enzyme responsible for the breakdown of cAMP.

Patients with clinically significant PAD should take antiplatelet agents (aspirin or clopidogrel) to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events (secondary prevention), but antiplatelet agents do not improve PAD symptoms. $#(Choice G)#  Warfarin is an oral anticoagulant that is a competitive inhibitor of vitamin K epoxide reductase and reduces production of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors (II, VII, IX, X, protein C, protein S).  It is used in the long-term treatment and prevention of thromboembolic events but does not reduce claudication in symptomatic PAD. $#Educational objective# Symptomatic management of peripheral artery disease (PAD) includes a graded exercise program and cilostazol.

Appropriate pharmacologic management is important in such patients because it has been shown to reduce mortality.  Much of this #mortality benefit# is likely related to a #reduction# in deleterious #cardiac remodeling#. $Neurohormonal pathways involving norepinephrine, angiotensin II, and aldosterone all have a demonstrated role in cardiac remodeling.  In particular, elevated angiotensin II and aldosterone levels increase pathologic cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and stimulate collagen deposition by fibroblasts (cardiac fibrosis).  Accordingly, #ACE inhibitors# (eg, lisinopril), #angiotensin-receptor blockers# (eg, losartan), and #mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists# (eg, spironolactone, epleronone) reduce mortality in patients with HFrEF via a reduction in angiotensin II–mediated (and downstream aldosterone-mediated) cardiac remodeling. $#Beta blockers# (eg, metoprolol, carvedilol) also reduce mortality in patients with chronic HFrEF, likely through similar inhibition of neurohormonal mechanisms.  Potentiation of the natriuretic peptide neurohormonal pathway with #angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor# therapy (eg, sacubitril-valsartan) has also demonstrated mortality benefit in these patients. $#(Choice A)#  Blood pressure control is important for patients with heart failure because it slows the progression of coronary artery disease and may reduce cardiac remodeling that is triggered by increased left ventricular pressure load.  However, aside from the benefit of blood pressure reduction, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, amlodipine) provide no additional mortality benefit in patients with HFrEF. $#(Choice B)#  Digoxin is used as an adjunctive therapy in patients with HFrEF.  It improves symptoms, thereby reducing the rate of hospitalization, but does not improve mortality. $#(Choice C)#  Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, verapamil, diltiazem) can depress cardiac contractility and are usually contraindicated in patients with HFrEF. $#(Choices D and E)#  Loop (eg, furosemide) and thiazide (eg, metolazone) diuretics reduce cardiac preload and are useful for symptomatic management of patients with HFrEF; however, these drugs do not provide a clear mortality benefit. $#(Choice G)#  Although potassium-sparing diuretics that function via blockade of mineralocorticoid receptors have shown mortality benefit for HFrEF, those that act via blockade of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) (eg, triamterene, amiloride) have minimal neurohormonal effects and no demonstrated benefit. $#Educational objective# Neurohormones (eg, norepinephrine, angiotensin II, and aldosterone) play a large role in the deleterious cardiac remodeling that occurs in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.  ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, beta blockers, and angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors reduce mortality in these patients by reducing neurohormonal-mediated cardiac remodeling.

Statins are an effective treatment for hypercholesteremia and are now routinely prescribed for all patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease, regardless of baseline cholesterol levels.  Myopathy is the most common complication of statin use, and symptoms can range from myalgia or myopathy, with or without myonecrosis (elevated serum creatine kinase), to frank rhabdomyolysis. $Statins act through competitive #inhibition# of #HMG-CoA reductase#, preventing conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid (the rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis).  Decreased liver cholesterol synthesis leads to increased hepatic clearance of LDL from the circulation by LDL receptors.  After mediating endocytosis of LDL particles, the LDL receptors are returned to the cell surface for reuse (receptor recycling); LDL is digested and used for metabolic purposes.  This #increase in LDL receptor recycling# allows intrahepatic cholesterol levels to remain at normal levels while blood levels are kept low. $#(Choice A)#  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs inhibit cyclooxygenase (prostaglandin synthase), leading to decreased synthesis of gastric mucosal prostaglandin. $#(Choice B)#  Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II.  ACE also acts as a kininase, and ACE inhibition also leads to increased plasma bradykinin levels. $#(Choice C)#  Stimulation of beta-2 receptors by catecholamines increases extracellular potassium movement into cells.  This effect is blocked by beta-blockers (primarily non-selective agents such as propranolol or labetalol), which impair potassium entry into cells and cause minor elevations in plasma potassium. $#(Choice E)#  Thiazide diuretics increase calcium reabsorption in the distal tubule of the nephron and can lead to hypercalcemia.  In contrast, decreased calcium excretion is useful in patients with renal stones due to hypercalciuria. $#(Choice F)#  Metformin inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis via inhibition of the mitochondrial isoform of glycerophosphate dehydrogenase in the liver.  Typical side effects of metformin include gastrointestinal upset and diarrhea.  Myopathy is not a common effect. $#Educational objective# Statins inhibit the intracellular rate-limiting step of cholesterol biosynthesis via competitive inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase.

The Na+-K+-ATPase pump allows the potassium and sodium gradients to be maintained across the membrane. $The ion flow graph after drug A administration shows a #decrease in outward potassium flow# from the myocyte during phase 3 repolarization of the myocardial action potential.

Digoxin does not affect potassium channels and has minimal effect on potassium efflux from myocardial cells during the action potential. $#(Choice D)#  Esmolol is a rapid-acting, short-duration beta blocker (class II antiarrhythmic) that slows the rate of discharge of sinus or ectopic pacemakers and increases the refractory period of the AV node.

When beta-adrenergic blockade is abruptly withdrawn, the increased density of beta-adrenergic receptors creates an amplified response to circulating catecholamines (ie, #increased sensitivity#). $Because metoprolol is cardioselective and primarily blocks beta-1 receptors, abrupt cessation stimulates beta-1 receptor–mediated #increased heart rate# and #cardiac contractility#.  There is also #increased blood pressure# due to increased cardiac output.  These changes create #increased oxygen demand# that may cause ischemia (evidenced by ST depression on ECG) and trigger #angina# in patients with underlying coronary artery disease. $#(Choice A)#  Beta blocker withdrawal symptoms result from an increase in the density of beta-adrenergic receptors, leading to an amplified response to circulating catecholamines.  The level of circulating catecholamines is unchanged from baseline. $#(Choice B)#  Alpha-adrenergic receptors are predominantly activated in the setting of beta blockade.  On cessation of beta blocker therapy, there is redistribution of catecholamines to beta-adrenergic receptors. $#(Choice C)#  Beta-adrenergic receptors function via cyclic AMP @second messaging@.  The increased stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors following beta blocker cessation leads to increased cyclic AMP activity. $#(Choice D)#  Downregulation of surface membrane receptors occurs when cells are exposed to frequent agonist activity.  For example, prolonged use of an alpha-1 agonist nasal spray (eg, phenylephrine) causes downregulation of alpha-1 receptors and reduced sensitivity to endogenous catecholamines.  This is opposite to what is occurring in this patient. $#Educational objective# When exposed to a prolonged environmental stimulus, cells can adjust their sensitivity to the stimulus by upregulating or downregulating surface membrane receptors.  Prolonged beta blockade leads to upregulation of beta-adrenergic receptors and increased sensitivity to circulating catecholamines, causing an enhanced beta-adrenergic response on abrupt beta blocker cessation (ie, beta blocker withdrawal syndrome).

  "explanation_2": "This patient is exhibiting symptoms consistent with #paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT)#.  As the name implies, PSVT comes on suddenly and the focus of automaticity lies above the ventricles (ie, atria or atrioventricular node).  When due to development of a #reentrant circuit#, the tachyarrhythmia may be terminated by the administration of #adenosine#. $Adenosine is a coronary arteriole vasodilator, but it also affects cardiac conduction.  As an anti-arrhythmic, it acts by hyperpolarizing the nodal pacemaker and conducting cells to briefly #block conduction through the atrioventricular node#.  Its effects are rapid-onset and short-lived (half-life <10 seconds); by temporarily blocking signal conduction from the atria to the ventricles, administration of the drug will often terminate the reentrant circuit and lead to conversion of PSVT to normal sinus rhythm. $The most frequent #adverse effects# associated with adenosine are flushing, chest burning (due to bronchospasm), hypotension, and high-grade atrioventricular block. $#(Choice B)#  Amiodarone (class III anti-arrhythmic) is one of the broadest-spectrum anti-arrhythmic drugs available, and can be used to treat both supraventricular (eg, PSVT, atrial fibrillation) and ventricular arrhythmias.  It has a wide range of adverse effects, including photodermatitis, blue/gray skin discoloration, pulmonary fibrosis, liver toxicity, and hyper- or hypothyroidism. $#(Choice C)#  Digoxin slows conduction through the atrioventricular node and is useful in treating supraventricular tachycardia, especially atrial fibrillation.  It causes a well-characterized toxicity in overdose; symptoms include fatigue, yellow-tinted vision, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, and confusion. $#(Choice D)#  Ibutilide (class III anti-arrhythmic) is used in the treatment of atrial fibrillation and flutter.  Its principal adverse effect is QTc prolongation leading to torsades de pointes. $#(Choice E)#  Lidocaine (class IB anti-arrhythmic) is sometimes used for ventricular arrhythmias but has little utility for supraventricular arrhythmias.  Lidocaine toxicity most commonly causes neurologic symptoms or arrhythmias. $#(Choice F)#  Verapamil (class IV anti-arrhythmic) is the most cardioselective of the calcium channel blockers, and is often used in the treatment of supraventricular tachycardia.  Common adverse reactions noted with verapamil are bradycardia and constipation.

The QT interval represents both ventricular depolarization and repolarization (total duration of ventricular action potential).  However, since ventricular depolarization (QRS duration) contributes only a small amount of time to the interval, the #QT interval# is primarily a measure of #ventricular repolarization#. $Ventricular depolarization occurs due to the opening of #voltage-dependent sodium channels#.

Their moderate potassium channel-blocking activity also causes significant QT interval prolongation. $• Class 1B drugs (eg, lidocaine) have no significant effect on the QRS duration and do not prolong the QT interval due to their rapid dissociation from the receptor. $• Class IC drugs (eg, flecainide, propafenone) are strong sodium channel blockers that prolong QRS duration in a rate-dependent manner.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient's retrosternal chest pain brought on by exertion and relieved with rest is classic for #stable angina#.  It is caused by atherosclerotic narrowing of the coronary arteries such that an adequate increase in myocardial blood flow (and oxygen supply) cannot be achieved to meet the increased myocardial oxygen demand of exercise.  Medical therapy for stable angina is aimed at relieving this #myocardial oxygen supply/demand mismatch#. $#Nitrates# are commonly used to treat stable angina.  Long-acting formulations (eg, isosorbide dinitrate) are used for prevention of stable angina, and short-acting formulations (eg, sublingual nitroglycerin) are used as an abortive agent when symptoms occur.  The primary effect of nitrates is #venodilation#, which causes additional blood to remain in the capacitance veins and reduces venous return to the heart.  The resulting #decrease# in left ventricular (#LV#) #end-diastolic volume# (ie, reduced preload) decreases #LV wall stress# to reduce myocardial #oxygen demand# and relieve angina symptoms. $#(Choice A)#  Decreased heart rate reduces myocardial oxygen demand.  Beta blockers (eg, metoprolol) and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, verapamil) treat stable angina in part via this mechanism, but nitrates have no direct effect on heart rate (and may cause a reflexive increase in heart rate). $#(Choice C)#  Decreased peripheral arteriolar resistance decreases cardiac afterload to reduce LV wall stress and decrease myocardial oxygen demand.  Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, amlodipine) treat stable angina via this mechanism, but nitrates cause only slight peripheral arteriolar vasodilation. $#(Choices D and E)#  Nitrates do stimulate some degree of coronary arteriolar vasodilation, but this mechanism has little effect on relieving angina symptoms.  Coronary arterioles with substantial atherosclerotic disease are already nearly fully dilated at baseline such that the capacity for further dilation to recruit additional blood flow is minimal.  Nitrates can also slightly augment the coronary perfusion pressure gradient (ie, aortic diastolic pressure − LV diastolic pressure) by decreasing LV end-diastolic volume.  This may slightly increase coronary blood flow and myocardial oxygen supply, but the reduction in myocardial oxygen demand via decreased LV wall stress is a much larger contributor to relief of angina symptoms. $#Educational objective# Sublingual nitroglycerin is used for rapid symptom relief in patients with stable angina.  The primary anti-ischemic effect of nitrates is mediated by venodilation causing a decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic volume and wall stress, resulting in decreased myocardial oxygen demand.

  "explanation_2": "This patient with episodes of #recurrent chest discomfort# that spontaneously #resolve within 10-15 minutes# most likely has #vasospastic angina# (formerly called Prinzmetal angina).  It results from coronary #endothelial dysfunction# and autonomic imbalance that lead to #intermittent coronary vasospasm# and #myocardial ischemia#.  Affected patients are usually young (eg, age <50) and lack typical risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) (eg, hypertension, diabetes mellitus); however, #smoking# is a strong risk factor, likely because it contributes to endothelial dysfunction. $Symptoms of vasospastic angina are thought to be triggered by #excess vagal tone#, and they occur most commonly #at night# when vagal tone is at a peak.  The diagnosis is made by ambulatory ECG demonstrating ST-segment elevation during an episode of chest discomfort and coronary angiography revealing an absence of obstructive atherosclerotic CAD.  Because of the pathophysiology of the disorder, both #acetylcholine# and #ergot alkaloids# (eg, dihydroergotamine) provoke symptoms and may also aid in diagnosis, as follows: $• Acetylcholine normally stimulates endothelial muscarinic receptors to cause vasodilation via increased release of nitric oxide.  However, a #deficiency of endothelial nitric oxide# in affected patients causes increased vagal tone to instead trigger #vasoconstriction# and precipitate vasospastic symptoms. $• Ergot alkaloids activate 5-HT2 serotonergic receptors to cause vasoconstriction.  Normally, the vasoconstriction is somewhat offset by endothelial release of vasodilatory prostaglandins, but this response is lacking in affected patients due to endothelial dysfunction. $#(Choices A and C)#  Peripheral endothelial function is typically intact in patients with vasospastic angina.  As a result, acetylcholine is expected to cause peripheral vasodilation, which decreases venous return (due to venodilation).  Systemic vascular resistance is also decreased, which can lower systemic blood pressure and somewhat reduce coronary artery perfusion pressure.  However, this is unlikely to cause myocardial ischemia in the absence of obstructive CAD. $#(Choice D)#  Acetylcholine has a negative inotropic effect, reducing cardiac contractility and myocardial oxygen demand. $#(Choice E)#  Increased heart rate can increase myocardial oxygen demand and may exacerbate angina symptoms in patients with obstructive CAD, but it is unlikely to cause myocardial ischemia in the absence of CAD.  In addition, acetylcholine directly slows heart rate, counteracting any reflex tachycardia caused by peripheral vasodilation. $#Educational objective# Vasospastic angina is the result of intermittent coronary vasospasm caused by endothelial dysfunction and autonomic imbalance.  Although acetylcholine normally stimulates vasodilation, it triggers coronary vasospasm in affected patients due to a deficiency of vasodilatory endothelial nitric oxide.  "

Pharmacologic nitrates (eg, nitroglycerin, isosorbide mononitrate, isosorbide dinitrate) are metabolized to #nitric oxide and S-nitrosothiols# via mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase within vascular smooth muscle cells.  These compounds in turn activate guanylate cyclase and promote the conversion of guanosine triphosphate to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which leads to @dephosphorylation@ of myosin light chains and causes vascular smooth muscle relaxation. $Nitrates predominantly affect the #large veins#, where smooth muscle relaxation leads to #venodilation# and increased venous capacitance.  Cardiac venous return #(preload) is reduced#, leading to a reduction in left ventricular end-diastolic volume and pressure and a consequent decrease in left ventricular wall stress.  #Decreased myocardial oxygen demand# leads to relief of anginal symptoms. $#(Choice A)#  Both beta blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, verapamil) are negative inotropic and chronotropic agents.  They exert antianginal effects via direct actions on cardiac myocytes to reduce myocardial contractility and heart rate, and thereby decrease myocardial oxygen demand.  Nitrates have no direct effect on cardiac myocytes. $#(Choice B)#  Sodium nitroprusside generates nitric oxide while in the bloodstream (rather than within vascular smooth muscle cells) and is much less selective for the large veins than nitrates.  It causes relatively balanced vasodilation of both the large arteries and veins, and is useful for reducing blood pressure in patients with hypertensive emergency. $#(Choice D)#  Precapillary sphincters are bands of smooth muscle that regulate blood flow from arterioles into mesenteric capillary beds.  The effect of nitrates on precapillary sphincters is minimal compared to that on the large veins. $#(Choice E)#  Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, nifedipine, amlodipine, nicardipine) block L-type calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle cells to trigger vasodilation.  This effect is exerted on small arteries and arterioles in both the peripheral and coronary circulation, resulting in 2 therapeutic effects on stable angina.  The peripheral vasodilation reduces afterload leading to a decrease in cardiac work and myocardial oxygen demand, and the coronary vasodilation increases myocardial oxygen supply. $#Educational objective# Pharmacologic nitrates (eg, nitroglycerin, isosorbide mononitrate, isosorbide dinitrate) are metabolized to nitric oxide and S-nitrothiols in vascular smooth muscle cells, leading to an increase in cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) that stimulates vasodilation.

  "explanation_2": "This patient's syncopal episodes are due to bradycardia and decreased peripheral vascular resistance caused by #clonidine#.  Clonidine is used in the treatment of severe or refractory hypertension.  It exerts its effects on both heart rate and blood pressure by #stimulating presynaptic alpha-2 adrenergic receptors# in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (area responsible for basal and reflex control of sympathetic activity).  This effect results in a subsequent #decrease in presynaptic release of norepinephrine# and decreased sympathetic outflow causing both #bradycardia# and a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance. $Normally, to maintain cerebral perfusion while standing, a baroreceptor-mediated @increase in sympathetic drive@ causes vasoconstriction to increase peripheral resistance and increased heart rate and contractility to aid cardiac output.  These changes facilitate a corrective increase in blood pressure to prevent a drop in cerebral perfusion.  However, when an orthostatic stress is applied (eg, upright posture) to this patient with #attenuated sympathetic outflow# due to clonidine, she is unable to maintain cerebral perfusion and syncope results. $Lisinopril and amlodipine can also contribute to orthostatic syncope by impairing peripheral vasoconstriction, but their effects are not as profound as those of clonidine because they do not affect heart rate; in fact, they may result in reflex tachycardia. $#(Choice A)#  Decreased presynaptic release of acetylcholine occurs with certain toxins (eg, botulinum) and some medications (eg, aminoglycoside antibiotics).  This effect leads to muscle weakness and does not contribute to syncope. $#(Choice C)#  Beta blockers (eg, atenolol) block beta-1 adrenoreceptors in the sinoatrial node, which can lead to bradycardia and contribute to orthostatic syncope.  Clonidine does not block adrenoreceptors; it reduces central sympathetic output. $#(Choice D)#  Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, diltiazem, verapamil) block calcium channels in the atrioventricular node and ventricular myocardium, resulting in slowed cardiac conduction (ie, heart rate) and decreased contractility, which can contribute to orthostatic syncope.  Amlodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, has minimal effect on the heart and functions primarily as a direct vasodilator. $#(Choice E)#  Class III antiarrhythmics (eg, dofetilide) bind to and block the potassium channels responsible for phase 3 repolarization of the cardiac action potential.  This effect does not contribute to orthostatic syncope, but it can prolong the QT interval and increase the risk of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (ie, torsade de pointes), a serious cause of cardiac syncope. $#Educational objective# Clonidine, an antihypertensive agent, stimulates central alpha-2 adrenergic receptors, causing a decrease in presynaptic release of norepinephrine and a decrease in sympathetic outflow.

These reflexive changes slightly attenuate the initial increase in blood pressure and lead to overall reduced cardiac output. $#(Choices A and D)#  Dobutamine is primarily a beta-1 agonist with partial activity on beta-2 receptors and minimal effect on alpha receptors.  It increases heart rate and myocardial contractility (via beta-1 stimulation) and causes mild vasodilation (via beta-2 stimulation) to decrease SVR.  Milrinone is not an adrenergic agonist, but it inhibits phosphodiesterase 3 to increase myocardial contractility and cause peripheral vasodilation (decreases SVR).

Administration of these agents leads to breakdown of fibrin clot and often restoration of myocardial perfusion; some patients develop a self-limiting reperfusion-related arrhythmia (most commonly an accelerated idioventricular rhythm). $In the #fibrinolytic pathway#, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is released by the endothelium and cleaves plasminogen to form plasmin.

These drugs are used together in acute STEMI to prevent the development of additional platelet thrombus; however, they do not cause lysis of existing thrombus. $#(Choice E)#  Heparin potentiates the activity of antithrombin III to inhibit thrombin and factor Xa and exert an anticoagulation effect.  Heparin is used in acute STEMI to prevent further progression of clot formation, but it does not cause thrombolysis. $#(Choice G)#  Statins (eg, rosuvastatin) are used for acute STEMI as they may stabilize atherosclerotic plaques, reduce vascular inflammation, and promote long-term regression of atherosclerosis.

Renin release is stimulated by decreased sodium delivery to the distal tubule, low blood pressure (eg, low intravascular volume), and β1 sympathetic activity.  Renin converts angiotensinogen to angiotensin I.  Angiotensin I is then converted to angiotensin II by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which also degrades bradykinin.  Angiotensin II stimulates the #type 1 angiotensin II receptors# found on vascular smooth muscle (causing vasoconstriction) and the adrenal cortex (stimulating aldosterone secretion).  Systemic vasoconstriction and increased aldosterone-induced sodium reabsorption raise blood pressure, inhibiting further renin release from the kidneys (negative feedback). $#Angiotensin II receptor blockers# (ARBs) such as losartan competitively bind to angiotensin II receptors and block the effects of angiotensin II, resulting in #vascular smooth muscle relaxation# and #decreased aldosterone# secretion.  This reduces blood pressure, stimulating renal renin production, which in turn increases conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II.  Because ACE function remains intact with the use of ARBs, bradykinin levels are not significantly affected.  This is in contrast to ACE inhibitors, which lower angiotensin II and aldosterone levels but increase bradykinin levels #(choice C).#  Bradykinin is thought to increase prostaglandin production, which induces coughing due to bronchial irritation. $#(Choice A)#  β1 adrenergic blockers would inhibit renin release from the juxtaglomerular apparatus, thereby suppressing the entire renin-angiotensin cascade (although lowering of the blood pressure would somewhat blunt this response).  ACE activity is not regulated by renin, and so bradykinin levels are unchanged. $#(Choice B)#  Direct renin inhibitors reduce plasma renin activity, which reduces levels of all downstream hormones.  Suppression of the whole cascade lowers blood pressure, which would stimulate increased renin production.  Plasma renin activity, however, is inhibited. $#(Choice E)#  This combination of changes is seen with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (eg, spironolactone) or diuretic use.  Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists block aldosterone activity by binding to the mineralocorticoid receptor.  Diuretics would cause a fall in blood pressure, stimulating the RAAS and increasing blood levels of all hormones. $#Educational objective# Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) work by blocking angiotensin II type 1 receptors, inhibiting the effects of angiotensin II.  This results in arterial vasodilation and decreased aldosterone secretion.  The resulting fall in blood pressure increases renin, angiotensin I, and angiotensin II levels.  ARBs do not affect the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme, and therefore they do not affect bradykinin degradation and do not cause cough.  "

Because vasodilatory nitrates (eg, nitroglycerin, isosorbide mononitrate) work by releasing NO, coadministration of sildenafil with nitrates can lead to excessive cGMP-induced vasodilation and severe hypotension. $#(Choice A)#  1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol is the active form of vitamin D; it is a sterol vitamin that freely crosses cell membranes and interacts with a receptor that primarily resides in the nucleus. $#(Choice C)#  Gamma-aminobutyric acid is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that acts to hyperpolarize nerve cells by binding ligand-gated ion channels or metabotropic receptors. $#(Choice D)#  The insulin receptor consists of 2 alpha and 2 beta subunits.  The alpha subunits are extracellular and provide the binding site for insulin.  The beta subunits are intracellular and contain tyrosine kinase domains. $#(Choice E)#  Interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor is a transmembrane protein complex that acts via a multipathway system, including a JAK-STAT signaling component, a MAP kinase pathway, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase. $#(Choice F)#  Platelet-derived growth factor stimulates cell growth and division, including angiogenesis.  It acts via a tyrosine kinase receptor. $#Educational objective# Atrial natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide, and nitric oxide activate guanylyl cyclase and increase conversion of guanosine 5′-triphosphate to cyclic guanosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cGMP).  Phosphodiesterase inhibitors (eg, sildenafil) decrease the degradation of cGMP.  Elevated intracellular cGMP levels lead to relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and vasodilation.  "

HDL is involved in reverse cholesterol transport; it helps to remove cholesterol from peripheral tissues and transports it to the liver for metabolism.  This is accomplished through 2 different pathways.  In the direct pathway, HDL delivers cholesterol esters directly to the liver via a scavenger receptor (SCARB1) on the hepatocyte cell membrane.  In the indirect pathway, the cholesterol in HDL is transferred to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) by the cholesteryl ester transfer protein. $Nonpharmacologic measures such as exercise, weight loss, and smoking cessation help to raise HDL levels and have significant cardiovascular benefits.  In contrast, use of medications to raise HDL levels does #not# improve cardiovascular outcomes.

Bile acid binding resins can significantly increase triglyceride levels in patients with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia.  In addition, cationic exchange resins have not been proven to prevent cardiac events. $#(Choice D)#  Omega-3 essential fatty acids are sometimes used for hyperlipidemia treatment.  They cause a decrease in serum triglycerides and a slight increase in HDL concentration but do not appear to significantly reduce cardiovascular events. $#(Choice E)#  Niacin (vitamin B3) given in pharmacologic doses is the most effective agent for raising HDL levels, but does not reduce the risk of cardiovascular events and is associated with adverse effects (eg, flushing, hyperglycemia).  It is primarily used for patients who have failed other lipid-lowering drugs. $#(Choice F)#  Fibrates activate peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor alpha, a transcription factor that increases lipoprotein lipase activity.

As a result, CoNS are a major cause of infection in patients with indwelling catheters or implanted foreign bodies (eg, peritoneal dialysis catheters, vascular grafts) and a common cause of prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE).  For example, Staphylococcus epidermidis (a type of CoNS) can cause an indolent endocarditis following valve replacement; if left untreated, it can lead to intracardiac abscess, prosthetic valve dehiscence, and septic embolization.  As CoNS are a component of normal skin flora, it may be difficult initially to distinguish blood culture contamination from true infection; however, recovery of the same organism from several blood culture bottles indicates infection. $Most (>80%) CoNS strains are methicillin-resistant.  Therefore, particularly with nosocomial infection (as is likely in this patient), CoNS should be assumed to be #methicillin-resistant# until proven otherwise.  #Vancomycin# should be a component of initial therapy.

They inhibit the L-type calcium channel on vascular smooth muscle and cardiac cells and are divided into 2 major categories based on their predominant actions:  $1. #Dihydropyridines# (nifedipine, amlodipine, felodipine) primarily affect #arterial smooth muscle#, causing vasodilation with little or no effect on cardiac conduction or contractility.  $2. #Nondihydropyridines# (verapamil, diltiazem) affect the #myocardium#, slowing heart rate (negative chronotropic effect) and reducing contractility (negative inotropic effect). $This patient's ECG shows sinus bradycardia (rate <60/min) with first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block (PR interval >200 msec).  Of the choices above, nifedipine is the most appropriate agent to manage hypertension as it has minimal effect on cardiac conduction.  Dihydropyridines can cause reflex tachycardia in response to peripheral vasodilation and are therefore useful in hypertensive patients with resting bradycardia. $#(Choices A and E)#  Verapamil is a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker with a significant depressive effect on cardiac conduction.  Diltiazem has combined effects and acts at both the myocardium and peripheral arterial beds.  These medications can worsen bradycardia and AV block and should not be used in patients with underlying conduction abnormalities. $#(Choices B and D)#  Metoprolol is a cardioselective beta blocker with negative chronotropic and dromotropic (decreased AV conduction) effects.  Sotalol is a class III antiarrhythmic drug with significant beta-blocking properties.  These drugs can worsen bradycardia and AV conduction defects and would not be recommended for this patient. $#Educational objective# Calcium channel blockers inhibit the L-type calcium channel on vascular smooth muscle and cardiac cells.  Dihydropyridines (eg, nifedipine, amlodipine) primarily affect peripheral arteries and cause vasodilation.  Nondihydropyridines (eg, verapamil, diltiazem) affect the myocardium and can cause bradycardia and slowed atrioventricular conduction.  "

  "explanation_2": "Around-the-clock nitrate administration (in any form) rapidly results in development of tolerance to nitrates.  This is why a nitrate-free interval must be provided every day in patients that are using daily long acting nitrates.  The mechanism by which this occurs has not been fully demonstrated, but it is theorized that it is due to a decreased vascular sensitivity to nitrates and an increased sensitivity to endogenous vasoconstricting agents.  Usually the nitrate-free period is timed to occur during the night when the patient is sleeping and cardiac work is the least. $#(Choice A)#  A pharmacokinetic drug interaction refers to how drugs that are used together in a patient affect the absorption and elimination of each other.  An example of this is the ability of rifampin to increase the metabolism and elimination of warfarin by inducing cytochrome P-450.  This is not the reason for providing a nitrate-free interval. $#(Choice B)#  Pharmacodynamic drug antagonism refers to the ability of a drug, as part of its mechanism of action, to antagonize, or prevent, the effect of another drug or endogenous substance.  An example of this is the effect that labetalol has on alpha-1 and beta adrenergic receptors – it prevents the binding of catecholamines to these receptors. $#(Choice C)#  Effect potentiation refers to one drug's ability to increase the pharmacologic effect of another agent.  The drugs mentioned in this question stem do not potentiate the effects of each other, and this is not the reason for providing a nitrate-free period.  Beta-adrenergic blockers are often prescribed along with nitrates to prevent reflex tachycardia as well as to provide decreased cardiac work by a mechanism different from that of nitrates. $#(Choice E)#  Withdrawal symptoms occur when a patient forms a physiologic dependence on a drug or medication and that drug or medication is then discontinued.  This is common in patients using alcohol, opiates, benzodiazepines, stimulants and some antidepressants.  This is not the reason for providing a nitrate-free period in patients taking nitrates. $#(Choice F)#  Drug noncompliance is a problem where patients do not take the medications prescribed to them properly or at all.  It is frequent among patients who do not understand their disease, can not afford medications, or simply can not remember to take them.  The latter becomes much more frequent when patients are taking multiple medications with many times-per-day dosing schedules.  This is also not the reason for providing a nitrate-free period every day in patients taking long-term nitrates. $#Educational objective# Patients taking daily maintenance nitrates need to have a nitrate-free period every day to avoid tolerance to the drug.

  "explanation_2": "This patient most likely has #QT interval prolongation#, a common adverse effect of #methadone#.  QT interval prolongation is the ECG manifestation of @delayed ventricular repolarization@, which occurs due to impairment of the voltage-gated potassium channels that control the delayed rectifier potassium current.  Significant slowing of ventricular repolarization can trigger #torsade de pointes# (TdP), a form of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia named for a repetitive \"@twisting of the peaks@\" pattern.  TdP is a serious arrhythmia that can cause palpitations, lightheadedness, #syncope#, and sudden cardiac death (SCD). $Many #medications#, including methadone, are known to #inhibit the delayed rectifier potassium current# to prolong the QT interval and predispose to TdP.  Methadone undergoes slow and variable hepatic clearance, making consistent avoidance of toxic blood levels challenging; therefore, the use of high doses of methadone increases the risk of QT interval prolongation and TdP. $#(Choice A)#  Advanced atrioventricular block (ie, Mobitz type II or @complete atrioventricular block@) can present with syncope.  Common causes include infection (eg, Lyme disease), ischemia, and medications (eg, beta blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers).  Methadone is not associated with atrioventricular block. $#(Choice B)#  Deep Q waves on ECG typically represent a previous myocardial infarction (MI).  Patients with a history of MI are at risk for @monomorphic ventricular tachycardia@ causing syncope or SCD, but a prior MI is unlikely in this relatively young patient without significant cardiovascular risk factors (eg, hypertension, smoking, family history). $#(Choice D)#  @Sinus pauses@ occur with sick sinus syndrome, which most commonly results from age-related degeneration of the conduction system.  Affected patients are usually age >65 and may experience progressive fatigue and episodes of syncope. $#(Choice E)#  Ventricular preexcitation is recognized by a slurred upslope of the QRS complex (@delta wave@) on ECG.  Patients with this characteristic Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) pattern may develop paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (ie, @WPW syndrome@), which can present with syncope or SCD.  However, the onset of WPW syndrome is usually age <40, and this patient's methadone use makes a prolonged QT interval more likely. $#Educational objective# Methadone slows the delayed rectifier potassium current responsible for ventricular repolarization, and high doses are associated with QT interval prolongation.  QT interval prolongation predisposes to the development of torsade de pointes, a serious ventricular arrhythmia that can cause syncope and sudden cardiac death.  ",

However, this patient's QRS duration is normal at rest and prolonged at near-maximal heart rate.  This suggests that the drug used to treat his atrial fibrillation lengthens the QRS duration in a rate-dependent manner, which is consistent with a drug exhibiting strong use-dependence such as flecainide. $#Flecainide# is a @class 1C antiarrhythmic@ that is typically used to treat supraventricular tachycardias such as those caused by atrial fibrillation.

This #prolongs the QRS duration# with little effect on total action potential or QT interval duration.  Class 1C drugs are the slowest of the class 1 agents to dissociate from the sodium channel, and do so primarily during diastole.  This results in a phenomenon known as #use-dependence#, in which their sodium-blocking effects intensify as the heart rate increases due to less time for the medication to dissociate from the receptor. $#(Choice A)#  Selective β1 blockers such as atenolol do not significantly affect QRS duration.  However, their use during exercise ECG testing can limit the maximal heart rate that is achieved. $#(Choice B)#  Digoxin can cause false-positive ST-segment depression during exercise ECG testing as well as lower the maximal achievable heart rate.  It does not significantly affect QRS duration. $#(Choice C)#  Dofetilide is a class III antiarrhythmic drug that blocks the outward potassium current during repolarization.

Class III agents demonstrate reverse use-dependence (the slower the heart rate, the more the QT interval is prolonged). $#(Choice E)#  Verapamil (a class IV antiarrhythmic) is a calcium channel blocker that slows sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodal conduction.  It also increases coronary blood flow and reduces myocardial oxygen demand, which can mask ischemia during stress testing.  Verapamil does not affect QRS duration. $#Educational objective# Class 1C antiarrhythmics such as flecainide are potent sodium channel blockers that have increased effect at faster heart rates (use-dependence).

Nitrates are converted to nitric oxide by vascular smooth muscle cells, and nitric oxide causes increased intracellular cGMP as a second-messenger.  Increased cGMP concentration leads to vascular smooth muscle relaxation.  Additionally, cGMP is metabolized within the cells by phosphodiesterase, and phosphodiesterase inhibitors will lead to increased intracellular cGMP.  cGMP accumulation in vascular smooth muscle cells due to both enhanced synthesis (nitrates) and inhibited degradation (PDE inhibitors) is responsible for profound hypotension due to extreme vasodilatation when these drugs are used together. $#(Choice A)#  Receptor downregulation or tachyphylaxis occurs with many drug classes including topical glucocorticoids, opiates, L-dopa and more.  It is one mechanism by which the body develops tolerance to drugs on a cellular level, but it is not the cause of hypotension in this patient who took nitrates together with a PDE inhibitor. $#(Choice B)#  Gs protein phosphorylation leads to activation of the Gs protein, a stimulatory protein which acts as a part of the adenylate cyclase second messenger system.  It has no role in cGMP pathways that are affected by nitrates and PDE inhibitors. $#(Choice D)#  Tyrosine kinase overactivity would lead to an exaggeration of the effects of insulin or insulin-like growth factor.  Tyrosine kinase has no role in the effect of nitrates or PDE inhibitors on vascular smooth muscle. $#(Choice E)#  Enhanced phospholipid metabolism would lead to an increase in the production of prostaglandins (via diacylglycerol) and inositol triphosphate (leading to calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum).  This is the inositol triphosphate second-messenger system, and it mediates the effects of alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, angiotensin II receptors, oxytocin receptors and vascular vasopressin receptors.  It is not involved in the action of nitrates or PDE inhibitors. $#(Choice F)#  Tolerance refers to the need for a larger dose of drug to achieve the same clinical effect achieved previously with a smaller dose of drug.  Development of tolerance can occur by multiple mechanisms such as a change in cellular response to drug (decreased receptors, decreased response to receptor stimulation), as well as increased rate of drug elimination by the body.  Tolerance is not the reason for this patient to experience hypotension with this drug combination. $#Educational objective# Using nitrates together with phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors used for erectile dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension causes a profound systemic hypotension because they both increase intracellular cGMP which causes vascular smooth muscle relaxation.  Their use together is absolutely contraindicated.  "

Nitrates must be avoided in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (due to increased outflow tract obstruction), right ventricular infarction (due to reduction in preload, impairing cardiac output), and those on phosphodiesterase inhibitors (synergism increases the risk of severe hypotension). $#(Choice A)#  Atrioventricular conduction delay is a potential adverse effect of several drugs used for management of chronic stable angina.  These include calcium channel blockers (eg, verapamil, diltiazem) and beta blockers (eg, metoprolol, propranolol). $#(Choice B)#  Cold extremities due to Raynaud phenomenon are associated with medications such as amphetamines, ergotamine, and chemotherapeutic agents. $#(Choice C)#  Constipation is a common side effect of opioid analgesics, iron supplements, calcium channel blockers such as verapamil, and anticholinergic medications such as atropine. $#(Choice D)#  Thiazide diuretics can lead to hyperuricemia and precipitate an acute gout attack. $#(Choice E)#  Nocturnal wheezing can be a symptom of asthma or gastroesophageal reflux disease.  In addition, the use of beta blockers in patients with underlying bronchospastic disease can cause increased bronchoconstriction and lead to wheezing. $#(Choice G)#  Urinary retention is typically associated with medications that exhibit anticholinergic properties such as tricyclic antidepressants (eg, amitriptyline) and antihistamines (eg, diphenhydramine). $#Educational objective# The main adverse effects seen with nitrate therapy include headaches and cutaneous flushing along with lightheadedness and hypotension due to systemic vasodilation.

  "explanation_2": "$The typical myocardial action potential of \"nonpacemaker\" or cardiac myocytes includes several phases:  $1. #Phase 0 (rapid depolarization)# – occurs when the resting membrane potential reaches threshold; it is characterized by rapid sodium entry into the cell due to activation and opening of voltage-dependent sodium channels.  Class I antiarrhythmic drugs (eg, procainamide#,# flecainide, lidocaine) block these sodium channels and inhibit the initial depolarization phase (phase 0) of the action potential.  $2. #Phase 1 (early repolarization)# – caused primarily by activation of transient outward potassium currents along with a rapid decline in inward sodium current.  This phase is not modulated to an appreciable extent by antiarrhythmic medications.  $3. #Phase 2 (plateau phase)# – Stable membrane potential due to a balance of \"late\" inward calcium current and outward potassium current.  Calcium channel blockers (verapamil, diltiazem) are class IV antiarrhythmic drugs that inhibit the L-type calcium channels during this phase.  These medications slow the sinus rate, prolong conduction through the atrioventricular node, and depress myocardial contractility (negative inotropic effect).  $4. #Phase 3 (late repolarization)# – characterized by the opening of #potassium channels# and the efflux of potassium ions from the cell (delayed rectifier potassium currents IKr and IKs) in conjunction with the decay of inward calcium current.  #Class III# antiarrhythmic drugs (#amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide#) predominantly block potassium channels and inhibit the outward potassium current during this phase, leading to prolongation of repolarization, action potential duration, and the QT interval on ECG.  These medications are often used for #maintenance of sinus rhythm# in patients with #paroxysmal atrial fibrillation#.  $5. #Phase 4 (recovery)# – normal resting membrane potential is between −80 and −95 mV and is generated by open potassium channels (inward rectifier current).  Antiarrhythmic drugs do not affect phase 4 of the myocyte action potential, but beta blockers and calcium channel blockers can slow diastolic depolarization (phases 4 and 0) in pacemaker cells by decreasing the slope of depolarization. $#Educational objective# Class III antiarrhythmic drugs (amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide) predominantly block potassium channels and inhibit the outward potassium currents during phase 3 of the cardiac action potential, thereby prolonging repolarization and total action potential duration.

Gas is insufflated to allow better visualization and easier access to organs while operating.  Difficulty maintaining abdominal insufflation due to muscle contraction is often caused by insufficient doses of paralytic agents.  However, if the patient has been appropriately medicated, sustained muscle contraction, especially when widespread, may be due to #malignant hyperthermia# (MH). $MH is often due to abnormal ryanodine receptors (RYR1) in the skeletal muscle.  On exposure to certain anesthetic agents (typically succinylcholine and inhalational gases), these abnormal receptors allow the unregulated passage of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the intracellular space.  As a result of excessive calcium accumulation, patients develop sudden-onset, #widespread muscle rigidity#.  Sustained muscle contraction #produces excessive CO2#, leading to hypercarbia and acidosis; depletes cellular oxygen, leading to lactic acid production; and causes #muscle breakdown#, leading to rhabdomyolysis.  #Hyperthermia# is often a later clinical sign that develops as the increased cellular metabolism overwhelms the body's ability to dissipate heat. $Many pharmacologic muscle relaxants work upstream from the pathologic process of excessive calcium release and are therefore ineffective during an acute MH crisis.  #Dantrolene# is used to treat MH because it directly #inhibits intracellular calcium release# from the abnormal ryanodine receptor (RYR1). $#(Choice A)#  Neostigmine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that prevents the degradation of acetylcholine in the neuromuscular junction.  Therefore, it could increase, rather than decrease, the strength of muscle contractions. $#(Choice B)#  Alpha-adrenergic antagonists (eg, phentolamine, phenoxybenzamine) inhibit alpha-receptor–mediated sympathetic activity.  They are used primarily to lower blood pressure by decreasing vascular tone; they have minimal effect on skeletal muscle. $#(Choices C and D)#  Baclofen is a GABA-B agonist that increases neuron hyperpolarization in the CNS to relax muscles.  Nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (eg, rocuronium) are nicotinic receptor antagonists that inhibit the action of acetylcholine at the motor endplate.  Both agents work upstream from intracellular calcium release and therefore have minimal impact on muscle contraction during an MH crisis. $#Educational objective# Malignant hyperthermia presents with widespread muscle rigidity after administration of inhalation anesthetics and/or succinylcholine to genetically susceptible individuals.  It is treated with dantrolene, which blocks ryanodine receptors to prevent the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytoplasm of skeletal muscle fibers.  "

  "explanation_1": "Before gas anesthetics can reach the target organ (brain), they must move through a number of compartments (inhaled air → lungs → blood→ brain).  The onset of anesthesia occurs when a sufficient quantity of anesthetic is transferred to the brain.  The factors shown in the table influence the rate of transfer of anesthetic through the compartments and determine the onset of action.",
  "explanation_2": "The arteriovenous concentration gradient is the difference between the concentration of a gas anesthetic in arterial and venous blood.  The solubility of the anesthetic in the peripheral tissues is a major factor in determining the size of the arteriovenous gradient.  If tissue solubility is high, a large amount of anesthetic is taken up from arterial blood, which results in low venous concentration.  As a result, saturation of the blood requires further absorption of anesthetic in order to replace that which is absorbed by the peripheral tissues.  Because blood saturation takes longer, brain saturation is also delayed and onset of action is slower. $In contrast, anesthetic gases with low peripheral tissue solubility have smaller arteriovenous gradients as there is less peripheral tissue uptake #(choices B and C)#.  Less anesthetic is required to replace the amount absorbed by the peripheral tissue and so blood saturation occurs quickly, allowing concentrations in the brain to equilibrate faster #(choice A).# $#(Choice D)#  Potency of the anesthetic is defined by the minimal alveolar concentration (MAC), the alveolar concentration that prevents movement in 50% of patients exposed to noxious stimuli.  Potent anesthetics have low MACs.  The arteriovenous concentration gradient influences the rate of induction, not anesthetic potency. $#Educational objective# The arteriovenous concentration gradient reflects the overall tissue solubility of an anesthetic.  Anesthetics with high tissue solubility are characterized by large arteriovenous concentration gradients and slower onsets of action.  "

  "explanation_2": "The potency of an inhaled anesthetic is determined by the minimum concentration in the brain necessary to achieve an adequate level of anesthesia.  When an inhaled anesthetic is administered at a constant rate over a prolonged period of time, its partial pressure in the brain equals its partial pressure in the other compartments (inhaled air, lungs, and arterial blood).  Since an anesthetic's concentration in the brain tissue is directly proportional to its partial pressure, it is possible to use the steady-state alveolar partial pressure of the inhaled agent as a measure of anesthetic potency. $The minimal alveolar concentration (MAC) refers to the percentage of anesthetic in the inspired gas mixture that renders 50% of patients unresponsive to painful stimuli.  It corresponds to ED₅₀ on the dose-effect curve.  Potency is inversely proportional to the MAC: the lower the MAC, the more potent the anesthetic.  MAC is an intrinsic property of the anesthetic that does not depend on the type of surgery; duration of anesthesia; or the sex, height, and weight of the patient.  It does, however, depend on body temperature and also decreases with increasing patient age. $#(Choice A)#  The arteriovenous concentration gradient is an indirect measurement of the solubility of the anesthetic in body tissues.  A high arteriovenous concentration gradient means that more anesthetic is extracted from the blood by the body tissues, increasing the time it takes for the blood to become saturated and slowing the onset of action. $#(Choice B)#  The blood/gas partition coefficient corresponds to the solubility of anesthetic in the blood.  Anesthetics with a high blood/gas partition coefficient are absorbed to a greater extent by the blood and have a slower onset of action. $#(Choice C)#  Clearance of inhaled anesthetics occurs mainly via exhalation from the lungs into the air; hepatic metabolism of most gas anesthetics is low.  However, certain gas anesthetics, particularly halothane, are metabolized extensively by the liver, resulting in the production of reactive intermediates that cause hepatotoxicity. $#(Choice E)#  The steepness of the arterial tension curve depends on the solubility of the anesthetic in the blood.  Partial pressure in the blood rises more rapidly with less soluble anesthetics, producing a steeper curve. $#Educational objective# The minimal alveolar concentration (MAC) is a measure of potency of an inhaled anesthetic.  It is the concentration of the anesthetic in the alveoli that renders 50% of patients unresponsive to painful stimuli (ED₅₀).  Potency is inversely proportional to the MAC: the lower the MAC, the more potent the anesthetic.  "

Direct dopamine replacement is impossible because dopamine cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, so #levodopa# (ie, L-DOPA), the immediate #precursor of dopamine#, is used.  Once levodopa crosses the BBB, it is taken up by nigrostriatal neurons and converted to therapeutic dopamine in the brain. $Levodopa is rapidly metabolized in the peripheral tissues to dopamine (via aromatic D-amino acid [DOPA] decarboxylase) and 3-O-methyldopa (via #catechol O-methyltransferase [COMT]#).  Therefore, only a small percentage of levodopa reaches the brain.  Both COMT inhibitors (eg, #entacapone#, tolcapone) and DOPA decarboxylase inhibitors (eg, carbidopa) #decrease peripheral levodopa degradation# and increase the amount of levodopa available to cross the blood-brain barrier. $Patients are nearly always prescribed carbidopa with levodopa.  The progression of Parkinson disease leads to an increasingly @narrow therapeutic window@, as seen in this patient with bothersome \"#wearing off#\" periods.

Entacapone has no direct effect on dopamine receptors and does not cross the blood-brain barrier. $#(Choice C)#  Amantadine enhances the effect of endogenous dopamine by increasing dopamine release and inhibiting its reuptake.  It is also thought to cause anticholinergic effects (reduces tremor), as well as antagonism of N-methyl D-aspartate receptors (reduces glutamine-induced neurotoxicity). $#(Choices D and E)#  The dopamine insufficiency of Parkinson disease upsets the normal balance between dopamine and acetylcholine in the basal ganglia, resulting in cholinergic hypersensitivity.  Anticholinergic medications (eg, trihexyphenidyl) counteract this effect by inhibiting central muscarinic receptors.  Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (eg, donepezil, rivastigmine) would increase the amount of acetylcholine in the CNS, which could worsen symptoms of Parkinson disease. $#Educational objective# Parkinson disease is typically treated with levodopa (immediate precursor of dopamine), which crosses the blood-brain barrier.  Levodopa is administered with DOPA decarboxylase inhibitors (eg, carbidopa) and sometimes catechol O-methyltransferase inhibitors (eg, entacapone) to reduce the peripheral metabolism of levodopa, resulting in increased levodopa bioavailability within the brain.

This results in muscle overactivity, leading to increased tone and hyperreflexia. $Enhancement of CNS inhibitory neurotransmitter activity can improve spasticity.  #GABA# is the primary #inhibitory neurotransmitter# in the CNS and acts on two different receptors: $• v#GABA A# receptor mediates a fast response to GABA because it is an ion-gated chloride channel.  Activation of this receptor leads to rapid muscle relaxation and sedation.  Its activity is enhanced by #benzodiazepines#, which can be used to treat spasticity. $• #GABA B# receptor mediates a slower response to GABA because it is mediated by a G protein–coupled receptor that opens potassium channels.  It is agonized by #baclofen#, which can also be used to treat spasticity. $#(Choice A)#  Glutamate is the primary excitatory CNS neurotransmitter; therefore, activation of NMDA glutamate receptors would result in increased excitation and lead to further increases in muscle tone. $#(Choices C and E)#  Dopamine is a modulatory (rather than primarily excitatory or inhibitory) neurotransmitter that affects motor control.  In patients with Parkinson disease who have a relative deficiency of dopamine in the substantia nigra, medications that increase dopaminergic activity (eg, levodopa) can improve muscle rigidity.  In some patients, a relative excess of acetylcholine compared to dopamine has been implicated in the tremor or rigidity associated with Parkinson disease or drug-induced parkinsonism.  In these patients, anticholinergic medications (eg, trihexyphenidyl) are sometimes used. $#(Choice D)#  Glycine is an inhibitory neurotransmitter found primarily in the spinal cord rather than in the brain.  Blockade of glycine receptors (eg, strychnine poisoning) leads to increased muscle contraction. $#Educational objective# Cerebral palsy results in spasticity (eg, hypertonia, hyperreflexia) due to a loss of descending inhibitory control.  Medications used to enhance the activity of GABA, the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter of the CNS, can improve spasticity.  "

  "explanation_2": "$This novel medication that induces hypokalemia while reducing uterine contractions during pregnancy is most likely a #beta-2# adrenergic receptor #agonist#.  Beta-2 receptors are ubiquitously expressed throughout the body, with the lungs and vasculature having the greatest tissue density.  Receptor activation results in #bronchodilation# and #vasodilation# due to smooth muscle relaxation; in addition, beta-2 stimulation can also modulate key functions of other organs (eg, eye, uterus). $Once a fetus grows to a sufficiently large size, myometrial distension signals the maternal hypothalamus to produce and release oxytocin into the bloodstream.  Oxytocin then binds to receptors located on the myometrium, leading to opening of membrane-bound calcium channels and muscular contraction.  In addition, oxytocin binding stimulates the production of prostaglandins (PGE1, PGE2, PGF2α) that also induce contraction #(choice E).#  If contractions begin too early (ie, preterm labor), pregnancy may be prolonged by using inhibitors of uterine contraction (@tocolytics@).  Stimulation of myometrial beta-2 receptors decreases intracellular calcium within myometrial cells, #impairing uterine contraction#. $Beta-2 receptors also regulate activity of the sodium-potassium pump located on all cells.  This pump maintains the resting membrane potential by driving sodium extracellularly and potassium intracellularly.  Overstimulation of beta-2 receptors can lead to significant potassium internalization, resulting in #hypokalemia#. $#(Choices B and D)#  Magnesium sulfate and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) competitively block membrane calcium channels, preventing the influx of calcium needed to stimulate contraction.  Magnesium inhibits renal outer medullary potassium excretion channels in the kidneys, leading to hyperkalemia.  CCBs alone do not alter potassium levels. $#(Choice C)#  Methylergonovine, an ergot alkaloid, is used to increase uterine contractions (uterotonic) through its activity on the 5-HT2A receptor.  It can be used to treat postpartum hemorrhage by stimulating the myometrium to clamp down on uterine vessels. $#Educational objective# Although beta-2 receptors are predominant in the lungs and vasculature, they are also found on all cell membranes, including those of the uterus.  Stimulation of uterine receptors results in smooth muscle relaxation (tocolysis), while stimulation of sodium-potassium ATPase pumps can result in hypokalemia.  ",

Morphine and other commonly used opiates have an especially high affinity for the #mu receptor#, which exerts the strongest analgesic effects. $In the spine, opiates bind to mu receptors on the primary afferent neuron, resulting in closure of voltage-gated calcium channels, #reduced calcium influx#, and decreased excitatory neurotransmitter release (eg, acetylcholine, norepinephrine, serotonin, glutamate, substance P) from the #presynaptic terminal (choice C).#  Opiates also bind to mu receptors on the #postsynaptic membrane#, which opens potassium channels and leads to membrane hyperpolarization due to #potassium efflux#.

Direct dopamine replacement is impossible because dopamine cannot cross the blood-brain barrier.  However, #levodopa# (dopamine's immediate precursor) does cross the BBB where it is taken up by nigrostriatal neurons and converted to therapeutic dopamine by DOPA decarboxylase in the brain. $In the peripheral tissues, levodopa is rapidly metabolized to dopamine (via DOPA decarboxylase) and 3-O-methyldopa (via catechol O-methyltransferase).  #Excessive peripheral dopamine# can lead to unpleasant #adverse effects# (eg, nausea/vomiting, tachyarrhythmias, postural hypotension). $#Carbidopa# blocks DOPA decarboxylase and therefore prevents peripheral conversion of L-DOPA to dopamine.  In addition to increasing the amount of dopamine available to the brain, carbidopa also #decreases# many of the unpleasant adverse effects that occur due to the peripheral effects of dopamine. $However, #anxiety and agitation# are #central effects# of dopamine, so carbidopa does not prevent them.  Anxiety and agitation can actually be increased with the use of carbidopa because more dopamine is available to the brain. $#(Choices B and D)#  Hot flashes and postural hypotension seem to result from the peripheral conversion of levodopa to dopamine, so a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor would decrease these problems. $#(Choice C)#  When levodopa is used without carbidopa, more peripheral dopamine is produced.  The increased dopamine can stimulate the emetic center (ie, area postrema) because, despite its brainstem location, it is uniquely outside the blood-brain barrier.  Therefore, by reducing peripheral dopamine, carbidopa reduces nausea and vomiting from levodopa. $#(Choice E)#  Tachyarrhythmias, such as ventricular extrasystoles and atrial fibrillation, are attributed to the increased peripheral @formation of catecholamines@.  Adding a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor reduces the amount of dopamine available to form catecholamines, so it clinically decreases the risk for tachyarrhythmias. $#Educational objective#  Adding carbidopa can reduce most of the peripheral adverse effects of levodopa.  However, the central effects of dopamine (eg, anxiety, agitation, behavioral changes) from levodopa can worsen with the addition of carbidopa because more dopamine becomes available in the brain.  ",

When administered as an intravenous bolus, its onset of action is approximately 30 seconds with a duration of action typically lasting <10 minutes.  Administration causes a rapid decrease in the level of consciousness as well as a global amnestic effect. $Following bolus infusion, propofol is rapidly cleared from the plasma and #preferentially distributed# to organs receiving #high blood flow# (eg, brain). This initial distribution accounts for the rapid onset of sedation seen with its administration.  Over time, propofol is #redistributed# to organs receiving less blood flow (eg, fat, muscle tissue).  Because the site of action for propofol is the brain, redistribution accounts for the rapid termination of drug action. $#(Choice A)#  Although propofol is metabolized in the liver through hepatic conjugation, its half-life is 4 hours to 1 day; therefore, hepatic metabolism does not occur fast enough to account for such a short duration of action. $#(Choice B)#  Volatile, inhaled anesthetics such as halothane are predominately eliminated by the lungs. $#(Choice C)#  Renal tubular secretion and glomerular filtration are the predominate mechanisms through which water-soluble drugs are eliminated. $#(Choice D)#  Atracurium is a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent that spontaneously degrades in plasma and organ tissue, a type of metabolism known as Hofmann elimination. $#Educational objective# Propofol and other highly lipophilic drugs readily diffuse across membranes, quickly accumulating in tissues receiving high blood flow; this accounts for their rapid onset of action.

This effect is responsible for notable drug interactions due to increased clearance of certain pharmaceutical agents (eg, warfarin). $In addition, these medications, especially phenytoin, induce CYP24 (ie, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-24-hydroxylase), which converts 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (inactive form).  As a result, there is less 25-hydroxyvitamin D available for conversion to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (active form).  #Deficiency of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D# leads to decreased intestinal absorption of calcium.  The resulting compensatory increase in parathyroid hormone secretion causes increased release of calcium from bones and progressive #loss of bone mineral density#. $#(Choice A)#  Vitamin D-binding protein (VDBP) carries a large share of circulating vitamin D metabolites.

However, decreased absorption of vitamin D typically occurs due to fat malabsorption (eg, intestinal or biliopancreatic disease) rather than formation of insoluble complexes. $#(Choice E)#  25-hydroxyvitamin D is converted to active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D by 1-alpha hydroxylase in renal tubular cells.  This enzyme is inhibited by fibroblast growth factor-23, which also increases activity of 24-alpha-hydroxylase (inactivating enzyme).

Local anesthetics have a greater effect on #small myelinated nerves#, so they preferentially inhibit neurons that carry pain and temperature sensation; pressure sensation and motor function are often preserved at typical doses. $Local anesthetics are #weak bases# that exist in charged and uncharged forms.  When in the #uncharged form#, they diffuse through the cell membrane to block sodium channels from the inside of the cell.  Increased acidity in the surrounding tissue, which occurs in infected wounds, results in more anesthetic molecules remaining in the charged form, rendering them unable to penetrate the cell membrane to exert an effect.  Therefore, the dose required to achieve adequate anesthesia is higher in infected tissue. $#(Choice A)#  Blockade of potassium channels would inhibit repolarization, thereby prolonging action potentials and increasing neurotransmitter release at the neuromuscular junction rather than halting action potential propagation. $#(Choice C)#  Decreased calcium current slows the action potential propagation in cells that rely primarily on voltage-gated calcium channels for depolarization, such as cardiac slow response tissues (eg, sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes); peripheral nerve depolarization is driven primarily by sodium, rather than calcium, influx. $#(Choice D)#  GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS.  Activation of the GABA-A receptor, which is the target of some sedating medications (eg, benzodiazepines), activates voltage-gated chloride channels.  The influx of chloride ions causes hyperpolarization, which inhibits action potentials. $#(Choice E)#  Interruption of axonal transport delays the delivery of organelles (eg, mitochondria) and synaptic vesicles to the distal axon, causing impaired nerve impulse propagation.  This occurs in some neurodegenerative diseases (eg, sporadic Alzheimer) or as an adverse effect of some chemotherapeutic agents (eg, vincristine). $#Educational objective#Local anesthetics diffuse through the neuronal cell membrane to block the influx of sodium into the cell.

  "explanation_img": "",

  "explanation_2": "Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular-blocking agent that, like acetylcholine, attaches to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and depolarizes the neuromuscular end plate.  Unlike acetylcholine, succinylcholine is not degraded by acetylcholinesterase, resulting in continuous stimulation of the endplate (reflected by initial transient fasciculations).  However, the sodium channels surrounding the end plate rapidly become inactivated and cannot reopen until the end plate is repolarized.  Thus, succinylcholine-induced depolarization remains isolated to the end plate, resulting in development of a flaccid paralysis (#phase 1 block#).  Eventually, with continued administration of succinylcholine, the continuous depolarization of the endplate gives way to gradual repolarization as the nAChR becomes desensitized to the effects of succinylcholine.  This is termed #phase II block# and is similar to non-depolarizing blockade. $Because the nAChR is a nonselective cation channel, its opening not only allows sodium influx but also potassium release.  Exaggerated hyperkalemia and life-threatening arrhythmias can occur in patients with crush or burn injuries, denervating injuries or diseases (eg, quadriplegia and Guillain-Barré syndrome), and myopathies.  These pathologic states cause up-regulation of muscle nAChRs and/or rhabdomyolysis, which can result in the release of large amounts of potassium when succinylcholine is administered.  In these patients, non-depolarizing agents such as vecuronium or rocuronium are better choices #(choice E)#. $#(Choice A)#  The nondepolarizing neuromuscular-blocking agent atracurium releases histamine and can produce a fall in blood pressure, flushing, and bronchoconstriction.  It is also metabolized to laudanosine, which can provoke seizures. $#(Choice B)#  Baclofen is a muscle relaxant that affects GABAB receptors at the level of the spinal cord. $#(Choice C)#  Dantrolene is a muscle relaxant effective in malignant hyperthermia.  It acts on ryanodine receptors on the sarcoplasmic reticulum and prevents release of calcium into the cytoplasm of muscle fibers. $#Educational objective# Succinylcholine can cause significant potassium release and life-threatening arrhythmias in patients at high risk for hyperkalemia, including those with burns, myopathies, crush injuries, and denervating injuries or disease.

Gingival hyperplasia may regress after discontinuation of phenytoin. $Phenytoin is an anticonvulsant effective in the treatment of grand mal (tonic-clonic) seizures, partial seizures, and status epilepticus.  Phenytoin inhibits abnormal electrical activity of the brain by blocking voltage-gated sodium channels in neurons.  Phenytoin has a narrow therapeutic index with a number of potential adverse effects:  $1. Phenytoin toxicity is mainly characterized by CNS manifestations.  Its effect on the cerebellum and vestibular system can cause ataxia and nystagmus.  $2. Long-term therapy with phenytoin may cause gingival hyperplasia, coarsening of the facial features, and hirsutism.  $3. Phenytoin interferes with the metabolism of folic acid and may cause megaloblastic anemia.  $4. Phenytoin induces the P450 cytochrome oxidase system.  It increases the metabolism—and therefore decreases the blood level—of many medications.  $5.

Isoniazid is structurally similar to #pyridoxine# (vitamin B6), a #cofactor# for enzymes involved in# synthesis of certain neurotransmitters#.  Because of this similarity, isoniazid acts as a competitive inhibitor of pyridoxine and can cause dose-related peripheral neuropathy (eg, numbness and tingling in the hands and feet).  Sensory ataxia (due to loss of peripheral proprioception) and decreased pain sensation are also common features. $Patients at increased risk of #isoniazid-induced peripheral neuropathy# include those who are elderly, are malnourished (eg, alcohol use disorder), or have liver or kidney dysfunction; management involves supplementation with pyridoxine. $#(Choice A)#  Paresthesia is common in Guillain-Barré syndrome, an immune-mediated demyelinating disorder, but a progressive ascending paralysis would be seen.  Multiple sclerosis is also an immune-mediated demyelinating disease, and ataxia can occur, but symmetric, bilateral paresthesia would not be expected.  Neither condition is associated with Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection or isoniazid therapy. $#(Choice B)#  Advanced glycation end products (eg, hemoglobin A1c) in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) contribute to the development of peripheral nerve ischemia.  This typically occurs in those with chronic (ie, >20 years), poorly controlled DM.  In contrast, this otherwise healthy patient developed neuropathy within months of starting isoniazid without pyridoxine, making diabetic neuropathy far less likely. $#(Choice C)#  Certain chemotherapeutic drugs (eg, vincristine) may directly cause peripheral neuropathy by inhibiting microtubule formation.  In contrast, isoniazid is not directly toxic to neurons. $#(Choice D)#  Infection with Mycobacterium leprae (ie, leprosy) can cause peripheral neuropathy from impaired myelin production (due to bacterial replication within infected Schwann cells); however, skin findings (eg, erythematous macules, nodules) are also characteristic but are not seen in this patient.  In contrast, this patient has pulmonary tuberculosis caused by M tuberculosis, which does not affect myelin production. $#Educational objective# Isoniazid is structurally similar to pyridoxine (vitamin B6) and competes for binding sites on pyridoxine-dependent enzymes.  This leads to decreased synthesis of certain neurotransmitters, which may result in peripheral neuropathy.  Management involves pyridoxine supplementation.  "

They can be subclassified by their effects: $• #Nondepolarizing agents# (eg, #vecuronium#, rocuronium) are competitive antagonists of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.  Because of the low number of functioning receptors, patients with MG are #extremely sensitive# to these agents; very small doses can induce paralysis with loss of airway patency. $• Depolarizing agents (eg, succinylcholine) are competitive agonists of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors; persistent depolarization leads to desensitization of the motor end plate.  Because the low number of functioning receptors tends to inhibit end-plate depolarization, patients with MG are often #resistant# to these agents; extremely large doses are required to induce muscle relaxation. $#(Choice A)#  Atropine is a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist often used before general anesthesia to decrease salivary and bronchial secretions (helping maintain airway patency) and to prevent myocardial depression (minimizing risk for hypotension).  It has no effect on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the neuromuscular junctions. $#(Choices B and C)#  Isoflurane is a general anesthetic (acting centrally on multiple receptors) that can cause malignant hyperthermia in those with genetic predispositions.  Midazolam is a benzodiazepine (acting on the GABA A receptor) that produces sedation.  These medications are not contraindicated in MG. $#(Choice D)#  Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (eg, neostigmine, pyridostigmine) hinder the degradation of acetylcholine in the synapse, thereby increasing the amount available to stimulate nicotinic receptors.  They are often used to hasten recovery from nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockade and to improve muscle strength in patients with MG.  Because such patients have fewer functional receptors, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors typically exhibit decreased potency. $#Educational objective# Myasthenia gravis (MG) is caused by autoantibodies against postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, leading to fewer functional receptors and fatigable muscle weakness.

  "explanation_2": "Cell membrane receptors can be divided into two broad categories: ionotropic receptors  (ion channels that open directly upon ligand binding) and metabotropic receptors (these receptors utilize second messengers to indirectly influence their corresponding ion channels).  Nicotinic cholinergic receptors of the neuromuscular junction are an example of a ligand-gated ion channel receptor (ionotropic receptor).  As an action potential progresses to the presynaptic terminal, voltage-gated calcium channels open and allow entry of calcium into the nerve cytoplasm.  This triggers the fusion of storage vesicles with the membrane, allowing a release of acetylcholine (ACh).  This ACh diffuses across the synaptic cleft and ultimately interacts with nicotinic cholinergic receptors present on the motor end-plate.  These receptors are ion channels that are comprised of five subunits with two ACh binding sites.  If, and only if, both binding sites are filled, the ion channel will open.  There is subsequent sodium and calcium #influx# and potassium #outflux# that results in the generation of an end-plate potential. $Nicotinic cholinergic receptors are also found in the CNS and on postganglionic neurons of autonomic ganglia.  The description in the question stem most likely represents a nicotinic cholinergic receptor given the #immediate# flux of sodium, calcium, and potassium demonstrated by the scientists. $#(Choice A)#  Binding of epinephrine to α1 adrenoceptors results in the activation of the inositol triphosphate (IP3) pathway.  This pathway results in increased intracellular calcium via release of Ca2+ from storage organelles. $#(Choices B & C)#  β1 and β2 adrenoceptors are associated with the cAMP signal transduction pathway.  Stimulation of  these receptors causes protein kinase A activation. $#(Choice D)#  M1 and M3 muscarinic receptors utilize the inositol triphosphate pathway to increase intracellular calcium concentration and activate protein kinase C.  M2 muscarinic receptors act via the cAMP second messenger system, and when activated decrease intracellular cAMP concentrations. $#Educational objective# The autonomic nervous system utilizes three types of signal pathways: cAMP, IP3, and ion channels.  Nicotinic receptors are ligand-gated ion channels that open after binding acetylcholine.  This results in an immediate influx of Na+ and Ca2+ into the cell and an outflux of K+ from the cell.  "

Unlike levodopa, they do not have to be metabolized to be active.  In addition to having similar adverse effects as levodopa (eg, nausea, orthostasis), dopamine agonists' direct stimulation of dopamine receptors can cause impulse control disorders (eg, pathologic gambling, compulsive sexuality), likely because dopamine is involved in the rewards pathway. $#(Choice A)#  Selegiline inhibits monoamine oxidase-B in the brain, which results in decreased central dopamine degradation, leaving more available to stimulate the basal ganglia. $#(Choice C)#  Amantadine enhances the effect of endogenous dopamine by increasing dopamine release and inhibiting its reuptake.  It is also thought to cause anticholinergic effects (reduces tremor), as well as antagonism of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (reduces glutamine-induced neurotoxicity). $#(Choice D)#  Both catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors (eg, entacapone, tolcapone) and dopa decarboxylase inhibitors (eg, carbidopa) decrease the breakdown of levodopa in peripheral tissues and increase the amount of levodopa available to cross the blood-brain barrier. $#(Choice E)#  The dopamine insufficiency of PD upsets the normal balance between dopamine and acetylcholine in the basal ganglia, resulting in cholinergic hypersensitivity.  Anticholinergic medications (eg, trihexyphenidyl) counteract this effect by inhibiting central muscarinic receptors.  These drugs are typically limited to younger patients with tremor-dominant PD due to adverse effects in the elderly and lack of effect on bradykinesia/rigidity. $#Educational objective# Dopamine agonists have a chemical structure similar to that of the neurotransmitter dopamine and directly stimulate dopamine receptors.

At this point, no more of the anesthetic can dissolve in the blood and the blood is said to be saturated with the anesthetic.  The speed at which the blood becomes saturated depends on the solubility of the gas in the blood.  Highly soluble anesthetics dissolve easily in the blood, and thus larger amounts must be absorbed before the blood becomes saturated. $Blood solubility of an anesthetic is indicated by its #blood/gas partition coefficient# - anesthetics with higher blood solubility have larger blood/gas partition coefficients.  Nitrous oxide (N2O) is an example of a poorly soluble gas with a blood/gas partition coefficient of 0.47.  In the graph above, the partial pressure of N2O in blood rises rapidly and plateaus, indicating that the blood quickly becomes saturated with the anesthetic.  In contrast, drug A has higher solubility (ie, a larger blood/gas partition coefficient) as its partial pressure in the blood rises more slowly.  The curve for drug A eventually levels out at the same partial pressure as N2O since the drugs are inspired at equal partial pressures.  However, by this point, far more drug A is dissolved in the blood. $The speed of anesthetic induction is determined by the rate at which the brain tissues take up the agent, which is dependent on the solubility of the anesthetic in the blood.  If an agent has poor blood solubility, the amount of gas needed to saturate the blood is small and brain saturation occurs fairly quickly.  Conversely, highly soluble anesthetics are absorbed to a greater degree by the blood, delaying saturation of the central nervous system.  ",
  "explanation_2": "#(Choices A, D, and E)#  Nitrous oxide is an example of a gas with relatively low solubility in the blood.  It is characterized by rapid onset of action and fast equilibration with the brain. $#(Choice C)#  Potency of a gas anesthetic is determined by the minimal alveolar concentration.  It is defined as the concentration of gas in the lungs that produces the desired effect in 50% of patients.  Potent anesthetics require lower partial pressures to be effective. $#Educational objective# The onset of action of a gas anesthetic depends on its solubility in the blood (blood/gas partition coefficient).  Drugs with high blood/gas partition coefficients are more soluble in the blood, demonstrate slower equilibration with the brain, and have longer onset times.  "

  "explanation_2": "$#Migraines# are recurrent, debilitating, unilateral headaches with a pulsating or throbbing quality lasting between 4-72 hours, often with photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea.  They can be associated with an aura and are more common in younger women. $Although the pathogenesis of migraines is multifactorial and not fully understood, it is associated with cortical spreading depression (ie, self-propagating neurotransmission across the cortex).  Subsequent stimulation of #trigeminal afferents# in the meninges causes the release of #vasoactive neuropeptides#, including substance P and #calcitonin gene–related peptide# (CGRP), leading to neurogenic inflammation, vasodilation, and plasma protein extravasation.  These substances may also contribute to the increased sensitivity of nociceptive pathways to stimuli (ie, neuronal sensitization). $#Triptans# (eg, sumatriptan) are serotonin #5#-#hydroxytryptamine 1B/1D# #agonists# that directly counter migraine headaches by binding to trigeminal serotonin receptors and #inhibiting CGRP# release from the trigeminal neurons.  In addition, triptans bind serotonin receptors on the smooth muscle cells of blood vessels, resulting in intracranial vasoconstriction.  Triptans are commonly prescribed as #abortive therapy# for acute migraines, particularly in patients who are not responsive to analgesics.  Significant adverse effects include dizziness, chest tightness, and #hypertension#. $#(Choice A)#  Antipsychotic medications (eg, haloperidol, risperidone) block the dopamine receptors in the mesolimbic tract and are used in schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.  They are not indicated in the treatment of migraine. $#(Choice B)#  Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (eg, sertraline, citalopram) block serotonin reuptake in cortico-amygdala pathways.  These drugs are used to treat depression and anxiety, not to abort migraines. $#(Choice C)#  Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (eg, rivastigmine, galantamine) increase the availability of acetylcholine at cortical synapses and are indicated in the treatment of dementia (eg, Alzheimer disease). $#(Choice D)#  Opioid medications (eg, morphine, oxycodone) stimulate mu receptors in the periaqueductal gray area, resulting in modulation of pain.  Opioids are not indicated in the treatment of migraines because they increase the risk of chronic migraine, carry a risk of dependence, and are less effective than triptans. $#Educational objective# The pathogenesis of migraines is complex and multifactorial but includes neurogenic inflammation, vasodilation, and sensitization of trigeminal afferents in the meninges.  Triptans are serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine 1B/1D agonists that stimulate the trigeminovascular serotonin receptors, resulting in inhibition of vasoactive peptide release, intracranial vasoconstriction, and decreased pain.  They are used as abortive therapy for acute migraine.  "

Therefore, she is most likely suffering from #Alzheimer disease# (AD), the most common form of primary dementia. $The pathogenesis of AD is complex but culminates in diffuse atrophy of cortical neurons.  Specifically, #degeneration of cholinergic neurons# in the basal forebrain contributes to memory loss and functional decline.  These cholinergic neurons project throughout the neocortex to positively regulate areas involved in memory (hippocampal formations) and executive function (frontal cortex), which are impaired in AD.  Cholinesterase inhibitors (eg, donepezil, galantamine) block acetylcholinesterase in the synaptic cleft to compensate for the loss of cholinergic transmission. $#Cholinesterase inhibitors# have modest effects on memory and cognition to #improve daily functioning#.  Cholinergic therapy should be considered in most patients with AD.

However, acyclovir is not a common cause of AIN; common causes include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, penicillins, cephalosporins, diuretics, and allopurinol. $#(Choice C)#  Acyclovir blood level monitoring is not typically performed in the clinical setting.  It is also not always effective in preventing nephrotoxicity; in states of low intravascular volume (eg, dehydration), nephrotoxicity can develop secondary to increased tubular concentration even when blood levels are not within the toxic range. $#(Choice D)#  Allopurinol blocks xanthine oxidase, which reduces the formation of uric acid.  Pretreatment with allopurinol is often used in patients with lymphoma and leukemia to prevent urate crystal nephropathy due to tumor lysis syndrome.  Acyclovir nephrotoxicity is mediated by the formation of acyclovir crystals, not urate crystals, so allopurinol pretreatment would be ineffective. $#(Choice E)#  Pretreatment with prednisone can help prevent radiocontrast-induced allergic reactions.

The virus preferentially targets T lymphocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages because these cells contain high surface concentrations of CD4.  However, each of these cell types contains different surface concentrations of the 2 chemokine receptors.  HIV is considered #tropic# for a certain cell type, depending on whether it preferentially binds to CCR5 or CXCR4 for viral entry, as follows: $• #R5 virus# uses CCR5 for viral entry and is considered #macrophage-tropic# because CCR5 is expressed in high concentrations on both macrophages and lymphocytes.  R5 is the predominant HIV type. $• #X4 virus# uses CXCR4 for viral entry and is considered #T lymphotropic# because CXCR4 is expressed primarily on T lymphocytes but only #minimally on macrophages#. $HIV trophism is determined by a gene sequence in the variable (V3) region of the #env gene#, which encodes for the HIV surface glycoprotein 120.

These antiviral proteins promote the degradation of RNA and halt protein translation in virally infected cells only. $#(Choice C)#  Impairment of viral RNA replication is accomplished by the reverse transcriptase inhibitors used to combat HIV (eg, abacavir, tenofovir, zidovudine). $#(Choice D)#  Amantadine (limited use in influenza management due to viral resistance) impairs uncoating or disassembly of the influenza A virion after host cell endocytosis.  Oseltamivir does not operate via the same mechanism of action.  Currently, amantadine is mainly used in Parkinson disease as it increases dopamine release (unclear mechanism). $#Educational objective# Oseltamivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor useful in the treatment and prevention of both influenza A and B virus infections.  This medication impairs the release of newly formed virions from infected host cells and impairs viral penetration of mucous secretions that overlie the respiratory epithelium.  "

Infections in sub-Saharan Africa are primarily due to Plasmodium falciparum, whereas infections in #South and Central America# are largely caused by #Plasmodium vivax#.  Both species are endemic to India, East Asia, and the western Pacific nations. $The life cycle of malaria is relatively preserved across the 4 Plasmodium species.  A bite by a female #Anopheles# mosquito transmits sporozoites into the host bloodstream; sporozoites then spread to the #liver#, infect hepatocytes, and replicate.  Lysis of infected hepatocytes releases #merozoites# into the bloodstream, which rapidly invade circulating erythrocytes.  P falciparum infects erythrocytes of all ages, leading to a very high degree of parasitemia; in contrast, P vivax and Plasmodium ovale prefer young, larger erythrocytes. $Following erythrocyte invasion, the merozoites feed on hemoglobin and mature from ring forms → trophozoites → schizonts.  Schizont maturation occurs synchronously within erythrocytes, resulting in simultaneous cell lysis and release of proinflammatory substances, which causes #paroxysms of fever#. $Unlike other species, P vivax and P ovale form #hypnozoites# in the liver that are #dormant and reactivate# weeks or months later.

  "explanation_2": "Alcohols, including ethanol and isopropanol, are widely used as disinfecting agents in the health care setting.  They are commonly used to clean the skin before immunization or venipuncture and to disinfect external surfaces of equipment.  They function by disorganizing the lipid structure in membranes, causing them to be leaky, and by denaturing cellular proteins.  Alcohols require the presence of water for maximal activity and are most effective at 60%-90% concentration.  They are rapidly bactericidal and also tuberculocidal, fungicidal, and virucidal, but do not destroy bacterial spores. $#(Choice A)#  Chlorhexidine works by destabilizing cell membranes and coagulating intracellular constituents.  In combination with 70% alcohol, it is the antiseptic of choice for many surgical and percutaneous procedures.  Its use is contraindicated in neurologic, otologic, and ophthalmologic procedures due to neurotoxicity. $#(Choice B)#  Formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde function by alkylating and cross-linking DNA and proteins.  They are most commonly used for sterilization of hospital instruments that cannot withstand autoclave temperatures. $#(Choice D)#  Iodine causes halogenation of proteins and DNA.  Solutions containing iodine are frequently used for antisepsis in surgical and percutaneous procedures.  However, they are less effective than chlorhexidine-alcohol and cause more skin irritation and toxicity. $#(Choice E)#  Hydrogen peroxide functions as an oxidant by producing hydroxyl free radicals that attack cellular components.  It is excellent at disinfecting inanimate objects but is less effective when used on organic materials.  Hydrogen peroxide is often used for skin cleansing and wound debridement due to its effervescent quality. $#Educational objective# Alcohols function by disorganizing the lipid structure in membranes, causing them to be leaky, and by denaturing cellular proteins.  They are bactericidal, tuberculocidal, fungicidal, and virucidal, but do not destroy bacterial spores.  "

  "explanation_2": "#Isoniazid# is an antimicrobial agent that is active only against mycobacteria.  Its specificity is derived from its #inhibition of mycolic acid synthesis#.  Mycolic acids form long branched-chain fatty acids in the outer portion of the mycobacterial peptidoglycan cell wall; they are essential for proper #cell wall# structure and virulence factor synthesis (eg, sulfatides, wax D, cord factor).  When mycobacteria are unable to synthesize mycolic acids, they lose the fidelity of the cell wall and are unable to divide to form new cells. $Mycolic acids in the cell wall are what cause mycobacteria to be #acid-fast#.  This property is due to the retention of a stain (eg, carbolfuchsin dye) despite exposure to an acid-alcohol decolorizing agent.  If the quantity of mycolic acids in the cell wall is reduced (eg, following exposure to isoniazid), the organism will lose the color of the stain when exposed to an acid-alcohol agent. $#(Choice A)#  Fluoroquinolones (eg, ciprofloxacin) can be used as part of a multi-drug regimen to treat some forms of drug resistant tuberculosis.  They inhibit DNA gyrase, leading to fractures in the bacterial chromosome and an inability to code for proteins necessary for survival.  Fluoroquinolones would not have a direct effect on the acid-fastness of mycobacteria. $#(Choice C)#  Rifampin is an essential component of the multi-drug regimen used to treat active tuberculosis.  Rifampin halts bacterial protein synthesis by inhibiting bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, thereby preventing DNA transcription into mRNA.  Rifampin would inhibit mycobacterial growth in an in vitro culture, but it would not cause the mycobacteria to lose their acid-fastness. $#(Choice D)#  Streptomycin is an aminoglycoside that inhibits the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit, thereby halting protein synthesis.  This restricts mycobacterial cell growth and leads to cell death.  However, the acid-fastness of the organism is not affected.  Streptomycin is also indicated in the treatment of plague (caused by Yersinia pestis) and tularemia (caused by Francisella tularensis). $#(Choice E)#  Vancomycin binds to D-alanyl-D-alanine residues, inhibiting polymerization and cross-linking of the glycopeptides forming the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria (not mycobacteria). $#Educational objective# Isoniazid is an antimycobacterial agent that specifically inhibits the synthesis of mycolic acids, which are essential components of the mycobacterial peptidoglycan cell wall.  Without mycolic acids, the mycobacteria lose their acid-fastness and become unable to synthesize new cell walls or multiply.  "

Altered aminoglycosides have a reduced ability to bind to the 16S ribosomal RNA within the 30S ribosomal subunit, leading to increased minimum inhibitory concentrations and reduced bactericidal effects.  Most antibiotic-modifying enzymes arise via transfer of plasmids or transposons rather than chromosomal mutations. $#(Choices A, D, and E)#  Cephalosporins (eg, ceftazidime), carbapenems (eg, imipenem), and penicillins (eg, piperacillin) are beta-lactam drugs that exert their effect by interfering with the cell wall.  Resistance to cephalosporins and penicillins occurs largely because of the bacterial secretion of beta-lactamase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes the beta-lactam ring and inactivates the antibiotic.  Carbapenems are not very susceptible to most beta-lactamases due to additional chemical components surrounding their beta-lactam ring; however, resistance to carbapenems can occur due to carbapenemase, which is primarily seen in Enterobacter species. $#(Choice B)#  Fluoroquinolones (eg, ciprofloxacin) block enzymes (DNA gyrase, topoisomerase) responsible for bacterial DNA synthesis.  Resistance usually occurs due to genetic mutations that prevent drug binding to these enzymes or to the increased expression of antibiotic efflux pumps. $#Educational objective# Aminoglycoside (eg, gentamicin) resistance is most commonly due to antibiotic-modifying enzymes.

  "explanation_2": "This patient's acute dysuria, urinary frequency/urgency, suprapubic tenderness, and pyuria/bacteriuria indicate #acute simple cystitis#.  Women are at greater risk than men due to the short distance between the anus and vaginal introitus, which allows enteric bacteria to contaminate the urethra and ascend into the bladder.  #Recent sexual intercourse# is the single greatest risk factor in otherwise healthy women. $Most cases of acute simple cystitis are caused by the enteric bacteria #Escherichia coli#.  However, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus are also frequently isolated.  Patients with no risk factors for resistant bacteria (eg, recent inpatient hospitalization or antibiotic use) are generally treated empirically with 3-6 days of nitrofurantoin or #trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole# (TMP-SMX) due to their excellent efficacy and low risk of side effects. $#(Choices A and B)#  Azithromycin and doxycycline treat Chlamydia trachomatous infections of the urogenital tract.  Most cases of chlamydia are asymptomatic, but some patients have dysuria and urinary frequency.  Although urinalysis will reveal pyuria, no bacteria would be seen on urinary Gram stain because C trachomatous has no cell wall.  Neither azithromycin nor doxycycline adequately treats enteric, gram-negative pathogens; therefore, neither is typically used for acute simple cystitis. $#(Choice C)#  Fluconazole is often used to treat vaginal candidiasis, which can cause dysuria and is often linked to vaginal intercourse.  However, most patients also have vaginal itching and soreness.  The presence of urinary frequency, urgency, and pyuria/bacteriuria makes bacterial cystitis more likely. $#(Choice D)#  Metronidazole can treat Trichomonas vaginalis, a flagellated protozoan that is transmitted during sexual intercourse.  Women infected with trichomonas often have dysuria and frequency, but most also have a purulent, malodourous vaginal discharge.  The presence of pyuria/bacteriuria on urinalysis makes acute bacterial cystitis more likely. $#Educational objective# Acute simple cystitis often occurs in young, otherwise healthy women, particularly following sexual intercourse.  Common manifestations include dysuria, urinary frequency/urgency, and urinalysis evidence of pyuria/bacteriuria.  Empiric treatment with nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is typically curative.  "

  "explanation_2": "#Entamoeba histolytica# is a protozoan endemic to resource-limited regions (eg, East Africa) where sanitation is poor.  Transmission primarily occurs via the fecal-oral route due to the ingestion of infectious cysts in contaminated food and water. $Ingested cysts travel to the distal small intestine, where they release trophozoites that migrate to the colon.  The trophozoites multiply in the colon and mature to cysts that are released in stool and subsequently transmitted to other persons.  The vast majority of infected individuals are #asymptomatic#.

These are common and are seen most frequently during initial infusions (often diminish with subsequent infusions).  Premedication with antipyretics and antihistamines can lessen the severity of these effects. $• #Dose-dependent nephrotoxicity# can result from a drug-induced decrease in the glomerular filtration rate.

  "explanation_2": "$The 2 major factors influencing the effectiveness of antimicrobial agents are the drug concentration at the target site and the amount of time that microbes are exposed to the drug.  The relative contribution of these factors to drug efficacy depends on the particular agent.  In general, antibiotics can be classified into 2 categories based on which factor is more important: $• #Concentration-dependent killing:# Antibiotics with this pattern of activity (eg, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones) have a persistent, suppressive effect on bacterial growth following a limited exposure, resulting in increased killing ability when drug levels at the site of infection are maximized.  The #higher the peak drug level# compared to the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), the #greater the antimicrobial activity#.  As such, higher-dose, #extended-interval# (ie, once-daily) regimens are frequently used to optimize bacterial killing. $• #Time-dependent killing:# Antibiotics with this activity pattern (eg, beta-lactams [penicillins, cephalosporins], clindamycin) have minimal persistent effects and are dependent on #long exposure durations# for their antimicrobial activity.  They are more effective when serum concentrations #exceed the MIC# for a prolonged period.  Therefore, more frequent, #multiple-daily dosing# regimens are used to maintain plasma concentrations greater than the MIC for as long as possible. $#(Choice B)#  The therapeutic index (ie, [toxic dose]/[effective dose]) is a measurement of the relative safety of a drug; it is an intrinsic property upon which drug dosing regimens are devised.  A relatively high therapeutic index is usually necessary to prevent toxicity with extended-interval dosing because the administered drug amounts lead to higher serum levels than seen with more frequent dosing regimens. $#(Choice C)#  Most drugs exhibit a sigmoid-shaped @dose response curve@ that shows no effect until a threshold concentration is exceeded.  After this occurs, the effects increase with increasing drug concentration until a saturation threshold (ie, maximum effect) is reached.  In contrast to this sigmoidal response, the risk of cancer following exposure to ionizing radiation shows a linear dose–response relationship (ie, risk increases proportionately with increased exposure). $#(Choice D)#  The threshold dose is the lowest dose at which drug effects are first seen.  In this case, both dosing regimens cause serum concentrations to rise above the MIC.  Furthermore, the extended-interval dosing regimen results in less total time above the MIC but still demonstrates effectiveness.  Therefore, a low dosing threshold does not explain the effectiveness of extended-interval dosing. $#(Choice E)#  In this example, both treatment regimens were effective, with extended-interval dosing having a slightly better response time.  Because serum concentrations with the extended-interval regimen remain above the MIC for a much shorter period of time compared to multiple-daily dosing, time-dependent killing does not contribute significantly to overall drug efficacy. $#Educational objective# Antibiotics exhibiting concentration-dependent killing can be administered using relatively high doses given at lower frequency.  This allows for effective microbial killing while preventing adverse effects that may occur with prolonged systemic exposure.  ",

  "explanation_2": "HIV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is converted into cDNA (copy/complementary DNA) by the HIV enzyme #reverse transcriptase#.  This enzyme grows DNA by adding nucleotides to the terminal 3′-hydroxyl group using a 3′-5′ #phosphodiester bond#.  #Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors# (NRTIs) such as zidovudine block this step in viral replication.  This class of medications is composed of nucleoside/nucleotide analogues that #do not have a 3′-hydroxyl group#.  When reverse transcriptase incorporates an NRTI into a growing DNA strand, it results in chain termination because no 3′-hydroxyl group is available to add additional base pairs. $Zidovudine (ZDV) was the first approved HIV medication but is now used primarily to prevent maternal to fetal transmission of HIV during labor and delivery.  It is a thymidine analogue that contains an azido group in place of the hydroxyl group usually found at the 3′ end of thymidine. $#(Choice A)#  The enzyme thymidylate synthase catalyzes the conversion of deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) to deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP).  N5, N10-methylene tetrahydrofolate is the methyl donor in this reaction and is converted to dihydrofolate (DHF) in the process.  Tetrahydrofolate is then regenerated from DHF by dihydrofolate reductase.  Methotrexate is a chemotherapeutic agent that inhibits DNA synthesis by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase. $#(Choice B)#  Integration of viral DNA into the host genome is mediated by integrase, an HIV enzyme that is inhibited by integrase strand transfer inhibitors (eg, raltegravir). $#(Choice C)#  Inhibition of nucleoside phosphorylation is not an effect of ZDV.  In fact, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (including ZDV) must be phosphorylated within the host cell to form the functional triphosphate moiety.  Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors can bind directly to (and inactivate) reverse transcriptase without being phosphorylated. $#(Choice E)#  In double-stranded DNA, A always pairs with T, and G always pairs with C.  These bases bind via hydrogen bonds.  Some chemotherapeutic agents, such as the anthracyclines daunorubicin and doxorubicin, intercalate between the bases, causing defective base pairing and splitting of the DNA strands.  Transcription and replication failure and mutagenesis ultimately result. $#Educational objective# Zidovudine (ZDV) is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor used to prevent maternal to fetal transmission of HIV during labor (when the mother is not virally suppressed).  It is a thymidine analogue that does not have the normal 3′-hydroxyl group found on thymidine.  Because new nucleotides are added to growing DNA chains only at the 3′-hydroxyl group, the addition of ZDV into DNA results in chain termination.  "

Rifamycins exert their effect by #blocking# DNA-dependent #RNA polymerase#, which prevents bacterial transcription and subsequent protein synthesis; resistance typically arises due to mutations that result in structural alterations of the enzyme. $#(Choice A)#  Structural alteration of enzymes involved in DNA winding-unwinding would impair the activity of fluoroquinolones, which bind and inhibit DNA gyrase in bacterial cells, causing fracture of the DNA chain.  Fluroquinolones do not cause reddish discoloration of body fluids. $#(Choice C)#  Antibiotics that act on the ribosome can be divided into those that act on the 50S subunit (eg, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, linezolid, macrolides) and those that act on the smaller 30S subunit (tetracycline, doxycycline, aminoglycosides).  These are not typically used in initial 4 drug therapy for TB. $#(Choice D)#  Decreased bacterial catalase-peroxidase activity is a mycobacterial resistance mechanism for isoniazid.  Before it can inhibit mycolic acid synthesis, isoniazid must be converted to its active form by the mycobacterial catalase-peroxidase enzyme.  However, isoniazid does not cause reddish discoloration of body fluids. $#(Choice E)#  Upregulation of beta-lactamase synthesis would impair the activity of beta-lactam drugs (eg, penicillins, aminopenicillins, cephalosporins, monobactams).  Infections caused by organisms expressing beta-lactamase require the addition of a beta-lactamase inhibitor (eg, clavulanic acid, sulbactam, tazobactam) or the use of an alternate drug class (eg, carbapenem). $#Educational objective# Rifamycins (eg, rifampin) block the action of the bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, thereby inhibiting bacterial transcription; resistance is acquired by mutations that modify the enzyme's structure.

  "explanation_2": "A forceful cough in an #unimmunized# infant and a #household contact# with prolonged coughing symptoms should raise concern for #pertussis#.  Pertussis is caused by the gram-negative bacterium Bordetella pertussis and spreads via respiratory droplets.  The greatest risk factor is lack of immunization, and older children/adults with mild disease are often the source of infection. $Pertussis is a #prolonged illness# that typically progresses through 3 stages:  catarrhal (mild rhinorrhea or cough), paroxysmal (bouts of severe cough), and convalescent (weeks to months of gradual resolution).  Infants are at high risk of complications (eg, cyanosis, apnea, seizure), particularly during the paroxysmal stage.  Diagnostic clues include #lack of fever#, as well as cough associated with #turning red in the face#, an inspiratory whoop, or posttussive emesis.  #Lymphocytosis#, the degree of which correlates with disease severity, is also a characteristic finding and related to impaired leukocyte chemotaxis caused by pertussis toxin. $Pertussis is usually a clinical diagnosis and should be treated empirically with a #macrolide# antibiotic (eg, azithromycin).  Macrolides bind the #bacterial 50S ribosomal subunit#, which prevents the addition of amino acids to the growing peptide chain.  This results in the @inhibition of protein synthesis@ by bacteria. $#(Choice A)#  Beta-lactam antibiotics (eg, penicillins, cephalosporins) and vancomycin @inhibit cell wall synthesis@.  These medications are often indicated for lobar pneumonia in children, which is unlikely in a child with clear lungs on auscultation and no fever.  In addition, beta-lactam antibiotics do not clear B pertussis from the nasopharynx, and vancomycin is generally effective against gram-positive, not gram-negative, bacteria. $#(Choice B)#  Fluoroquinolones (eg, ciprofloxacin) interfere with bacterial DNA synthesis but are not effective against B pertussis.  Moreover, their use is avoided in children when possible due to potential adverse effects (eg, tendon rupture). $#(Choice C)#  Certain antiparasitic medications (eg, mebendazole, albendazole) inhibit microtubule assembly, disrupting the cytoskeleton of the parasite.  B pertussis is a bacterium. $#(Choice E)#  Neuraminidase inhibitors (eg, oseltamivir) @block virion release@ from cells infected by influenza virus.  In contrast to this case, influenza typically presents with cough and fever that improve within a week. $#Educational objective# Pertussis is a clinical diagnosis (eg, prolonged, forceful cough; household contact with prolonged cough; lack of immunization; lymphocytosis) and should be treated empirically.  The treatment of choice is a macrolide antibiotic (eg, azithromycin), which binds to the bacterial ribosomal subunit and inhibits protein synthesis.  ",

  "explanation_2": "$This patient with enterococcal endocarditis likely received an #aminoglycoside# (AG) such as gentamicin, a ribosome-targeting antibiotic.  AGs are associated with #ototoxicity# (hearing loss, tinnitus) and #nephrotoxicity#. $mRNA is translated into amino acids (AAs) and proteins on ribosomes. $• The small ribosomal subunit (30S in prokaryotes, 40S in eukaryotes) binds mRNA, which contains genetic information serving as a reading frame, and tRNA, which serves as an AA carrier $• The larger ribosomal subunit (50S in prokaryotes, 60S in eukaryotes) contains peptidyltransferase, which catalyzes peptide bond formation between AAs $In #prokaryotes#, a unique mRNA sequence (Shine-Dalgarno) is located upstream from initiation codon AUG, which recognizes an N-formylmethionine-tRNA.  This sequence allows 30S binding to mRNA and this N-formylmethionine-tRNA (forming the prokaryotic 30S #initiation complex#).  The energy for this reaction (GTP hydrolysis) brings the 50S subunit into the initiation complex, resulting in a 70S ribosomal unit. $AGs irreversibly bind to #bacterial 30S# but not eukaryotic 40S; this causes #genetic code misreading# and bacterial protein synthesis inhibition.  AGs also appear to impact #translocation#, whereby an aminoacyl-tRNA is shifted from the ribosomal A site (after initial binding) to the P site (after AA incorporation into the peptide chain during elongation) to the E site (after AA cleaving from its tRNA).  The initial N-formylmethionine-tRNA notably binds at the P site. $#(Choice A)#  AGs need to diffuse inside the cell to reach the ribosome.  As a result, they are often prescribed #synergistically# in combination with antibiotics affecting cell wall synthesis.  These include penicillins, which impact cell wall cross-linking, or vancomycin.  Vancomycin is also associated with ototoxicity, but it is a glycopeptide antibiotic that acts by #directly# inhibiting peptidoglycan synthesis, #not# cell wall cross-linking (which occurs at a later stage of cell wall synthesis).  Although Enterococcus is generally resistant to AGs, these drugs are routinely used as synergistic agents# in combination# with penicillins or vancomycin in patients with enterococcal endocarditis; such combinations lead to improved bacterial killing and are the standard of care for this condition. $#(Choices B and C)#  Fluoroquinolones act on DNA gyrase to prevent DNA unwinding.  Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole affects folic acid synthesis.  These antibiotics are not classically associated with ototoxicity and are not used synergistically for enterococcal endocarditis. $#(Choice D)#  Daptomycin disrupts the bacterial membrane by creating transmembrane channels that cause intracellular ion leakage and cellular membrane depolarization.  Its main side effects are myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. $#(Choice F)#  tRNA charging refers to initial covalent bonding between tRNA and the corresponding AA, facilitated by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase; inhibitors of this enzyme are potential antibiotics. $#Educational objective# Aminoglycosides inhibit genetic code reading and protein synthesis by binding to the prokaryotic 30S ribosomal subunit."

  "explanation_2": "$#Heparin# is an endogenous anticoagulant that exerts its effect #indirectly# by binding to #antithrombin# #III# (AT), a serine protease inhibitor that irreversibly neutralizes clotting factors.  Heparin binding alters the shape of AT, which converts it from a #slow to rapid inactivator# of clotting factors and increases its activity #>1,000 fold#. $Although AT neutralizes a number of clotting factors in the intrinsic pathway, its anticoagulant effect primarily stems from the inactivation of #factor Xa# and #thrombin#.  Therefore, patients who receive heparin products typically have the following coagulation changes: $• #Prolonged thrombin time:# Thrombin inactivation is strongest with unfractionated heparin infusion because the length of heparin chains in this formulation are longer, which inactivates thrombin more rapidly.  Although low-molecular-weight heparin formulations contain shorter chain heparin molecules, they also inactivate thrombin but to a lesser extent. $• #Decreased activity of factor Xa:# All forms of heparin (eg, unfractionated, low molecular weight, fondaparinux) have strong activity against factor Xa.  Antifactor Xa activity is usually monitored to determine when adequate anticoagulation is achieved. $• #Prolonged partial thromboplastin time# (PTT): Heparin primarily inhibits the intrinsic and final common clotting pathway; therefore, PTT is prolonged. $Unlike heparin medications, which exert their anticoagulation effects broadly through the activation of AT, direct oral anticoagulants inhibit a single enzyme in the coagulation cascade, such as thrombin (eg, dabigatran) or factor Xa (eg, rivaroxaban). $#Educational objective# Heparin is an indirect anticoagulant that alters the shape of antithrombin (AT) III, thereby converting it from a slow to rapid inactivator of clotting factors.  Because AT primarily neutralizes factor Xa and thrombin, patients on heparin have decreased factor Xa activity and prolonged thrombin time/partial thromboplastin time.  In contrast, direct oral anticoagulants specifically target a single enzyme in the coagulation cascade, such as thrombin (eg, dabigatran) or factor Xa (eg, rivaroxaban).  "

Once activated, AT III binds to #factor Xa# and stops factor Xa from converting prothrombin to thrombin.  Less thrombin is produced, resulting in an anticoagulant effect. $Unfractionated heparin has more molecules than LMWH, allowing it to bind factor Xa and thrombin; it is more effective than LMWH in inactivating thrombin. $#(Choices B and C)#  Tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) converts plasminogen to plasmin.  Plasmin functions to break down fibrin, resulting in thrombolysis.  Because t-PA can only bind plasminogen strongly in the presence of fibrin, its thrombolytic action is clot specific. $#(Choice D)#  Protein C and protein S are endogenous antithrombotic molecules that are also vitamin K-dependent.  Due to their shorter half-lives in the circulation, these molecules are depleted first during initiation of warfarin therapy, causing a transient procoagulant state.  For this reason, patients are typically treated with heparin or LMWH during initiation of warfarin therapy. $#(Choice E)#  Prothrombin (factor II) is a vitamin K-dependent clotting factor.  This factor, along with factors VII, IX, and X, is depleted by warfarin.  LMWHs inhibit prothrombin production (through factor X inhibition), but they do not directly bind prothrombin. $#Educational objective# Enoxaparin is a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) that functions like heparin i n that it binds and activates antithrombin III (AT III).

  "explanation_2": "$The @cellular growth cycle@ consists of 4 distinct phases:  G1, S, G2, and M.  Progression through the phases is controlled by surveillance systems (checkpoints) that interrupt the cell cycle and/or induce apoptosis if cells do not meet the requirements to progress forward: $• The transition from G1→S (initiation of DNA replication) is controlled by a combination of cell size and nutrient status, exposure to growth factors, and proper surveillance and repair of damaged DNA. $• At the G2→M transition, the cell again checks for DNA damage and repairs replication errors before they can be passed on to daughter cells during mitosis.  An additional spindle checkpoint ensures that duplicated chromosomes separate appropriately during cell division. $#Cyclin-dependent kinases# (CDKs) 4 and 6 control cell cycle progression from G1→S.  These CDKs are activated by cyclin D and subsequently inhibit the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein, leading to the upregulation of transcriptional factors that #progress the cell cycle# to S phase.  Many cancers exploit this crucial checkpoint and achieve unregulated cellular growth via cyclin D amplification (or inactivating mutations to retinoblastoma gene). $#CDK 4/6 inhibitors# (eg, palbociclib) can be used to block the cyclin D binding site on CDK, which results in decreased CDK 4/6 activation, increased activity of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein, and cell cycle arrest.  Although CDK 4/6 inhibitors are generally well tolerated, they often #inhibit #cellular replication in other #rapidly dividing cells#, particularly hematologic cells in the #bone marrow#.

Cardiomyopathy is a common side effect of anthracyclines (eg, doxorubicin) and HER2 antibodies (eg, trastuzumab).  Sensorineural hearing loss can be seen with platinum-based chemotherapy (eg, cisplatin).  Peripheral neuropathy is a common side effect of vincristine and bortezomib. $#Educational objective# Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 4/6 regulate the movement of cells from G1→S phase.  Cancers often have mutations that enhance the activity or downstream effects of CDK 4/6, which contribute to unregulated cellular growth.

Folic acid is a required precursor to nucleic acid synthesis.  Barriers to its metabolism are especially effective in hindering the growth of rapidly proliferating cells such as in a developing embryo or certain types of cancer. $Normally, folic acid is reduced to dihydrofolate (DHF) by dihydrofolate reductase and then reduced further to #tetrahydrofolate# (THF), an integral precursor of #DNA synthesis#.  MTX is structurally similar to folic acid and competitively and irreversibly #inhibits DHF reductase#.  DHF reductase inhibition prevents the formation of THF #(choice D).# $After entering the target cell, MTX undergoes #polyglutamation#, which prevents the movement of MTX out of the cell, resulting in intracellular accumulation of MTX for later use.  Similarly, folate and recycled DHF are stored within the cell via polyglutamation.  Because MTX inhibits DHF reductase, folic acid and DHF polyglutamate will accumulate in cells. $#(Choice B)#  Folinic acid (leucovorin) is a reduced form of folic acid that can be used to counter the toxic effects of MTX chemotherapy.  Folinic acid selectively \"rescues\" normal cells by competing with MTX for DHF reductase binding sites.  It can reactivate DHF reductase, therefore allowing re-initiation of DNA synthesis. $#(Choice C)#  Para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) is a folic acid precursor in prokaryotes.

  "explanation_2": "$Cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, which help convert @arachidonic acid@ to thromboxane A2 and prostaglandins, exist in 2 primary forms: $• #COX-1#, which is constitutively expressed in physiologically functioning cells.  The major product of COX-1 in platelets is #thromboxane A2#, which promotes #platelet activation and aggregation# (eg, increased glycoprotein IIb/IIIa expression). $• COX-2, which is expressed in an inducible manner in response to cytokine release by immune cells (eg, macrophages).  Major products of this enzyme are prostaglandins, some of which promote fever, inflammation, and pain sensitivity. $#Aspirin#, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), primarily inhibits COX-1 when administered in low doses (ie, 81-324 mg/day).  Aspirin is unique compared to other NSAIDs because this #inhibition is irreversible# (via acetylation), resulting in a sustained decrease in thromboxane A2 production by platelets for the duration of their lifespan (ie, 3-7 days).  Therefore, aspirin has a prolonged antithrombotic effect and is commonly used to reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with coronary artery disease.  Because this inhibition of platelet aggregation lasts for the #platelet lifespan#, preoperative aspirin discontinuation is recommended #at least 5 days prior# to surgery to avoid excessive bleeding. $Higher aspirin doses significantly inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2, thereby also exhibiting antipyretic and analgesic effects due to decreased prostaglandin production.  However, other NSAIDs (eg, ibuprofen) are more commonly used for these indications because of a better efficacy and safety profile; notably, these medications reversibly inhibit COX-1 and COX-2 and therefore can be discontinued immediately prior to surgery. $#(Choices A and C)#  Aspirin and its active metabolite salicylate are transported to various tissues in a highly protein-bound state (ie, bound to albumin).  However, neither a delayed release from albumin nor persistence of active metabolites would explain the sustained antithrombotic effect (>5 days) because salicylate undergoes glucuronidation by the liver and elimination from the body within a day (half-life of 3-5 hr). $#(Choice D)#  Anticoagulants (eg, warfarin, rivaroxaban) are @major inhibitors@ of hepatic coagulation factor synthesis; however, aspirin does not affect coagulation factor synthesis in a clinically significant manner. $#(Choice E)#  Selective inhibition of the inducible form of COX (ie, COX-2) describes the mechanism of action of selective COX-2 inhibitors (eg, celecoxib).  However, aspirin is nonselective in its inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2. $#Educational objective# Aspirin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that primarily and irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) when given in low doses.  Because irreversible COX-1 inhibition decreases platelet thromboxane A2 production for the duration of their lifespan (ie, 3-7 days), preoperative aspirin discontinuation is recommended at least 5 days prior to surgery to avoid excessive bleeding.

  "explanation_2": "$The two antineoplastic agents described in the question stem are methotrexate (Drug X) and 5-fluorouracil (Drug Y).  Methotrexate is a folic acid analog that functions by binding and inactivating dihydrofolate reductase, the enzyme responsible for reducing folic acid to tetrahydrofolate.  Tetrahydrofolate participates in the transfer of carbon groups in certain intracellular reactions including purine and thymidine synthesis.  5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is a pyrimidine analog that primarily functions to inhibit DNA synthesis by inhibition of thymidylate synthetase after enzymatic conversion to its nucleotide floxuridine monophosphate by any of a number of intracellular reactions. $The key metabolic difference between methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil is that methotrexate prevents the reduction of folic acid to tetrahydrofolate, while 5-FU binds tetrahydrofolate and thymidylate synthetase in a stable-reaction intermediate form, thereby effectively decreasing the amount of thymidylate synthetase available for thymidine synthesis. $Leucovorin (N5-formyl-tetrahydrofolate) is a tetrahydrofolate derivative that does not require reduction by dihydrofolate reductase before it can function as a cofactor for thymidylate synthase and other enzymes involved with purine and amino acid synthesis.  Because leucovorin bypasses the dihydrofolate reductase step that is inhibited by methotrexate, it can be used to \"rescue\" normal cells from the toxicity of methotrexate.  5-FU, on the other hand, requires the presence of reduced folate in order to form complexes with thymidylate synthetase.  5-FU has a reduced cytotoxic effect in cells that are deficient in tetrahydrofolate.  For this reason, leucovorin can be utilized to potentiate the toxicity of fluoropyrimidines such as fluorouracil by strengthening the association of the drug with thymidylate synthase. $#(Choice A)# Cytarabine, like 5-FU, is also a pyrimidine analog antimetabolite that is incorporated into DNA leading to strand termination.  It does not affect folate metabolism.  Gemcitabine is another pyrimidine analog that functions much like cytarabine.  It differs from cytarabine in that it is not S-phase specific, likely owing to additional cytotoxic functions such as inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase. $#(Choice C)# Fludarabine is a deamination-resistant purine nucleotide analog that exerts its cytotoxicity by many mechanisms, including inhibition of DNA polymerase, DNA primase, DNA ligase, and ribonucleotide reductase.  Fludarabine is used to treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). $#Educational objective# Methotrexate and 5-FU both effectively inhibit thymidylate formation, but the chemotherapeutic effect of methotrexate is overcome by N5-formyl-tetrahydrofolate (folinic acid, leucovorin) supplementation.

The most common triggers of drug-induced hemolysis are anti-inflammatory medications, penicillins, and cephalosporins (eg, #ceftriaxone#).  Although the mechanism of erythrocyte injury (eg, oxidative, complement mediated) varies depending on the medication, penicillins and cephalosporins typically cause hemolysis by binding to the erythrocyte surface, which creates a #hapten for IgG attachment#.  Antibody-coated erythrocytes are then partially or wholly phagocytized by splenic macrophages, leading to #extravascular hemolysis#. $Hemolysis is often associated with symptomatic anemia (eg, fatigue, pallor) and signs of hyperbilirubinemia (eg, jaundice, dark urine).  Laboratory evaluation will typically reveal #elevated indirect bilirubin# (heme breakdown product), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (intracellular enzyme), reticulocytosis (increased immature RBCs), and lowered haptoglobin (binds free hemoglobin).  The diagnosis is confirmed with the #direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test#, which detects IgG or C3 (a complement fragment) on the erythrocyte surface.  Because hemolysis is triggered by the direct binding of the penicillin or cephalosporin to the erythrocyte membrane, #cessation of the offending drug# eliminates the antibody target and generally leads to complete resolution of symptoms within days. $#(Choice B)#  Anemia of chronic disease is caused by cytokine-mediated iron dysregulation.  Although chronic infection (eg, viral hepatitis, tuberculosis) is a common trigger, anemia of chronic disease is gradual in onset and is not associated with hyperbilirubinemia (no RBC lysis). $#(Choice C)#  Certain antibiotics (eg, sulfa medications, chloramphenicol) are associated with myelosuppression.  However, these medications generally cause pancytopenia, not isolated anemia; in addition, hyperbilirubinemia is not seen. $#(Choice D)#  Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is marked by hemolysis in the setting of oxidative stress due to infection, oxidizing medication, or oxidative foods.  Although this patient has an infection, ceftriaxone is not an oxidizing medication.  In addition, G6PD deficiency is X-linked; therefore, symptoms are less common in women. $#(Choice E)#  Severe infections can trigger disseminated intravascular coagulation, a consumptive coagulopathy associated with anemia due to erythrocyte injury from microvascular thrombi.  However, these patients have prolonged coagulation times and thrombocytopenia. $#Educational objective# Penicillins and cephalosporins are common triggers for drug-induced hemolytic anemia because they can bind to the erythrocyte surface and act as haptens for IgG attachment.

As a result, warfarin administration leads to prolongation of the prothrombin time (PT) and INR (ratio of a patient's PT compared to a normal control).  In patients with atrial fibrillation, deep venous thrombosis, or PE who are taking warfarin for anticoagulation, the dose is usually adjusted to achieve a target therapeutic INR range (generally 2.0-3.0). $Precise dosing of warfarin can be difficult due to its many interactions with other drugs that affect cytochrome P-450 activity, plasma protein binding, and/or gastrointestinal absorption.  Warfarin elimination occurs primarily through hepatic metabolism by cytochrome P-450 enzymes.  Drugs that #increase P-450 activity#, such as #phenytoin#, phenobarbital, and rifampin, #increase warfarin elimination# and decrease its anticoagulant activity (reflected as a subtherapeutic INR <2.0).

The extensive DNA damage inhibits replication and causes apoptosis of malignant cells.  However, nonmalignant cells are also affected and can aquire #new mutations# (due to erroneous DNA repair) that contribute to development of secondary malignancies.

In addition, the risk of #bladder cancer# is increased, although the mechanism likely involves toxic effects of acrolein (another cyclophosphamide metabolite) on bladder urothelial cells. $Other chemotherapeutic agents that can induce significant DNA damage in nonmalignant cells include additional alkylating agents (eg, cisplatin), #topoisomerase inhibitors# (eg, etoposide), and #anthracyclines# (eg, doxorubicin), each of which also carries a risk of secondary malignancy. $#(Choice A)#  Asparaginase is an enzyme that hydrolyzes asparagine, an essential amino acid for leukemic cells.  Without asparagine, leukemic cells cannot synthesize protein and therefore undergo apoptosis.  Asparaginase can cause hypersensitivity reactions but not secondary malignancy. $#(Choices C and D)#  Mercaptopurine and methotrexate are antimetabolites that interfere with nucleotide synthesis.  Although these drugs may be associated with a slight increased risk of secondary malignancy, the risk is not nearly as high as with agents that directly damage DNA. $#(Choice E)#  Prednisone is a glucocorticoid that can cause hypertension, hyperglycemia, and weight gain with prolonged use. $#(Choice F)#  Vincristine is a vinca alkaloid that inhibits microtubule assembly during mitosis.  Vincristine is associated with an increased risk for peripheral neuropathy, not secondary malignancy. $#Educational objective# Chemotherapeutic drugs that induce DNA damage increase the risk for secondary malignancy (eg, treatment-related myeloid neoplasms).

This creates an anticoagulant state that is reflected on laboratory assessment as a prolonged INR.  Because the effect of warfarin is significantly altered by certain foods and medications, patients on long-term warfarin are at risk for subtherapeutic or #supratherapeutic INR# due to any of the following: $• Change in dietary vitamin K intake: Increase in dietary vitamin K increases the availability of vitamin K in the liver, which counters the inhibitory effect of warfarin on epoxide reductase.  Therefore, patients on warfarin are advised to eat a consistent amount of vitamin K–containing foods (eg, leafy greens, brussels sprouts). $• #Disruption to intestinal flora:# Intestinal flora produce vitamin K as a byproduct of metabolism.  Therefore, antibiotics that target gram-negative bacteria such as metronidazole, macrolides, and fluroquinolones can cause supratherapeutic INR due to destruction of vitamin K–producing bacteria in the gut.  In this patient, the #administration of an antibiotic# (eg, ciprofloxacin) for pyelonephritis likely destroyed gram-negative bacteria in her gut, thereby #reducing vitamin K production# and causing a supratherapeutic INR. $• Alteration to cytochrome P450 2C9 activity: Several medications induce or inhibit cytochrome P450 2C9, which alters the speed of warfarin metabolism.  For instance, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampin increase cytochrome P450 2C9 activity, which can result in a subtherapeutic INR #(choice D).#  In contrast, metronidazole, fluconazole, and amiodarone inhibit cytochrome P450 2C9 activity, which can result in a supratherapeutic INR. $#(Choice A)#  Aspirin exerts an anticoagulation effect by inhibiting the release of thromboxane A2 by platelets, which subsequently reduces platelet aggregation.  This can lead to prolonged bleeding time but does not increase INR. $#(Choice C)#  Anticlotting factor antibodies can occasionally occur due to recent pregnancy, malignancy, or rheumatologic disease.  Most cases involve inhibition of factor VIII, which leads to a bleeding diathesis and prolonged aPTT (not INR, which reflects PT).  This patient with a recent infection treated with antibiotics is more likely to have supratherapeutic INR due to disruption of vitamin K production by intestinal flora. $#(Choice E)#  Increased dietary vitamin K leads to a subtherapeutic INR due to increased vitamin K availability in the liver. $#Educational objective# Patients on warfarin who take antibiotics that target gram-negative microorganisms (eg, metronidazole, macrolides, fluroquinolones) can develop supratherapeutic INR due to disruption of vitamin K–producing intestinal flora.

Following ingestion, 6-MP is converted by hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) into 6-thioguanine (6-TG) active metabolites #(choice C).#  The 6-TG metabolites are purine analogues that act as false nucleotides to disrupt DNA and RNA synthesis and inhibit the proliferation of hematopoietic cells, a useful effect in the treatment of autoimmune disease, organ transplant rejection, and some types of cancer (eg, leukemia). $6-MP is #metabolized into inactive metabolites# by 2 different enzymes, #xanthine oxidase# and #thiopurine methyltransferase# (TPMT), both of which are clinically important.  Coadministration of 6-MP with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor (eg, allopurinol, febuxostat) slows the inactivation of 6-MP and shunts metabolism toward the production of 6-TG active metabolites; therefore, the dose of 6-MP must be significantly reduced.  In addition, roughly 12% of the population has a genetic mutation resulting in low or absent activity of TPMT, creating a high risk of toxicity with the administration of 6-MP.  Therefore, some clinicians recommend that patients undergo genetic testing for TPMT activity prior to initiating 6-MP (or azathioprine) therapy. $#(Choice A)#  Adenosine deaminase (ADA) converts adenosine to inosine as part of purine metabolism.  This enzyme is deficient in severe combined immunodeficiency but may be overexpressed in some malignancies.  Cladribine, which is used in the treatment of hairy cell leukemia, is a cytotoxic purine analogue resistant to degradation by ADA. $#(Choice B)#  Methotrexate is used in the treatment of cancer and rheumatologic disease.  It inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, thereby blocking the conversion of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and disrupting the synthesis of thymidine and, to a lesser extent, purines. $#(Choice D)#  Monoamine oxidase inhibitors are used in the treatment of atypical depression; these agents inhibit degradation of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin. $#(Choice E)#  Cyclophosphamide, used to treat many types of cancer, requires bioactivation by the cytochrome P-450 mixed-function oxidase system. $#(Choice F)#  Topoisomerase II is inhibited by the chemotherapeutic agents etoposide and teniposide. $#Educational objective# 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) is an immunosuppression drug that is inactivated by 2 enzymes, xanthine oxidase and thiopurine methyltransferase.

  "explanation_2": "$#Warfarin# is a vitamin K antagonist that blocks #epoxide reductase# in the liver, leading to impaired vitamin K recycling.  This depletes the reduced form of vitamin K, which is required for gamma carboxylation of #vitamin K–dependent clotting factors# (II, VII, IX, and X).  In the absence of gamma carboxylation, vitamin K–dependent clotting factors cannot bind calcium or phospholipid membranes to induce coagulation. $Because warfarin inhibits gamma carboxylation of #new# vitamin K–dependent clotting factors, therapeutic efficacy is delayed until #preexisting clotting factors# in the plasma are consumed.  Although INR tends to slowly increase in the first few days of administration due to the short half-life of factor VII (4-6 hours), full #therapeutic effect# does not typically occur for #3 days# due to the long half-life of #factor II#. $Warfarin also inhibits gamma carboxylation of the proteins C and S.  Because these proteins exert an anticoagulant effect, the initiation of warfarin can be associated with an initial procoagulant state.  However, once preexisting vitamin K–dependent clotting factors are consumed, an anticoagulant effect is established. $#(Choice B)#  Anti-platelet factor 4/heparin antibodies cause heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, which typically arise 5-10 days after heparin initiation.  This condition is marked by thrombocytopenia and a high risk of arterial and venous thrombosis, but would not result in a delay in therapeutic INR following warfarin administration. $#(Choice C)#  Total body vitamin K is sufficient for several weeks; it does not contribute to a delay in warfarin efficacy.  However, increased intake of foods rich in vitamin K (eg, green leafy vegetables) can lead to subtherapeutic INR due to increased vitamin K availability in the liver. $#(Choice D)#  Warfarin is metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 2C9 enzyme.  Because many other medications induce or inhibit this enzyme, warfarin is susceptible to a wide range of drug interactions.  However, the delay in achieving therapeutic INR is primarily due to the presence of preexisting clotting factors. $#(Choice E)#  Warfarin reaches maximal plasma concentration approximately 90 minutes after administration.  The delay in efficacy is due to the presence of preexisting clotting factors. $#Educational objective# Warfarin blocks epoxide reductase, which lowers the reduced form of vitamin K in the liver; this prevents gamma carboxylation of vitamin K–dependent clotting factors (II, VII, IX, and X).  Because warfarin only blocks the generation of new clotting factors, therapeutic effect is delayed 3-5 days until preexisting clotting factors are consumed.  "

This altered form of hemoglobin is called #hemoglobin S# (Hb S); unlike normal adult hemoglobin (Hb A), Hb S polymerizes when deoxygenated or dehydrated, leading to erythrocyte membrane damage (ie, intravascular #hemolysis#) and clogging of small vessels (ie, painful #vasoocclusive crises#, ischemia). $Heterozygotes for Hb S are usually asymptomatic because there is enough Hb A to prevent extensive polymerization of Hb S, but homozygotes typically have severe disease.  These individuals often require repeated blood transfusions for symptomatic anemia and treatment with #hydroxyurea#, an antimetabolite that inhibits the ribonucleotide reductase enzyme.  Although inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase leads to the myelosuppressive effects of hydroxyurea (it causes cell cycle arrest in rapidly dividing hematopoietic cells), hydroxyurea also shifts globin gene transcription from the beta globin locus to the #gamma globin# locus (via unclear mechanisms), thereby #increasing #circulating levels of #fetal hemoglobin# (HB F). $HB F is unaffected by the sickle cell mutation (because it is not composed of beta chains) and has physiologic properties similar to hemoglobin A; therefore, hydroxyurea is often used in the treatment of SCD to improve oxygen delivery, reduce vasoocclusive crises, and lessen need for transfusions. $#(Choice A)#  The calcium-dependent (Gardos) potassium channel regulates the transport of potassium and water through the erythrocyte membrane; blocking this channel could help prevent erythrocyte dehydration but has not been shown to improve symptoms. $#(Choice B)#  Voxelotor directly inhibits polymerization of Hb S by binding to the alpha chain of the molecule and causing an allosteric change that results in increased oxygen binding. $#(Choice C)#  Hb A2 is a variant of normal adult hemoglobin that has 2 delta chains instead of 2 beta chains.  Because it does not contain the abnormal beta chains, increased hemoglobin A2 could reduce sickle cell crises.  However, hydroxyurea increases gamma globulin expression, not delta globulin expression. $#(Choice E)#  L-glutamine, a precursor to the antioxidant glutathione, reduces oxidative stress in erythrocytes with HB S.  It is used for patients with SCD who have persistent vasoocclusive pain or those who cannot tolerate hydroxyurea. $#(Choice F)#  Stimulation of erythrocyte production (eg, erythropoietin) would likely worsen vasoocclusive crises by increasing circulating levels of Hb S.  Hydroxyurea inhibits (not stimulates) the production of erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets by blocking ribonucleotide reductase; however, patients with SCD still benefit from administration due to stimulated HB F production. $#Educational objective# Hydroxyurea is used in patients with sickle cell disease to increase expression of gamma globin chains, which leads to increased circulating fetal hemoglobin (Hb F) concentration.

AA is a form of #bone marrow failure# caused by damage to #multipotent hematopoietic stem cells#.  Most cases are induced by direct toxicity to hematopoietic stem cells or an alteration to stem cell surface antigens, which leads to their subsequent destruction by cytotoxic lymphocytes. $Although AA can be idiopathic, it is often triggered by ionizing radiation, toxic chemicals, viral infections, or medications.  Drug-induced AA is typically categorized as follows: $• #Dose-dependent reactions# are caused by medications (eg, chemotherapy, immunosuppressives) that are toxic to the bone marrow when drug levels exceed a certain concentration for a certain period.  They tend to be predictable in onset. $• #Idiosyncratic reactions# are often caused by antiseizure medications (eg, #carbamazepine#, valproic acid), sulfonamides, or nifedipine.

Proliferation of neoplastic plasma cells in the bone marrow often causes bone pain (eg, back pain), hypercalcemia (eg, polyuria), and osteolytic lesions; patients also frequently develop normocytic anemia and renal insufficiency.  Treatment frequently includes medications that inhibit proteasome activity (eg, bortezomib) or increase ubiquitination of regulatory proteins produced in excess in neoplastic cells (eg, #lenalidomide#). $Lenalidomide is a derivative of thalidomide, an antiemetic agent used in pregnancy until significant teratogenic effects were identified.  Lenalidomide increases the binding affinity of the #E3 ubiquitin ligase complex# to specific #transcription factors# (TFs) (eg, Ikaros and Aiolos 2 zinc finger transcription factors) that are overexpressed in myeloma cells.  Binding attaches ubiquitin to the TFs, which leads to their subsequent #destruction by the proteasome#.  Because these TFs are required for myeloma cell survival, diminished intracellular concentrations cause cell death.  Other mature B-cell malignancies such as mantle cell lymphoma and myelodysplastic syndrome (some cases are caused by B-cell proliferation) also overexpress these TFs; therefore, lenalidomide is often effective against these neoplasms. $#(Choice A)#  TFs are proteins that bind to a specific DNA sequence to increase or suppress its transcription to messenger RNA; they are not expressed on the cell surface. $#(Choice B)#  Lysosomes are membrane-bound organelles with hydrolytic enzymes that break down molecules from outside the cell (via endocytosis) or within the cytoplasm (autophagy).

In contrast, phosphorylation or acetylation can affect TF binding to promoter regions of DNA. $#(Choice E)#  Proteins targeted for the nucleus have nuclear localization signals, short chains of amino acids that promote transport into the nucleus.  These are added during protein synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum; ubiquitination does not affect nuclear localization. $#Educational objective# Multiple myeloma is often treated with medications that block proteasome activity (eg, bortezomib) or increase ubiquitination of specific transcription factors (eg, lenalidomide).

  "explanation_2": "The genetic mutations that drive oncogenesis also create unique proteins not found in healthy cells.  Antigens from these proteins (#neoantigens#) are displayed on the surface of tumor cells and may be subsequently recognized by patrolling cytotoxic T cells as \"not-self\" and destroyed.  Cancers with defects in #mismatch repair proteins# and high microsatellite instability (reflecting DNA polymerase errors during cellular replication) are particularly susceptible to #immune recognition# because they rapidly accumulate mutations and generate approximately 20-fold more neoantigens than tumor cells that have normal mismatch repair. $Cancer cells use a wide range of mechanisms to thwart cytotoxic T-cell detection, including: $• Downregulating cell surface receptors involved in immune recognition.  For instance, decreased expression of the major histocompatibility complex leads to decreased neoantigen presentation on the surface of the cell. $• Overexpressing cell surface proteins that inhibit the immune response.  For instance, cancer cells can overexpress @programmed death-ligand 1@ (PD-L1), which binds to the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) receptor on the T-cell surface and inhibits the cytotoxic T-cell response (T-cell exhaustion). $Cancer cells that overexpress PD-L1 are less susceptible to cytotoxic T-cell–mediated destruction (enhanced T-cell exhaustion).  These tumors can be treated with #monoclonal antibodies# that block the PD-1 receptor on T cells (eg, pembrolizumab, nivolumab) or the PD-1 ligand on cancer cells (eg, atezolizumab).  Treatment stimulates the cytotoxic T-cell response; it is particularly effective against tumors with large quantities of neoantigens (eg, those with deficits in mismatch repair) because these tumors are particularly susceptible to recognition as \"not-self.\" $#(Choice A)#  P-glycoprotein is a multidrug transporter that can be used by cancer cells to pump cytotoxic chemotherapy out of the cell. $#(Choice C)#  KRAS is a proto-oncogene that is part of the signaling pathway for the epidermal growth factor receptor.  Activating mutations in KRAS lead to unregulated cellular growth.  Tumors with activating mutations to KRAS are resistant to monoclonal antibodies against epidermal growth factor receptor because they have an activating mutation in a downstream signal. $#(Choice D)#  p53 is a tumor-suppressor protein that inhibits cellular replication when DNA is damaged and induces apoptosis.  Mutations to p53 can lead to unregulated cellular growth and may inhibit cytotoxic chemotherapy–mediated cancer cell apoptosis. $#(Choice E)#  Desmoplasia (dense fibrosis) around a tumor can reduce the ability of cytotoxic chemotherapy to enter cancer cells. $#Educational objective# Cancer cells avoid immune recognition by overexpressing programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), which binds to the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) receptor on cytotoxic T cells and inhibits their response (T-cell exhaustion).  Monoclonal antibodies that block PD-L1 and PD-1 are effective against cancers that express high levels of neoantigens on their surface because these tumors are particularly susceptible to immune recognition by cytotoxic T cells.

  "explanation_2": "#Wound dehiscence# is partial or complete separation of previously approximated wound edges.  It occurs due to disruption of the wound-healing process and may be a complication of medications such as bevacizumab. $#Bevacizumab# is a monoclonal antibody that #binds vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)#, preventing it from binding to its cell surface receptor.  This #inhibits angiogenesis#—the process by which new blood vessels sprout from surrounding, uninjured vessels and grow into the wound—because angiogenesis is largely stimulated by VEGF. $Because bevacizumab suppresses the growth of new blood vessels, it limits the blood supply to the tumor and is often referred to as cancer-starving therapy.  However, because it also suppresses angiogenesis in healing wounds, it can cause wound dehiscence.  The lack of angiogenesis leads to #inadequate blood supply# to support #collagen production# during the @proliferation phase@ (3 days to 5 weeks) and collagen #remodeling and cross-linking# during the maturation phase (3 weeks to 2 yr).  When these are inhibited, the #tensile strength# of the wound remains #low#, and dehiscence can occur even weeks to months after initial wound closure. $#(Choice B)#  Radiation therapy, commonly used in cancer treatment, causes DNA damage, resulting in apoptosis of susceptible (eg, highly proliferative) cells.  However, it also damages surrounding noncancerous tissues, including local blood vessels, which can subsequently develop progressive eccentric myointimal proliferation and luminal obstruction.  This can eventually result in tissue ischemia (eg, chronic skin ulcers). $#(Choice C)#  Vinca alkaloids such as vincristine and vinblastine inhibit cytoskeleton microtubule development.  This results in the arrest of cell division and replication at the @metaphase stage@, leading to failure of division and cell death. $#(Choice D)#  Anti-inflammatory agents such as glucocorticoids can impair inflammatory cell migration to the wound site.  Suppression of inflammation, the wound-healing phase that precedes proliferation, can delay the progression of wound healing. $#(Choice E)#  Vitamin C deficiency can result in inadequate hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues during collagen synthesis.  Because hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine are essential for collagen cross-linking, vitamin C deficiency compromises collagen cross-linking and reduces the maximal tensile strength of the wound. $#Educational objective# Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the binding of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to its receptor.

The international normalized ratio (INR) is a standardized PT.  The target INR for therapeutic warfarin anticoagulation is 2-3.

  "explanation_2": "This patient with sickle cell disease (SCD) has #pancytopenia#, a decrease in all 3 blood cell lineages.  Pancytopenia is caused by hematopoietic stem cell dysfunction, bone marrow infiltration, or peripheral destruction of mature blood cells.  Important clues in this case include: $• #Low reticulocyte count:#  Patients with severe anemia usually have increased reticulocytes due to enhanced bone marrow erythropoiesis.  The presence of pancytopenia with an #inappropriately low# reticulocyte count usually indicates the #bone marrow is impaired# and is unable to adequately generate new cells despite strong growth signals (eg, increased erythropoietin). $• #Macrocytosis:#  Although macrocytosis can be seen in a wide range of pathologies, the presence of pancytopenia plus macrocytosis usually indicates a vitamin deficiency (eg, vitamin B12, folate) or a medication (eg, hydroxyurea) is #impairing DNA synthesis# in hematopoietic cells. $#Hydroxyurea #inhibits #ribonucleoside reductase#, an enzyme that generates deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates for #DNA synthesis/repair#.  A lack of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates slows erythrocyte nuclear development, leading to decreased cellular division with an overall increase in erythrocyte size.  High doses of hydroxyurea also impair nuclear development in precursors of leukocytes and thrombocytes, leading to pancytopenia. $Hydroxyurea is the major disease-modifying medication in SCD; it reduces production of the mutated beta globulin gene and increases production of the fetal hemoglobin gene, which increases fetal hemoglobin (HbF).  Because HbF functions normally, erythrocytes with increased HbF are less likely to sickle in the microvasculature. $#(Choice A)#  Autoimmune hemolytic anemia is associated with high (not low) reticulocytes due to increased erythropoiesis.  Because reticulocytes are larger (MCV 125-135 µm3) than mature erythrocytes, reticulocytosis can cause macrocytosis; however, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia would not be seen. $#(Choice B)#  Folate is a methyl group donor for the synthesis of purines and pyrimidines.  Folate deficiency impairs DNA synthesis, which can lead to pancytopenia and macrocytosis.  However, this patient is taking folic acid, making deficiency unlikely. $#(Choice C)#  Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is an acquired disorder of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells marked by lack of @complement inhibitor@ on the erythrocyte surface.  Hemolytic anemia is the primary manifestation; reticulocytosis is common, and pancytopenia rarely occurs. $#(Choice E)#  SCD can cause hypersplenism due to splenic congestion with damaged erythrocytes.  Although this can occasionally cause pancytopenia, patients with hypersplenism usually have splenomegaly and normocytic (not macrocytic) anemia. $#Educational objective# Hydroxyurea increases fetal hemoglobin production, which reduces erythrocyte sickling in patients with sickle cell disease.  It also inhibits ribonucleoside reductase, which decreases deoxynucleoside triphosphates available for DNA synthesis; this leads to macrocytosis and, with high doses, pancytopenia.  ",

Another useful laboratory value is the #International Normalized Ratio (INR)#, a ratio of the patient's PT to a control (usual INR target for AF: 2.0-3.0).  Examples of indications include AF, deep venous thrombosis, and pulmonary thromboembolism.  Outpatients who take warfarin typically have their INR checked every few weeks (more frequently initially). $The most common side effect is excessive anticoagulation leading to bleeding (which can require vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma if rapid reversal is needed).  Skin necrosis can occur during the first few days of treatment due to a transient hypercoagulable state (reduction in protein C anticoagulant activity before affecting other factors' procoagulant activity); for this reason, heparin is typically administered temporarily at the start of warfarin therapy (\"heparin bridge\").

  "explanation_2": "#Hemophilia A# is an X-linked, recessive bleeding disorder caused by mutations to the gene that encodes clotting# factor VIII#.  Factor VIII is part of the @intrinsic coagulation cascade@; it acts as a bridging protein that brings together the catalytic component of #factor IXa# (the protease) with #factor X# (the substrate), thereby amplifying formation of factor Xa, which promotes fibrin clots. $Patients with hemophilia A have severe reductions in factor VIII and are unable to form fibrin clots at sites of minor trauma, leading to potentially life-threatening hemarthroses and mucosal bleeding.  Treatment with factor VIII replacement products (eg, factor VIII concentrate from plasma) can prevent or treat bleeding in these patients.  However, long-term efficacy is often limited by the formation of neutralizing antibodies #(factor VIII inhibitors)#. $#Emicizumab#, a bispecific monoclonal antibody, mimics the normal physiologic function of factor VIII and can be used to prevent or treat bleeding in patients who have factor VIII inhibitors.  This antibody has 2 binding sites; one site binds to factor IXa and the other binds to factor X, which brings them into #close proximity# and allows factor IXa to cleave factor X into its active form (Xa). $#(Choice A)#  Von Willebrand factor, a large glycoprotein produced by the endothelium, aids platelet clot formation by binding platelets to subendothelial collagen at sites of injury.  It is also a carrier protein for factor VIII; therefore, patients with Von Willebrand factor deficiency often have mild or moderate reductions in factor VIII.  However, serious bleeding (eg, hemarthroses) is very uncommon. $#(Choice B)#  Activation of factor X to Xa can also occur via the extrinsic (tissue factor pathway) in response to tissue trauma.  In this case, factor VIIa in combination with tissue factor activates factor X.  This pathway does not require factor VIII and is unaffected in those with hemophilia A. $#(Choice C)#  Ultra-large von Willebrand factor multimers produced by the endothelium are cleaved to smaller subunits by the metalloprotease ADAMTS13.  Loss of ADAMTS13 activity leads to thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. $#(Choice D)#  Factor XIIIa cross-links loose fibrin molecules into a dense network, thereby forming stable fibrin clots.  Factor XIIIa is unaffected in those with hemophilia A. $#Educational objective# Hemophilia A is an X-linked disorder associated with a deficiency of factor VIII.  Emicizumab—a bispecific, monoclonal antibody—mimics the activity of factor VIII by binding to both factor IXa and factor X, bringing them into close proximity to allow for factor X activation.  ",

  "explanation_2": "#Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting# (CINV) is a common side effect of cancer treatment.  It is caused by both peripheral and central mechanisms, as follows: $• #Acute-phase CINV# (<24 hours after chemotherapy) is mediated primarily by the release of #serotonin# from intestinal enterochromaffin cells that have been damaged by chemotherapy.  Serotonin stimulates vagal afferent fibers (5-HT3 receptors) in the bowel wall, which project to the brainstem and stimulate the vomiting reflex.  Therefore, #serotonin receptor antagonists# (eg, ondansetron) can be used for treatment. $• #Delayed-phase CINV# (1-5 days after chemotherapy) is mediated primarily by increased levels of #substance P# in the brainstem due to chemotherapy-associated emetic stimuli in the cerebrospinal fluid and bloodstream.  Substance P binds to and activates the #neurokinin-1# (NK1) #receptor# in areas of the brainstem that mediate vomiting (eg, nucleus tractus solitarius, area postrema).  Therefore, #NK1 receptor antagonists# (eg, aprepitant, fosaprepitant) are often used for treatment. $Most patients who undergo chemotherapy associated with a high risk of vomiting (eg, cisplatin) receive a combination of serotonin receptor antagonists and NK1 receptor antagonists (often with other antiemetics) to prevent both types of CINV. $#(Choice B)#  Malignancy-related anorexia is the loss of muscle and fat caused by elevated levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines.  Progesterone analogs (eg, megestrol acetate) are the first-line treatment; corticosteroids and cannabinoids are also frequently used. $#(Choice C)#  Malignancy-related hypercalcemia is typically treated with bisphosphonates (eg, zoledronic acid), which reduce osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. $#(Choice D)#  Opioid-induced constipation occurs due to opioid-mediated effects on the bowel wall, which reduce peristalsis.  Methylnaltrexone, an opioid antagonist that has limited ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (it does not trigger withdrawal), can be used as treatment. $#(Choice E)#  Patients who have highly aggressive lymphomas and leukemias are at risk for tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) with chemotherapy.  Its primary manifestation is renal damage from elevated uric acid levels (catabolism of nucleic acids released from tumor cells increases uric acid).  Rasburicase, a drug that breaks down uric acid, is used to prevent TLS in high-risk patients. $#Educational objective# Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting is mediated by peripheral and central mechanisms.  It can be treated with serotonin receptor antagonists (eg, ondansetron) to prevent serotonin stimulation of afferent vagal fibers in the bowel wall (peripheral cause) and neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists (eg, aprepitant) to prevent the effects of substance P in the brainstem (central cause).

  "explanation_2": "$This clinical trial is studying a #thiazolidinedione# (TZD), a class of medications that #decrease insulin resistance#, a key pathologic factor in both type 2 diabetes mellitus and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). $TZDs (eg, pioglitazone) bind to #peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor gamma# (PPAR-γ), a transcriptional regulator of genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism.  The activated complex then binds to the transcriptional regulatory sequences to upregulate target genes that enhance insulin sensitivity, including: $#Glucose transporter-4#, an insulin-responsive, transmembrane glucose transporter expressed in adipocytes and skeletal myocytes that increases glucose uptake by target cells $#Adiponectin#, a cytokine secreted by fat tissue that increases the number of insulin-responsive adipocytes and stimulates fatty acid oxidation #(choice B)# $TZDs are functionally similar to fibrate medications (eg, fenofibrate, gemfibrozil), which bind PPAR-α and are effective in lowering blood triglyceride levels.  The PPAR family of transcriptional regulators also plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome (obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance), and their activation and subsequent increase in insulin sensitivity are thought to reverse the histologic changes in NASH. $#(Choice C)#  PPAR-γ activation leads to an increase in fat mass secondary to the increased differentiation of preadipocytes into mature adipocytes.  The increased movement of free fatty acids into fat cells, along with increased fatty acid oxidation (adiponectin effect), causes circulating free fatty acid levels to decrease. $#(Choice D)#  TZDs do not stimulate insulin secretion; rather, as insulin resistance diminishes, circulating levels of insulin tend to decrease over time. $#(Choice E)#  Leptin is a hormone secreted by fat cells that acts on the hypothalamus to decrease appetite.  Although PPAR-γ activation increases fat cell mass, circulating leptin levels remain unchanged or decrease due to the inhibiting effect of PPAR-γ on leptin gene transcription. $#Educational objective# Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) activate peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor gamma, a nuclear receptor that alters the transcription of genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism.  The resulting decrease in insulin resistance lowers blood glucose and can help reverse nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.  "

  "explanation_2": "$The beta cells of the pancreas produce #basal insulin# continuously at a low level to suppress on-going hepatic gluconeogenesis.  After meals, insulin secretion increases briefly to control the #postprandial# rise in blood glucose.  Commercial insulin analogues with different pharmacokinetics can be given subcutaneously to replicate physiologic insulin secretion: $• #Long-acting insulins# (eg, glargine) mimic basal insulin secretion; they have an extended duration of action and little or no peak effect.  They are typically given once daily and suppress #fasting hyperglycemia,# which is predominantly caused by inappropriate hepatic gluconeogenesis. $• #Rapid-acting insulins# (eg, lispro, aspart) are given to mimic the effects of postprandial insulin; they #peak quickly# and are then rapidly cleared.  They are given prior to meals so that the peak effect coincides with postmeal glucose excursions; they control #postprandial hyperglycemia#.  Because they are quickly cleared, they have minimal effect on fasting glucose levels. $This patient has normal fasting glucose levels, suggesting that his long-acting basal insulin regimen is appropriate but that he has elevated postprandial glucose.  His postprandial hyperglycemia is best treated with a #rapid-acting premeal insulin analogue#, such as #aspart#, lispro, or glulisine.  Regular insulin also can be given before mealtimes but has a more delayed peak onset and a longer duration of action compared to rapid-acting insulin analogues (which have amino acid changes that accelerate hexamer dissociation compared to regular insulin). $#(Choices B, C, and D)#  Insulins @degludec, detemir, and glargine@ have long durations of action due to structural modifications (eg, polymerizing residues, fatty acid side chains) that delay absorption and distribution.  They have minimal peak effect and are used as basal insulin substitutes. $#(Choice E)#  @NPH@, an intermediate-acting crystalline suspension of insulin with zinc/protamine, can be given twice daily when used as basal insulin.  However, unlike other basal insulins, it has a noticeable peak effect and can lead to hypoglycemia if the peak does not correspond to a meal (eg, nocturnal hypoglycemia), making it a less preferable option for this use. $#Educational objective# Long-acting insulin analogues (eg, glargine) have an extended duration of action without a noticeable peak in activity and are typically given once daily to mimic basal insulin secretion.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient's nocturnal back pain, spinal tenderness, and indurated prostate suggest #prostate adenocarcinoma# with bony metastases.  Prostate cancer is an #androgen-dependent# tumor.  Because most androgens (eg, testosterone) in men are made in the Leydig cells of the testes, initial treatment focuses on a systemic reduction in androgen production via surgical or medical #orchiectomy#. $Androgen production is primarily regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis.  Neurons in the hypothalamus release #GnRH# into the hypothalamic-pituitary portal system in a #pulsatile pattern# every 90-120 minutes.  This stimulates pituitary gonadotrophs to release luteinizing hormone (#LH#) into the circulation, which then binds to a surface receptor on Leydig cells and stimulates androgen production. $In medical orchiectomy, a #GnRH analogue# (eg, #leuprolide#) is administered to continuously stimulate pituitary gonadotrophs, which leads to down-regulation of the GnRH receptor, lower LH release, and reduced testicular androgen production.  However, because GnRH analogues #initially stimulate# pituitary gonadotrophs prior to the down-regulation of the receptor, most patients have a #transient increase in systemic androgens# during the first week of therapy (upward portion of graph).  This effect is generally blunted by administering a short course of androgen receptor antagonist medication (eg, bicalutamide) during treatment initiation in order to prevent worsening of the underlying prostate cancer. $#(Choices A and C)#  GnRH analogues stimulate the GnRH receptor prior to down-regulation, resulting in a transient increase in LH and systemic androgen production prior to down-regulation of the receptor. $#(Choice D)#  The enzyme 5-alpha reductase converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in peripheral tissues (eg, skin, liver); as testosterone levels fall, DHT production will decrease concurrently.  GnRH analogues have no effect on the activity of 5-alpha reductase, therefore, testosterone and DHT levels rise and fall in synchrony following GnRH administration. $#(Choice E)#  Benign prostatic hyperplasia is typically treated with a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor (eg, finasteride), which reduces the conversion of testosterone to DHT.  This class of medications reduces DHT levels while testosterone levels remain largely unaffected. $#Educational objective# Leuprolide is a GnRH agonist used to treat prostate cancer.  It initially stimulates pituitary LH secretion, which leads to a rise in androgen levels.  However, the GnRH receptor is subsequently down-regulated, which dramatically drops LH release and leads to a long-term decrease in androgen production.  "

Sulfonylureas are not typically preferred second-line agents; however, they are affordable and may be used as add-on therapy or as a replacement for metformin when cost is a major concern. $#Sulfonylureas# inhibit the ATP-sensitive potassium channel on the pancreatic beta cell membrane, inducing depolarization and L-type calcium channel opening.  The increased Ca2+ influx stimulates beta cell #insulin release independent# of blood glucose concentrations (eg, even when blood glucose levels are normal or low).  Therefore, a main associated risk is #hypoglycemia#.  Circumstances that can lead to hypoglycemia include exercise, missed meals, or initiation of additional antidiabetic medications.  Longer-acting sulfonylureas (eg, glyburide) are more prone to causing hypoglycemia than shorter-acting drugs (eg, glipizide) and are therefore not preferred. $#(Choice A)#  Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) helps regulate glucose by slowing gastric emptying and increasing insulin release in response to food intake.  Pharmacologic GLP-1 agonists (eg, exenatide) lower blood glucose and promote weight loss; these agents are associated with acute pancreatitis. $#(Choice B)#  In patients with poor oral intake (eg, gastroenteritis) or in those who are on concurrent diuretics (eg, furosemide), osmotic diuresis caused by sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors can lead to additional dehydration, resulting in acute kidney injury.  In the long term, however, SGLT2 inhibitors have renoprotective effects and are recommended in patients with diabetic nephropathy. $#(Choice D)#  Metformin can decrease absorption of vitamin B12, leading to B12 deficiency in long-term use.  Sulfonylureas do not have a significant effect on vitamin B12 metabolism. $#(Choice E)#  SGLT2 inhibitors (eg, dapagliflozin) decrease renal reabsorption of glucose, leading to increased urinary glucose loss and lower blood glucose levels.  The excess glucose in the urine can increase the risk of urinary tract infections and vulvovaginal candidiasis. $#Educational objective# Sulfonylureas inhibit the ATP-sensitive potassium channel on the pancreatic beta cell membrane, inducing depolarization and L-type calcium channel opening.  The increased Ca2+ influx stimulates beta cell insulin release independent of blood glucose concentrations, increasing the risk of hypoglycemia when meals are missed or during exercise.  "

To prevent injury, counterregulatory systems raise blood glucose in response to hypoglycemia via sympathetic nervous system activation (ie, norepinephrine/#epinephrine# release) and increase secretion of #glucagon#, cortisol, and growth hormone. $Symptoms of hypoglycemia fall into 2 general categories: neurogenic (autonomic) and neuroglycopenic. $• #Neurogenic symptoms# are mediated via norepinephrine/epinephrine and acetylcholine release during sympathetic stimulation.  Symptoms due to #norepinephrine/epinephrine# include tremulousness, tachycardia, and anxiety/arousal, whereas #acetylcholine# causes sweating, hunger, and paresthesias. $• #Neuroglycopenic symptoms# are due to inadequate availability of glucose in the CNS and include behavioral changes, confusion, visual disturbances, stupor, and seizures. $This patient has #reduced awareness# of hypoglycemia, likely due to the use of a #nonselective beta blocker# (eg, propranolol) for chronic treatment of migraines and/or hypertension.  Nonselective beta blockers attenuate the norepinephrine/epinephrine-mediated symptoms of hypoglycemia, but cholinergic symptoms (eg, hunger) are unaffected.

When administered in a pulsatile fashion (eg, intermittent intravenous infusion), leuprolide has GnRH agonist properties; however, #chronic administration# (eg, depot injection) results in a @continuous GnRH effect@ that leads to downregulation of GnRH receptors on gonadotropin cells in the pituitary gland.  This suppresses pituitary LH release and leads to #reduced# production of #testosterone# by Leydig cells.  Lower levels of circulating testosterone produce a clinical effect similar to that of surgical orchiectomy. $In male patients, androgens (eg, testosterone) are #aromatized to estrogens# that preserve bone density by reducing expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B (RANK) on @osteoclast precursors@ and inducing production of osteoprotegerin (decoy receptor that opposes RANK-ligand) by osteoblasts.

However, the vitamin D–PTH axis is not significantly influenced by leuprolide. $#(Choice E)#  Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM) is a paraneoplastic syndrome due to release of PTH-related protein (PTHrP) by malignant cells.  PTHrP is structurally similar to PTH and acts on the PTH-1 receptor.  HHM is most commonly seen in squamous cell carcinoma (eg, lung), transitional cell carcinomas, and breast and ovarian cancers.

It is most commonly due to excess prolactin, which directly stimulates milk secretion in the breasts.  Pituitary lactotroph adenomas (#prolactinomas#) can cause very high prolactin levels and are a common cause of galactorrhea. $Unlike most pituitary hormones, which are under positive regulation by releasing hormones from the hypothalamus, prolactin is primarily under @negative regulation@ by hypothalamic dopaminergic neurons via the pituitary stalk.  Because of the tonic inhibitory effect of dopamine on prolactin secretion, #dopamine agonists# (eg, cabergoline, bromocriptine) can be used to treat hyperprolactinemia.  Dopamine agonist therapy reduces adenoma size, suppresses prolactin production, and, in patients with small (<1 cm, as in this patient) prolactinomas and no mass-effect symptoms (eg, headache, visual field defects), can often induce a prolonged clinical response. $#(Choices A and C)#  Estrogen stimulates prolactin gene transcription and secretion.  Strongly estrogenic medications (eg, birth control pills) can potentially worsen rather than alleviate galactorrhea.  Dopamine antagonists (eg, antipsychotics) directly increase prolactin secretion and also can worsen galactorrhea. $#(Choice B)#  Hyperprolactinemia causes amenorrhea in women due to the inhibitory effect of prolactin on hypothalamic GnRH release.  Dopaminergic medications suppress prolactin secretion and can restore normal GnRH secretion. $#(Choice E)#  Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulates secretion of prolactin by lactotrophs, although its role in regulating prolactin release is secondary to the inhibition of prolactin secretion by dopamine.  Factors that increase TRH release would worsen hyperprolactinemia. $#Educational objective# Galactorrhea is abnormal secretion of breast milk not associated with pregnancy or breastfeeding.  It is most commonly due to excess prolactin, as seen in prolactin-secreting pituitary adenomas.

In the event of a nuclear accident, #potassium iodide# is given prophylactically to protect the thyroid from excessive accumulation of radioactive 131I. $Energy-dependent transport of inorganic iodide into the thyroid follicular cell (iodide trapping) is accomplished by the sodium-iodide symporter located on the basolateral membrane.  Because this transporter takes up all isotopes of iodide (as well as other ions such as perchlorate and pertechnetate), high serum levels of nonradioactive iodide can #competitively inhibit# radioactive I131 from entering thyroid follicular cells.  Large increases in serum iodide levels also inhibit iodine organification (Wolff-Chaikoff effect) and reduce thyroid hormone release. $#(Choice A)#  Levothyroxine is a synthetic form of T4 used to treat hypothyroidism.  High doses of levothyroxine suppress TSH, just as high amounts of natural T4 would.  Because TSH stimulates iodine trapping, high doses of levothyroxine would ultimately reduce iodine uptake in the thyroid follicular cells.

  "explanation_2": "$Estrogens are synthesized primarily by the aromatization of androgens.  #Aromatase# belongs to the P450 superfamily and is highly expressed in #ovarian tissue# (in which expression is #gonadotropin dependent#).  Aromatase is also expressed in the adrenal cortex, subcutaneous fat, and breast.  In the postmenopausal state, follicular atresia leads to reduced numbers of granulosa cells and decreased ovarian estrogen synthesis.  However, the ovaries and adrenal glands continue to produce androgens in significant quantities, and #extraovarian aromatase# maintains a low level of estrogen in the peripheral circulation. $Estrogen is the main hormone driving the growth and development of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive malignant breast tumors.  #Aromatase inhibitors# (eg, anastrozole, letrozole, exemestane) reduce the synthesis of estrogen from androgens, suppressing estrogen levels in postmenopausal women and #slowing progression of ER-positive tumors#.  They are less effective as monotherapy in premenopausal women, as ovarian aromatase is upregulated substantially in response to gonadotropins. $#(Choice B)#  Although inhibition of androgen synthesis could theoretically decrease estrogen synthesis, most androgen synthesis inhibitors (eg, ketoconazole) are nonspecific and suppress other pathways of steroidogenesis (eg, cortisol, mineralocorticoid). $#(Choice C)#  Pulsatile stimulation of the pituitary by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) increases secretion of LH and FSH.  However, continuous GnRH stimulation by long-acting GnRH analogs (eg, goserelin) suppresses LH and FSH release, decreasing production of estrogens in the ovarian follicle.  These agents are useful for ovarian suppression in premenopausal women with ER-positive breast cancer. $#(Choice D)#  Tamoxifen acts as either an antagonist or a partial agonist of the estrogen receptor, depending on the tissue.  In breast tissue, tamoxifen antagonizes the estrogen receptor and can be used as adjuvant therapy for ER-positive breast cancer. $#(Choice E)#  Many breast cancers overexpress epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2).  Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody against HER2 that is used in patients with HER2-positive tumors.  It inhibits MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways, increases degradation of HER2, and facilitates antibody-mediated destruction of tumor cells. $#Educational objective# Estrogen is the main hormone responsible for the growth and development of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast tumors.  Aromatase inhibitors (eg, anastrozole, letrozole, exemestane) decrease the synthesis of estrogen from androgens, suppressing estrogen levels and slowing progression of ER-positive tumors.  "

  "explanation_2": "This patient has a sore throat, fever, and pharyngeal ulcers.  Although this constellation of symptoms often occurs as a consequence of viral upper respiratory tract infection, the recent initiation of antithyroid medication for #Graves disease# should raise strong suspicion for #drug-induced neutropenia#. $Patients with Graves disease are often treated initially with thionamide medications such as #methimazole# or #propylthiouracil# (PTU) to achieve a euthyroid state prior to radioiodine therapy or surgery.  However, these medications cause #severe neutropenia# (absolute neutrophil count <500/mm3) in approximately 1 in 200 individuals.  This side effect of therapy is thought to occur due to the interaction of the thionamide with reactive oxidative products (eg, myeloperoxidase, hydrogen peroxide), leading to generation of drug metabolites (eg, propyl thioester, sulfonic acid) that covalently attach to the neutrophil surface.  Antibodies then form against these new antigens (haptens), resulting in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. $Drug-induced neutropenia most often presents with #oropharyngeal ulcers# and #fever# (ie, mucus membrane infection).  Laboratory evaluation usually shows isolated leukopenia (eg, no anemia or thrombocytopenia).  Because patients with drug-induced neutropenia are at risk for #severe infections#, the offending drug should be immediately #discontinued#.  This usually resolves the neutropenia within 1-3 weeks. $#(Choice A)#  Patients with autoimmune thyroid disease (eg, Graves disease) are at risk for other autoimmune endocrinopathies, including adrenal insufficiency.  However, acute adrenal insufficiency typically presents with refractory hypotension, vomiting, abdominal pain, and weakness.  Pharyngitis would be atypical. $#(Choice C)#  Excessive suppression of thyroid function by antithyroid drugs can lead to a hypothyroid state, which can present with fatigue.  However, patients with hypothyroidism demonstrate weight gain, not weight loss; other symptoms (eg, cold intolerance, hair and skin changes) are also usually present. $#(Choice D)#  Undertreatment of this patient's hyperthyroidism could result in a residual hyperthyroid state (ie, thyroid hormone–induced severe hypermetabolism), which can present with fever, tachycardia, and dehydration.  However, hypertension and tremor would likely be present; pharyngeal infection is unexpected. $#(Choice E)#  Several viral infections (eg, HIV) can cause virus-induced lymphocyte destruction.  Although the loss of lymphocytes from viral infection can lead to pharyngeal infection, the presence of fever and pharyngitis shortly after initiation of antithyroid medication is more suggestive of drug-induced neutropenia. $#Educational objective# Drug-induced neutropenia is the major side effect of the first-line medications used to treat Graves disease.  Initial manifestations usually include fever and oropharyngeal ulcers.  "

Metoclopramide, a dopamine 2 receptor antagonist, can improve symptoms but is occasionally associated with extrapyramidal side effects (eg, dystonia) and tardive dyskinesia (eg, involuntary movements). $For patients with gastroparesis who cannot tolerate metoclopramide, #erythromycin#, a macrolide antibiotic, can be used as an alternate prokinetic agent.  The prokinetic effects of erythromycin stem from the #activation of the motilin receptor# in the smooth muscle of the upper digestive tract, which results in coordinated peristaltic contractions that begin in the stomach and move through the entire upper digestive system (thereby propelling food into the colon). $When used as an antibiotic, erythromycin can cause significant abdominal cramping, but in the setting of gastroparesis, the prokinetic effects can be leveraged to improve gastric emptying and ameliorate gastroparesis symptoms.  However, the agonist effects of erythromycin diminish over time# #(tachyphylaxis) so it is generally used for short periods (<4 weeks). $#(Choices B and C)#  Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) who have significant gastrointestinal bloating symptoms can be treated with antispasmodic medications (eg, dicycloverine) that block gastrointestinal muscarinic receptors.  Those with constipation-predominant IBS are sometimes treated with lubiprostone, a chloride channel activator, to increase intestinal fluid secretion.  IBS is usually marked by periods of diarrhea and/or constipation and abdominal bloating; early satiety and vomiting of undigested food would be atypical. $#(Choice D)#  Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is treated with medications (eg, proton pump inhibitor, sucralfate) that have a protective effect on the gastrointestinal mucosa.  Although PUD can occasionally cause nausea, vomiting, and early satiety due to gastric outlet obstruction, most patients have significant upper abdominal pain.  In addition, an EGD would show a gastric or duodenal ulcer. $#(Choice E)#  Patients with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)—colonization of the small intestine with colonic bacteria—often develop bloating, abdominal discomfort, flatulence, and/or diarrhea.  However, early satiety and vomiting of undigested food would be atypical.  In addition, SIBO is generally treated with rifaximin or neomycin. $#Educational objective# Erythromycin stimulates upper gastrointestinal motility by acting as an agonist on motilin receptors in the muscularis externa.  Therefore, it can be used to treat gastroparesis (ie, delayed gastric emptying), a condition that frequently occurs in patients with long standing diabetes mellitus. "

Unlike physiologic basal insulin secretions, NPH has a significant peak effect that increases the risk for hypoglycemia.  In addition, premixing with regular insulin does not easily allow for premeal bolus adjustments.  Therefore, a combined formulation of NPH and regular insulin (usually in a 70/30 ratio) is less representative of physiologic insulin secretion compared to separate injections of basal and rapid-acting premeal insulin. $#Educational objective# Physiologic insulin secretion can be approximated by separate administrations of long-acting and rapid-acting insulin analogues.

  "explanation_2": "$@Cholesterol-lowering agents@ commonly work in 1 of 3 ways: $• Decreasing hepatic cholesterol synthesis $• Decreasing intestinal cholesterol absorption $• Altering cholesterol transport between the blood and tissues $#Ezetimibe# decreases #intestinal absorption# of cholesterol by inhibiting the Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) transporter protein, which transports dietary cholesterol from the gastrointestinal lumen into intestinal enterocytes.  As a result, the total amount of dietary cholesterol reaching the liver decreases, lowering intrahepatocyte cholesterol levels.  To compensate, the liver increases LDL receptor expression, which draws cholesterol out of the circulation. $#(Choice A)#  Bile acid sequestrants (eg, colesevelam) bind bile salts in the intestine, decreasing their reabsorption.  Subsequent depletion of the bile acid pool causes upregulation of cholesterol 7-α-hydroxylase, which converts cholesterol into bile acids. $#(Choice C)#  Fibrates activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha transcription factors, which leads to stimulation of lipoprotein lipase activity and a decrease in triglyceride levels. $#(Choice D)#  Nicotinic acid inhibits hepatic triglyceride synthesis, which in turn reduces the liver's availability to synthesize VLDL particles that are subsequently metabolized into LDL in the circulation. $#(Choice E)#  Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 (PCSK9) increases degradation of hepatic LDL receptors.  Alirocumab is a monoclonal antibody against PCSK9 that blocks this effect, resulting in increased availability of LDL receptors on hepatocyte membranes and subsequently increased clearance of LDL from the blood. $#Educational objective# Ezetimibe reduces intestinal absorption of cholesterol.  As a result, the amount of dietary cholesterol reaching the liver decreases.  To compensate, the liver increases LDL receptor expression, which draws cholesterol out of the circulation.  ",

Although hypoglycemia can occur with any sulfonylurea medication, the risk is highest with longer-acting sulfonylureas (eg, glyburide). $#(Choice A)#  Metformin inhibits the mitochondrial enzymes required for gluconeogenesis, leading to decreased hepatic glucose production and lower circulating glucose levels.  It also increases peripheral glucose uptake and improves insulin sensitivity by activating AMP-activated protein kinase.  Metformin does not increase endogenous insulin secretion and therefore is not associated with hypoglycemia. $#(Choice B)#  Thiazolidinediones (eg, pioglitazone) decrease insulin resistance by binding to peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor gamma, a transcriptional regulator of genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism. $#(Choice D)#  Glucagon-like polypeptide-1 (GLP-1) is secreted by the intestine in response to food intake and slows gastric emptying and increases glucose-dependent insulin release.  GLP-1 agonists (eg, exenatide) act through cell surface receptors that are coupled with a G protein–adenylyl cyclase system.  Because the effects of GLP-1 agonists are glucose dependent (eg, occur primarily in the presence of food), these medications are not typically associated with hypoglycemia. $#(Choice E)#  Insulin acts by binding to a cell surface receptor consisting of 2 alpha and 2 beta subunits.  The alpha subunits are located extracellularly and provide binding sites for insulin.  The membrane-spanning beta subunits contain the intracellular tyrosine kinase domains. $#Educational objective# Sulfonylureas inhibit the ATP-sensitive potassium channel on the pancreatic beta cell membrane, inducing depolarization Ca2+ influx, and insulin release independent of blood glucose concentrations.  Sulfonylureas can induce hypoglycemia because they stimulate insulin secretion even when blood glucose levels are normal.  "

Drugs with high intrinsic hepatic clearance tend to have high lipophilicity and a high volume of distribution.  Highly lipophilic drugs tend to be poorly eliminated in the kidney as these agents rapidly cross tubular cell membranes after filtration to reenter the tissues. $High lipophilicity (lipid solubility) allows the drug to cross cellular barriers more easily and enter hepatocytes.  It can then be excreted in the bile or through other methods of elimination.  In addition, high lipid solubility assures a wide distribution to many different tissues including the brain, liver, and adipose tissue. $#(Choice A)# Drugs with a low distribution volume tend to be confined to the bloodstream and tend not to diffuse readily through hepatocytes into the bile.  Thus, a drug with a low Vd will be highly plasma protein-bound and hydrophilic, making it less available for hepatic metabolism and more readily available for excretion unchanged in the urine. $#(Choice B)# A drug that is not well absorbed orally may have a high pre-systemic (first-pass) elimination or be poorly lipid-soluble.  In both cases, it will be unavailable to the liver for hepatic clearance. $#(Choice D)# A low rate of redistribution from one compartment to another implies low lipid solubility or significant hydrophilicity.

  "explanation_2": "This patient has rhinitis medicamentosa due to the use of a nasal decongestant spray containing an #alpha-adrenergic agonist# (eg, oxymetazoline).  Intranasal application of alpha agonists induces vasoconstriction of superficial blood vessels in the nasal mucosa, reducing rhinorrhea and congestion.  Although these agents are highly effective for symptom control, use for more than a few days is associated with #rebound rhinitis# and dosage escalation due to #tachyphylaxis#. $Tolerance to alpha-adrenergic decongestants develops quickly due to #receptor internalization#.  Both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors undergo a conformational change on ligand binding, allowing them to activate heterotrimeric G proteins involved in signal transduction.  However, the change in conformation also results in the binding of #arrestin#, a protein that prevents further G protein activation and links the receptor complex to clathrin, facilitating receptor endocytosis and depletion from the cell surface. $As alpha-adrenergic receptors become increasingly scarce along the blood vessels of the nasal mucosa, the release of endogenous catecholamines is no longer sufficient to provide adequate vasoconstrictive stimulation.  The resulting congestion/rhinorrhea can be relieved only with #increasing doses# of exogenous alpha agonists.  Treatment involves #cessation# of the culprit decongestant, sometimes with use of intranasal corticosteroids to relieve severe symptoms. $#(Choice A)#  Accelerated drug metabolism can lead to tolerance when a substance induces the enzymes responsible for its degradation (ie, cytochromes P450).  This mechanism is responsible for the tolerance seen with ethanol and barbiturates. $#(Choice B)#  Decreased receptor affinity due to intracellular domain modification (eg, phosphorylation) can play a role in receptor desensitization.  However, desensitization of adrenergic receptors is better explained by the decoupling of G proteins (which are blocked by arrestins) and subsequent receptor internalization. $#(Choice C)#  Tolerance to adrenergic agonists develops due to the binding of arrestins to stimulated adrenergic receptors, preventing G proteins from interacting with the receptor.  G proteins themselves do not become depleted during this process. $#(Choice E)#  Parasympathetic stimulation of the nasal mucosa causes vasodilation, increases plasma extravasation, and stimulates glandular mucous secretion.  Patients with rhinitis medicamentosa have increased parasympathetic tone (physiologic antagonism) that contributes to the congestion/rhinorrhea. $#Educational objective# Activation of adrenergic receptors results in arrestin binding and receptor internalization.

  "explanation_2": "Antagonists are agents that bind to but do not activate receptors.  Antagonists can be either competitive or noncompetitive.  Competitive antagonists bind to the exact same receptor binding sites as endogenous or exogenous agonists, thereby preventing agonist binding and activation of the receptor.  Competitive antagonism can be reversible (ionic bond) or irreversible (covalent bond).  The effect of a reversible competitive antagonist can be overcome by high concentrations of agonist, which cause displacement of the antagonist from the receptors by mass action. $Noncompetitive antagonists, on the other hand, bind to receptors at a site other than the primary agonist binding site, thereby causing a conformational (allosteric) change in the receptor protein that modifies the agonist binding site and prevents agonist binding.  By binding to a different site than the agonist, noncompetitive antagonists are able to remain bound to the receptor even when high concentrations of agonist are present because the agonist is unable to displace noncompetitive antagonists from the receptor.  $The question has asked how the curve for bethanechol #(Curve A)# would be affected by the introduction of a reversible competitive antagonist.  A reversible competitive antagonist is expected to require higher doses of the full agonist (bethanechol) to be present to achieve the same effect at each point along the curve.  If enough of the original substrate is added, the reaction can still reach the same maximum effect.  Thus, the log dose-response curve for a full agonist combined with a reversible competitive antagonist will exhibit a parallel shift to the right in the log-dose response curve, with an increase in the ED₅₀ and no change in the maximum effect (𝐄max). $#(Choice A)# Curve A is the dose-response curve for the original agonist drug in the absence of modifiers such as antagonists. $#(Choices B and C)# Both Curves B and C represent the effect of adding a noncompetitive antagonist to the agonist.  Note that the ED₅₀ is unchanged (i.e. the ED₅₀ for Curves A, B and C occur at the exact same log drug concentration).  This is a distinguishing characteristic of noncompetitive antagonism.  The maximum effect (𝐄max) of Curves B and C are reduced because the noncompetitive antagonist has effectively reduced the number of receptors available for binding.  The decrease in 𝐄max will depend on the dose of noncompetitive antagonist present and is illustrated by the difference between Curves B and C, where a higher concentration of antagonist is present in Curve C than in Curve B. $#(Choice D)# Curve D illustrates a rightward shift in the dose-response relationship, but the shift is not a parallel shift because the shape of the curve differs from that of Curve A, with changes in both 𝐄max and ED₅₀.  This curve is not characteristic of any single antagonist effect and may be the result of adding multiple types of antagonists. $#Educational objective# The changes in the log dose-response curve expected for the effect of a reversible competitive antagonist added to a full agonist are: 1) a parallel shift to the right in the log-dose response curve, illustrating an increase in the ED₅₀, and 2) no change in the maximum effect (𝐄max).  $* Competitive=change ED₅₀=shift right; noncompetitive=change 𝐄max=shift down.

  "explanation_2": "$The #half-life 𝐭₁⁄₂# is the time required for the plasma concentration of a drug with @first-order@ elimination kinetics to decrease by 50%.  At time zero, 100% of the drug is present, and with the passage of each @subsequent half-life@, half of the remaining drug is eliminated.  After 5 half-life intervals, a drug is almost completely eliminated from the body.  A drug's half-life depends on 2 pharmacokinetic properties: $• #Clearance (CL)# represents the volume of plasma completely cleared of a substance per unit time (eg, mL/min).  The CL rate is constant for most drugs and depends on the particular metabolic conversion (eg, glucuronidation to inactive form) and/or elimination pathways (eg, biliary or urinary excretion) used to remove the drug from the body.  Increased glucuronidation or glomerular filtration would increase plasma CL of the drug, leading to decreased drug half-life #(choices A and B)#. $• #Volume of distribution (Vd)# refers to the extent to which a drug distributes in body tissue compared to its plasma concentration.  A drug's Vd is determined by its intrinsic properties (eg, lipid solubility, protein binding), as well as patient factors such as body weight and composition (eg, increased fat vs lean mass).  In general, a #higher Vd# means that the drug is increasingly bound to body tissues with a smaller proportion found in the plasma.  Because #plasma concentrations are lower# for any given dose, drugs with higher Vd take longer to eliminate from the body and therefore have a #longer half-life#. $The half-life of a drug can be @calculated@ using these parameters, as follows: $#\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003𝐭₁⁄₂ = (0.7 × 𝐕d) / 𝐂𝐋# $In this case, the increased drug half-life seen in certain patients is likely due to #increased total body weight#, resulting in a higher volume of distribution. $#(Choices C and D)#  Oral bioavailability can vary between individuals due to intrinsic differences (eg, age, sex, disease), diet, and medications (eg, proton pump inhibitors).  Although increased oral bioavailability can raise peak serum drug levels, drug half-life would not be affected because the amount of drug eliminated per unit time increases as the drug's plasma concentration increases (true of drugs exhibiting first-order kinetics, which account for the vast majority of all clinically used drugs). $#Educational objective# Half-life (𝐭₁⁄₂) is a measure of how quickly a drug with first-order kinetics is eliminated from the body.  A drug is almost completely eliminated after 5 half-life intervals.  The half-life can be calculated from the drug's volume of distribution (𝐕d) and clearance rate (𝐂𝐋) using the following equation: $\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003𝐭₁⁄₂ = (0.7 × 𝐕d) / 𝐂𝐋.  ",

This allows refluxing gastric acid to cause mucosal erosion and ulceration.  Bisphosphonates are contraindicated in conditions that impair esophageal motility (eg, stricture, achalasia).  When bisphosphonates are used, the risk of esophagitis can be lessened by taking the medication with a full glass of water (to ensure the pill is delivered fully into the stomach) and remaining upright for 30 minutes following administration (to avoid reflux of gastric contents). $Bisphosphonates are also associated with #osteonecrosis of the jaw# (mandible or maxilla) and atypical bone fractures (eg, stress fractures of the subtrochanteric zone and femoral shaft).  The precise pathophysiology is debated and may vary, but proposed mechanisms include suppression of bone remodeling, impaired healing of microfractures, and decreased angiogenesis. $#(Choice A)#  Medication-induced nephropathy can be due to interstitial nephritis (eg, cyclosporine), crystal nephropathy (eg, acyclovir), renal vasoconstriction (eg, amphotericin B, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), or tubular injury (eg, aminoglycosides).  Bisphosphonates are eliminated by the kidney and should be used with caution in patients with chronic kidney disease, but do not have substantial nephrotoxicity. $#(Choice B)#  Bisphosphonates decrease bone resorption, thus lowering serum calcium levels.  They are sometimes used in the treatment of severe hypercalcemia (eg, hypercalcemia of malignancy). $#(Choice D)#  Venous thromboembolism is a recognized complication of selective estrogen receptor modulators (eg, raloxifene), but these medications do not often cause esophagitis.  Bisphosphonates do not appreciably increase the risk of thromboembolism. $#(Choice E)#  Vitamin B12 deficiency can be seen in long-term proton pump inhibitor (eg, omeprazole) therapy, possibly due to decreased acid-dependent cleavage of vitamin B12 from dietary proteins.  Although proton pump inhibitors may be taken by patients with bisphosphonate-induced esophagitis, bisphosphonates do not affect vitamin B12 metabolism. $#Educational objective# Medication-induced esophagitis is a common adverse effect of bisphosphonates.

Because average serum levels are relatively equal between the 2 groups, it is likely that the adjuvant improves the efficacy of Drug X by increasing its ability to penetrate the #blood-brain barrier# (BBB). $Many drugs have a difficult time crossing the BBB due to the presence of specialized endothelial cells with very #tight intercellular junctions# that form a #physical barrier# separating the CNS from the circulation.

P-glycoprotein is an ATP-driven #efflux pump# that actively #removes a wide range of substrates# from cells, including many commonly prescribed drugs (eg, antibiotics, immunosuppressant agents, HIV protease inhibitors). $In HIV infection, poor penetration of antiretroviral medications allows the brain to act as an anatomical sanctuary where viral replication can proceed unchecked, facilitating the development of resistant strains.  Methods of bypassing the BBB (eg, disruption of tight junctions, #p-glycoprotein inhibition#) can #improve drug delivery# to the CNS.  P-glycoprotein transporters are also found on the apical surface of enterocytes and can limit drug bioavailability by pumping the drug back into the intestinal lumen.

  "explanation_2": "This patient is likely taking a #first-generation antihistamine# (eg, diphenhydramine), which are commonly used for treating environmental allergies and mast cell-related disorders.  First-generation antihistamines are nonspecific and act as #antagonists# to multiple receptors, including the #muscarinic acetylcholine receptor#.  This leads to #anticholinergic# effects (eg, fever, urinary retention, decreased sweating, altered mental status).  In this patient, the flushing is likely a compensatory response to dissipate excess body heat due to decreased sweating, and the pupillary dilation is due to inhibition of the iris sphincter. $Although commonly described as H1 receptor antagonists, antihistamines are actually inverse agonists that stabilize the receptor in the inactive state.  H1 receptors are found in the vascular endothelium and bronchial smooth muscle, where they mediate vascular permeability and bronchoconstriction, as well as in the central nervous system where they are involved in alertness.  Antihistaminic effects relieve nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing, and itching.  First-generation antihistamines cross the blood-brain barrier and cause sedation.  By contrast, second-generation antihistamines (eg, loratadine) are more specific to the histamine H1 receptor and have less permeability through the blood-brain barrier; they are generally less effective than first-generation antihistamines but have significantly fewer side effects. $#(Choice A)#  Flushing and mydriasis are due to antagonism of the cholinergic receptor, not the H1 receptor. $#(Choice B)#  H2 receptors are found on parietal cells in the gastric mucosa.  H2 antagonists block gastric acid secretion by parietal cells. $#(Choice D)#  Nicotinic cholinergic receptors are found in sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia and on skeletal muscle cells at the neuromuscular junction.  Nicotinic receptor antagonists (eg, rocuronium) are used to induce paralysis in preparation for surgery or endotracheal intubation.  Adverse effects include hemodynamic instability (eg, hypotension) and respiratory insufficiency. $#(Choice E)#  Alpha-1 adrenoreceptors are located on smooth muscle and neurons.  Activation of these receptors increases smooth muscle tone of the iris dilator (causing mydriasis) and blood vessels (causing vasoconstriction); alpha-1 adrenergic agonists (eg, phenylephrine, oxymetazoline) can be used in patients with allergic rhinitis because their vasoconstrictive action reduces nasal congestion.  However, vasoconstriction inhibits flushing. $#Educational objective# First-generation antihistamines are nonspecific and interact with multiple receptors, including the muscarinic receptor.  This leads to anticholinergic effects (eg, fever, flushing, mydriasis, urinary retention, tachycardia, altered mental status).  "

  "explanation_2": "The volume of distribution (Vd) refers to a hypothetical volume of fluid into which the administered amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the observed plasma concentration.  The volume of distribution is determined by administering a given amount of drug by the intravenous route and subsequently measuring the initial plasma concentration of the drug.  The formula is as follows: $#\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003Vd (L) = amount of drug given (mg) / plasma concentration of drug (mg/L)# $The average total body water is approximately 41 liters.  Of that, the extracellular fluid volume is about 14 L, or 1/3 of total body water.  Within the extracellular fluid, the plasma volume is about 3 L, and interstitial fluid makes up the rest.  Initially, the drug enters the plasma compartment by the IV route.  If a drug has a large molecular weight, is bound extensively to plasma proteins, or is highly charged (hydrophilic), then the drug generally remains in the plasma compartment and the volume of distribution is usually low as in the case above (about 3-5 liters).  If the drug has a small molecular weight but is hydrophilic, it can distribute into the interstitial fluid compartment outside of the blood vessels as well as in the intravascular compartment.  In these cases the volume of distribution is limited to a total volume of about 14-16 liters (plasma volume plus interstitial volume).  If the drug has a small molecular weight and is also uncharged (hydrophobic or lipophilic), then the drug can cross cell membranes and reach intracellular compartment.  These drugs have the highest volume of distribution (41 liters).  Drugs that are avidly bound in the tissues exhibit the highest volumes of distribution, often much higher than the total body water volume, because these drugs accumulate readily within cells thereby maintaining low plasma concentrations. $#(Choice A)# If the molecular weight of the drug is low, then the drug will tend to easily pass through endothelial junctions into the interstitial fluid, making the volume of distribution at least 14 liters.  The Vd may be higher if the drug is also hydrophobic. $#(Choice B)# Lipophilic drugs tend to readily cross cell membranes and distribute widely outside the plasma and interstitial compartments.  This tendency to collect within cells gives these drugs a high volume of distribution. $#(Choice C)# A drug with a Vd of 4.5 L, which is approximately the same as the plasma volume, is likely to be highly bound to plasma proteins such as albumin.  Binding to plasma proteins tends to retain drug in the plasma compartment and prevent the diffusion of drug into the extravascular compartments.  If this drug were not bound to albumin, it would be more likely to diffuse into the interstitium and a higher Vd would be expected. $#(Choice E)# Bioavailability is a measure of absorption and is unrelated to the distribution of a drug. $#Educational objective# Characteristics of a drug such as high molecular weight, high plasma protein binding, high charge, and hydrophilicity tend to trap the drug in the plasma compartment resulting in a low Vd (3-5 L).

These slight interpersonal variations in the ability to metabolize drugs are typically reflected graphically by a unimodal distribution, usually in the shape of a bell curve, when plasma levels of drug are measured at a fixed time following a fixed dose of drug.  This is the method that was used to generate the graph given in the question stem.  With most drugs, the majority of people fall within one standard deviation and 95% of people fall within two standard deviations of the population mean of plasma concentration.  A single peak in this type of graph indicates that the population being tested possesses a similar genetic drug metabolizing capacity. $A bimodal (discontinuous, polymorphic) curve, as shown in the question stem, results from the presence of two apparently distinct groups within the study population and suggests a pharmacogenetic polymorphism in drug metabolizing capacity.  In other words, the two peaks indicate two sets of responders to the drug within the population: one that rapidly converts the drug into its metabolite (considered normals) and another that converts the drug slowly, leading to accumulation of the original drug in the plasma. $Isoniazid is metabolized by acetylation to N-acetyl-isoniazid in the hepatic microsomal system by the enzyme N-acetyl transferase and is subsequently excreted in the urine.  The first and second peaks in the above graph represent fast and slow acetylators, respectively.  Slow acetylators of isoniazid also metabolize (acetylate) dapsone, hydralazine, and procainamide slowly, causing accumulation of these drugs as well.  Slow acetylators of these drugs are at increased risk of toxic effects, while fast acetylators may require much higher therapeutic doses to achieve a therapeutic effect. $#(Choice A)# Methylation is an important drug biotransformation method to consider when prescribing drugs such as azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine, drugs used in the treatment of some inflammatory disorders of the bowel and skin. $#(Choice B)# Glucuronidation is a biotransformation pathway utilized for the metabolism of numerous drugs as well as endogenous substances such as bilirubin.  No bimodality has been described with this pathway, but conditions such as Gilbert syndrome involve dysfunction of the glucuronyl transferase system that can lead to toxic accumulation of some drugs. $#(Choice C)# Hydrolysis occurs with enzymes such as esterases and amidases.  Isoniazid is not metabolized by this pathway, and hydrolysis does not exhibit polymorphic metabolism. $#(Choice E)# Amine oxidation is usually undertaken by monoamine oxidases or by cytochrome oxidative deamination.  Neither process metabolizes isoniazid nor exhibits bimodality. $#Educational objective #Isoniazid is metabolized by acetylation.  The speed with which a patient is able to acetylate drugs depends on whether they are genetically \"fast\" or \"slow\" acetylators.  The presence of fast and slow acetylators within the same population results in a bimodal distribution of the speed of isoniazid metabolism.  Slow acetylators are at increased risk of adverse side effects.  "

This can result in higher serum drug levels and a prolonged elimination phase, which can be particularly important for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index (eg, digoxin, antiarrhythmics). $In this example, #serum metformin levels# are seen to #increase# in animals with experimentally induced heart failure.  Because metformin is #renally cleared#, this effect is most likely due to #decreased renal blood flow# as a result of reduced cardiac output.  Because of the risk of lactic acidosis, metformin should be used with caution in patients with heart failure or impaired renal function from other causes. $#(Choices A and D)#  Heart failure frequently causes high central venous pressure and hepatic congestion.  The resulting impairment in nutrient and oxygen delivery leads to hepatocellular damage and downregulation of CYP enzymes involved in drug metabolism.  Reduced hepatic blood flow also results in decreased drug delivery to the liver, further impairing hepatic drug metabolism and clearance.  However, metformin is not metabolized by the liver; it is excreted unchanged by the kidney. $#(Choice C)#  Decreased tissue perfusion in heart failure typically leads to a reduced volume of distribution of most drugs.  Although the extracellular fluid accumulation that occurs in decompensated heart failure can potentially increase the volume of distribution of water-soluble drugs, this increased distribution volume would result in a decrease in serum drug levels. $#(Choice E)#  Increased central venous pressure in heart failure can lead to intestinal wall edema with increased intestinal wall thickness.  This can result in delayed or decreased intestinal drug absorption.  However, this effect would be expected to cause reduced serum drug concentrations and delayed peak levels. $#Educational objective# Heart failure leads to reduced liver and kidney perfusion, resulting in reduced drug clearance.  Metformin is excreted unchanged by the kidney; therefore, patients with significant renal insufficiency due to heart failure or other causes (eg, chronic kidney disease) are at increased risk of toxicity (eg, lactic acidosis).

  "explanation_2": "$Bioavailability is the fraction of an administered drug that reaches the systemic circulation unchanged.  #Oral bioavailability# depends on the drug's intrinsic ability to be absorbed by the gastrointestinal mucosa (eg, poor with vancomycin) and its propensity for metabolization by intestinal and #hepatic enzymes# (first-pass metabolism). $When a drug has high #first-pass metabolism#, large amounts of its metabolites (rather than the drug itself) enter the systemic circulation.  Drugs that are largely inactivated by first-pass metabolism (ie, low oral bioavailability) are often administered by a route that bypasses the portal circulation (eg, intravenous, sublingual). $#Rectal administration# (via suppository) allows a drug to #partially escape# first-pass metabolism.  Venous drainage of the anorectum above the dentate line is to the portal venous system via the superior rectal veins (which drain to the inferior mesenteric vein).  However, the region #below the dentate line# drains into the systemic circulation via the middle and inferior rectal veins (which drain to the internal iliac and internal pudendal veins, respectively).  For a drug that is inactivated by first-pass metabolism, the rectal route allows a higher proportion of the drug to bypass portal circulation, increasing bioavailability. $#(Choices B, C, and D)#  For orally administered drugs, the small intestine is a major site of absorption owing to its large surface area and high blood flow rates.  In contrast, the rectum has a much smaller surface area, lower blood flow rates, and often contains absorptive stool.  Therefore, rectally administered drugs are typically absorbed more slowly and erratically compared to orally administered drugs. $#(Choice E)#  Reduced renal blood flow causes a decrease in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which in turn slows elimination of renally excreted drugs (ie, increases bioavailability).  Patients with reduced GFR may require a lower dose to prevent adverse effects.  However, the route of administration does not impact drug clearance. $#Educational objective# Drugs administered orally must pass through the portal circulation and are subject to first-pass metabolism by intestinal and hepatic enzymes.  Rectal administration is capable of partially bypassing first-pass metabolism due to the portion of venous outflow that goes directly to the systemic circulation; drugs with extensive first-pass metabolism have increased bioavailability when administered rectally.

  "explanation_2": "Efficacy and potency are terms that are commonly used and often confused.  In pharmacology, efficacy refers to the intrinsic ability of a drug to elicit an effect, such as receptor activation or dilation of a vessel as described in the question stem.  It is a measure of the maximum ceiling of activity [𝐄max]  of a drug with respect to a particular pharmacodynamic end point.  For example, loop diuretics such as furosemide or bumetanide will cause greater diuresis or natriuresis than any thiazide diuretic, irrespective of dose. $Potency, on the other hand, refers to the dose of drug that is required to produce a given effect.  The potency of a drug is primarily affected by the affinity of the drug for its receptor and the amount of drug that is able to reach the target tissues   Therefore, drugs that bind their receptors with a higher affinity or are better able to gain access to their target tissues will have greater potency.  The potency of different agents can be compared by determining the dose of drug that is required to produce one-half (50%) of the maximum biological response.  This dose is known as the ED₅₀.  The lower the ED₅₀ of a drug, the more potent it is.  For example, among the thiazide diuretics, 25mg of hydrochlorothiazide and 5mg chlorthalidone produce similar drops in blood pressure (similar efficacy), but chlorthalidone requires a lower dose, or lower ED₅₀, than HCTZ to cause a similar effect (higher potency). $With respect to the question, drug 2 and drug 3 have similar maximum effects (efficacy).  A much lower dose of drug 2 is required to produce the same effect as that seen with drug 3; therefore, drug 2 is more potent than drug 3 and has a lower ED₅₀.  To achieve this higher potency, the binding of drug 2 to its receptors (affinity) must be higher than that of drug 3 #(choice B),# or drug 2 must be better able to reach its target (penetration) than drug 3. $#(Choice A)# Drug 1 has higher potency than Drug 2 because at low biological activity, it can cause the same effect with much lower concentrations of drug.  However, it does not reach the same maximum effect as Drug 2. $#(Choice C)# Drug 1 demonstrates the lowest efficacy (ceiling of biological effect) of the three drugs graphed.  Lower efficacy may be a result of partial agonism and other factors.  $#(Choice D)# Drugs 2 and 3 exhibit a parallel shift in their relative biological effects exhibiting similar efficacy but different potency (The shapes of their graphs are identical, but at different dose ranges).  Drug 3 may contain the same basic pharmocologic agent as Drug 2 but with a competitive antagonist mixed in; thus, the 𝐄max is the same but the ED₅₀ is higher.  A competitive antagonist would bind to the same location as the original substance. $#(Choice E)# Drug 2 has a lower ED₅₀ (greater potency) than drug 3.  Both have equal efficacy. $#Educational objective #Efficacy is a measure of the maximum pharmacodynamic effect achievable with a drug.  Potency refers to the dose of drug that is required to produce a given effect.  Drugs that bind their receptors with a higher affinity or are better able to gain access to their target tissues will have greater potency (lower ED₅₀).  "

  "explanation_2": "This patient has muscle tenderness and weakness.  The dark urine suggests #myoglobinuria #due to myocyte necrosis.  In the context of ongoing statin therapy for hyperlipidemia, this presentation likely represents statin myopathy.  Statin myopathy is due, likely at least in part, to decreased myocyte production of coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinone).  Serum muscle breakdown markers (eg, creatine kinase) are often elevated, and severe cases may lead to #rhabdomyolysis #with subsequent #acute kidney injury# (eg, elevated BUN and creatinine). $#Statin myopathy# is most common in the initial weeks or months of therapy.  However, it can occasionally occur later, and can be acutely triggered by medications that increase circulating statin levels.  This patient's myopathy is most likely related to the initiation of clarithromycin as part of a multidrug regimen for Helicobacter pylori. $Statins, primarily simvastatin, lovastatin, and atorvastatin, are metabolized by #CYP3A4#.  This enzyme can be #inhibited by macrolide antibiotics# (eg, erythromycin, clarithromycin), leading to increased statin drug levels and subsequent statin myopathy.  (Azithromycin does not significantly inhibit CYP3A4.)  Other significant CYP3A4 inhibitors that can induce statin myopathy include ketoconazole, non–dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, diltiazem), amiodarone, and protease inhibitors (eg, ritonavir).  Because pravastatin is not primarily metabolized by CYP3A4, patients who must take a CYP3A4 inhibitor may benefit from switching to this drug. $#(Choice A)#  Amoxicillin does not inhibit CYP3A4 or increase circulating simvastatin levels.  Penicillin antibiotics generally have only minor effects on the cytochrome P-450 system. $#(Choice B)#  Bismuth subsalicylate can cause black stools due to the formation of bismuth sulfate in the gastrointestinal tract.  However, this medication does not cause myopathy or myoglobinuria.  Excessive intake of bismuth can cause motor weakness, but this is due primarily to neural rather than muscle toxicity. $#(Choice C)#  Polyvalent cations (eg, calcium, iron) can form insoluble chelate complexes with certain antibiotics (eg, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones) and other drugs (eg, levothyroxine, levodopa), leading to decreased drug absorption.  Simvastatin does not form chelate complexes, and decreased absorption would lower, not increase, the risk for myopathy. $#(Choice E)#  Both metronidazole and simvastatin carry a small risk for peripheral neuropathy.  In some patients, the effect can be additive and lead to numbness, pain, and paresthesia in the hands and feet.  However, this neuropathy would not cause muscle tenderness or myoglobinuria. $#Educational objective# Statins, primarily simvastatin, lovastatin, and atorvastatin, are metabolized by CYP3A4.  Drugs that inhibit this enzyme (eg, macrolide antibiotics, ketoconazole, non–dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, amiodarone) can cause increased statin drug levels and lead to statin myopathy.

The graph above shows how the #rate of drug glucuronidation# changes with increasing drug doses.  At lower doses, the quantity of drug-glucuronide formed is directly proportional to the dose administered (ie, as more of the drug is administered, more drug-glucuronide is produced).  Because a #fixed proportion# of drug is converted to the metabolite, this early portion of the graph represents #first-order kinetics#. $As the active sites on glucuronosyltransferase become saturated, the drug-glucuronide rate does not continue to rise with increasing doses of the substrate drug.  At this point (2 on the graph), the kinetics change from first- to #zero-order kinetics# and the graph levels out to a zero slope.  With zero-order kinetics, #a constant amount# of drug is metabolized and eliminated per unit of time regardless of its concentration or dose. $Zero- and first-order kinetics can also be represented graphically by showing the decrease in @drug concentration over time@ after a single dose.  Zero-order metabolism is indicated by a straight line with negative slope (fixed amount eliminated per unit of time), whereas first-order kinetics manifest as an exponential decay curve (fixed proportion eliminated per unit of time). $#(Choice A)#  After point 3, the curve remains flat, indicating that a constant amount of drug is metabolized per unit of time regardless of the dose.  As higher doses are administered, the proportion that is converted to the metabolite becomes smaller (ie, the proportion metabolized is non-constant after point 3). $#(Choice B)#  Bioavailability is the fraction of an administered drug that reaches the systemic circulation unchanged.  It usually decreases with oral administration due to incomplete absorption and first-pass metabolism compared to parenteral administration.  In this case, higher doses of the drug are likely to have greater bioavailability due to the saturation of hepatic metabolism. $#(Choice C)#  At point 2, biotransformation (ie, metabolism) of the drug begins to switch from first-order to zero-order kinetics due to enzyme saturation.  However, drug metabolism does not stop. $#(Choice E)#  Before point 1, drug metabolism proceeds via first-order kinetics.  Therefore, the drug metabolization rate increases as higher doses are administered. $#Educational objective# In first-order kinetics, a constant fraction (or proportion) of drug is metabolized per unit of time, so the amount metabolized changes based on the serum concentration.

  "explanation_2": "$Platinum-based chemotherapy agents (eg, cisplatin) are widely used as a first-line treatment for many solid tumors, including non–small cell lung cancer.  These agents disrupt DNA replication and have substantial cytotoxicity against rapidly proliferating cells.  Despite their efficacy in killing tumor cells, their use is limited by severe adverse effects (eg, nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, myelosuppression) that occur due to accumulation within normal tissues (ie, off-target effects). $Methods that provide #targeted delivery# to the tumor site can help #minimize toxicity# and #optimize drug response#.  In this example, cisplatin is encapsulated in liposomes, forming a nanoparticle cage that traps the drug and limits its interaction with normal cells.  The addition of anti–epidermal growth factor receptor #(anti-EGFR) antibodies# on the liposome surface results in an #antibody-drug conjugate#, allowing the encapsulated drug complex to #selectively bind to tumor cells# expressing high levels of EGFR, which is often overexpressed in non–small cell lung cancer.  Once bound, the antibody-drug complex is internalized and degraded, releasing the free drug into the cytoplasm and causing targeted cell death. $#(Choice A)#  Overexpression of drug efflux pumps (eg, P-glycoprotein) by cancer cells is a major cause of chemotherapy resistance.  Efflux pump inhibitors can decrease drug excretion from tumor cells and potentiate the effects of chemotherapeutic agents. $#(Choice B)#  Many cancers create an immunosuppressive microenvironment that prevents the immune system from effectively killing tumor cells.  An enhanced cytotoxic T-cell response against tumor cells occurs with the use of @immune checkpoint inhibitors@ (eg, PD-1 or CTLA-4 receptor inhibitors) that help prevent T-cell exhaustion. $#(Choice C)#  Desmoplasia (ie, reactive growth of fibrous connective tissue) occurs in response to certain tumors (eg, breast, pancreatic carcinoma).  The dense fibrotic tissue acts as a molecular sieve, decreasing the penetration of chemotherapeutic agents.  Chemoresistance is more likely to occur with larger drug complexes; in this case, the new liposomal formulation will be much larger than individual cisplatin molecules, resulting in decreased desmoplastic penetration. $#(Choice D)#  Increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) within tumors stimulates blood vessel growth, facilitating tumor expansion and increasing the potential for metastasis.  Anti-VEGF antibodies (eg, bevacizumab) bind VEGF and inhibit tumor-induced angiogenesis.  Although EGFR stimulation also plays a role in angiogenesis, in this case, the anti-EGFR antibodies are used for targeting purposes and may not necessarily inhibit the EGFR receptor (antibodies can be stimulatory, inhibitory, or have no signaling effect depending on the attachment site). $#Educational objective# Antibody-drug conjugates improve drug efficacy and minimize toxicity by allowing conventional chemotherapeutic agents (eg, cisplatin) to selectively target and kill cancer cells while sparing healthy cells (ie, targeted delivery).

No new structural explanation for increased pain was revealed on medical evaluation (ie, unchanged spine imaging and physical examination).  Therefore, the loss of opioid analgesic efficacy is likely due to #drug tolerance#: higher doses of drugs are required to achieve the same clinical effect. $A distinction is drawn between pharmacokinetic versus pharmacodynamic tolerance: $• Pharmacokinetic tolerance (ADME):  The plasma level of the active drug is decreased due to impaired #A#bsorption (eg, short bowel syndrome), increased tissue #D#istribution (eg, plasma protein binding, adiposity), increased #M#etabolism (eg, P450 cytochrome induction), or increased #E#xcretion. $• Pharmacodynamic tolerance:  The plasma level of the active drug is unchanged (ie, normal pharmacokinetics).  However, the action of the drug on target cells is blunted (eg, #receptor downregulation#, decreased intracellular signaling), reducing the overall pharmacologic effect. $In both cases, tolerance can be innate or acquired.  Innate tolerance refers to inborn differences in genes coding for enzymes involved in drug metabolism (pharmacokinetic) or receptor structure/expression (pharmacodynamic).  Innate tolerance is apparent from the first dose, which elicits an unexpectedly weak effect.  This patient experienced a good analgesic response initially, arguing against the presence of innate tolerance #(choice A).# $Acquired tolerance is defined as a decreased pharmacologic response following prolonged drug exposure.  #Acquired pharmacodynamic tolerance# is the primary form of chronic opioid tolerance, characterized by downregulation and decreased responsivity (eg, GRK/beta-arrestin phosphorylation) of the mu opioid receptor system compared to the opioid-naïve state. $#(Choice C)#  The kappa and delta opioid receptors bind to endogenous opioid-like neuropeptides (dynorphin and enkephalins, respectively) to mediate analgesia.  Like mu receptors, they are also downregulated by chronic opioid administration, contributing further to acquired pharmacodynamic tolerance. $#(Choice D)#  In acquired pharmacokinetic tolerance, altered ADME results in lower plasma drug levels.  Higher rates of metabolism (eg, P450 enzyme autoinduction) can accelerate the inactivation/elimination of many medications (eg, methadone, carbamazepine).  However, lower rates of excretion (eg, renal or hepatic insufficiency) would raise the plasma drug concentration, leading to potential overdose rather than tolerance. $#(Choice E)#  Adiposity (eg, increasing obesity) can contribute to pharmacokinetic tolerance by raising the apparent volume of distribution, thereby lowering the plasma drug concentration.  However, equilibration between plasma and extravascular compartments is complete within 5 drug half-lives, occurring long before this patient's development of tolerance after 3 months.  Furthermore, adipose partitioning is primarily a concern for highly lipophilic drugs (eg, fentanyl, not oxycodone). $#Educational objective# Chronic opioid therapy leads to the development of acquired pharmacodynamic tolerance via downregulation and decreased responsiveness of opioid receptor systems.

Other commonly used medications that should be avoided in the elderly include benzodiazepines (and other sedating medications), antipsychotics, many antiarrhythmics (eg, digoxin), and centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxants. $#(Choices A and E)#  Although hypotension due to excessive antihypertension medication use could cause dizziness, this patient has normal blood pressure and heart rate, making this much less likely as a cause of her dizziness.  In addition, although centrally acting alpha agonists (eg, clonidine) and alpha-1 blockers (eg, doxazosin) confer a high risk of orthostatic hypotension in elderly patients, thiazide diuretics (eg, hydrochlorothiazide), calcium channel blockers (eg, amlodipine), and ACE inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers are generally considered acceptable for this population. $#(Choice B)#  Aspirin should be used with caution in older adults due to the increased risk of gastric ulcer; however, the reduced risk of cardiovascular events provided by aspirin in patients with prior transient ischemic attack or stroke likely outweighs this risk. $#(Choice D)#  Donepezil is a cholinesterase inhibitor that is commonly used in the treatment of Alzheimer dementia.  Bradycardia can occasionally occur; however, this patient has a normal heart rate. $#(Choice F)#  Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (eg, sertraline) are the preferred first-line medications for depression in older adults.  Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (eg, duloxetine) may also be used, especially for patients with chronic pain.  Tricyclic antidepressants are relatively contraindicated in the elderly due to their anticholinergic effects. $#Educational objective# The Beers criteria identify drugs that should be used with caution in geriatric patients.

Because drug toxicity most often correlates with peak or average plasma drug levels, the #6-hour regimen# is likely to have #lower toxicity#. $#(Choice A)#  Clearance (hepatic or renal) of a substance depends on the intrinsic properties of the agent.  It is defined as the amount of plasma that is cleared of the drug over a given period (eg, mL/min).  Drug clearance is typically the same regardless of the dosing schedule. $#(Choice B)#  Average plasma drug levels are lower when a fixed amount of drug is given in more divided doses.  In this example, 4 grams are administered every 24 hours, either in 2 doses (12-hr regimen) or 4 doses (6-hr regimen).  Therefore, the more frequent 6-hour regimen would result in lower average plasma drug levels. $#(Choice C)#  Patient compliance is increased when the frequency of dosing is minimized.  Only 2 doses per day are needed with the 12-hour regimen; however, the 6-hour regimen needs 4 doses and is likely to be more disruptive to the patient's schedule. $#(Choice E)#  The therapeutic window refers to the range of drug dosages that have an appropriate clinical effect.  It begins at the lowest dose at which the drug is effective and ends at the highest dose without significant toxic effects.  Drugs with a narrow therapeutic window are often dosed more frequently to prevent large swings in plasma concentration. $#Educational objective# Drug dosing regimens with more frequent dosing have lower peak and average drug levels, which can help reduce drug toxicity.

This deficiency leads to the accumulation of glucocerebroside, a glycolipid component of cell membranes, within the lysosomes of macrophages, giving them the classic appearance of wrinkled tissue paper.  Characteristic symptoms (eg, hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, bone pain) develop as lipid-laden macrophages accumulate in the body's tissues (eg, spleen, liver, and bone). $Lysosomal storage diseases can be treated through the delivery of a #replacement enzyme# into the lysosomes of affected cells; in the case of Gaucher disease, #recombinant glucocerebrosidases# (eg, imiglucerase) are available to replace the deficient enzyme.  Almost all human enzymes, including lysosomal enzymes, are large polypeptides (eg, proteins) #(choice B).#  Although the oral route is often preferred for drug administration, most peptide-based drugs (eg, insulin, immunoglobulins) cannot be efficiently absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract due to the intestinal epithelial barrier and extensive proteolysis that takes place in the stomach and duodenum.  As a result, #large polypeptides# such as a glucocerebrosidase must be #administered intravenously# to achieve adequate circulating levels. $Once in the circulation, exogenous glucocerebrosidase can enter cells by binding to #mannose 6-phosphate receptors#.  These receptors are found in the Golgi network, where they help route newly synthesized lysosomal proteins (tagged by mannose 6-phosphate residues).  They are also expressed #on the cell surface#, where they bind free lysosomal enzymes that are accidentally secreted.  Exogenous glucocerebrosidase can bind to these cell surface receptors, inducing #endocytosis# of the bound enzyme.  It is then carried by endosomes to lysosomes, where it can degrade accumulated glucocerebrosides, reducing disease manifestations. $#(Choices C and D)#  Enzymes are large, polar polypeptides that are unable to effectively cross the cell membrane by passive diffusion.  In contrast, steroid-based drugs are typically hydrophobic and can easily cross cell membranes by passive diffusion.  However, steroidal drugs function by binding to receptors; they do not directly catalyze reactions. $#(Choices E, F, G, and H)#  Unlike in lysosomal storage diseases, enzyme replacement therapy for pancreatic exocrine insufficiency is administered orally because pancreatic digestive enzymes normally function within the gastrointestinal lumen. $#Educational objective# Certain lysosomal storage diseases, including Gaucher disease, can be treated with enzyme-replacement therapy (eg, recombinant glucocerebrosidase).  Because enzymes are large proteins that cannot be orally absorbed, the replacement enzyme must be administered intravenously.  Entry into the cell occurs by endocytosis after the replacement enzyme binds to mannose 6-phosphate receptors on the cell surface.  "

Blockade of Na+ and Cl− reabsorption from the tubular lumen decreases the medullary concentration gradient, impairing the kidney's ability to concentrate urine and increasing the overall excretion of Na+, Cl−, and H2O.  Adverse effects of loop diuretics include electrolyte abnormalities (eg, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia) and ototoxicity. $#(Choice A)#  Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (acetazolamide) block the reabsorption of NaCl and NaHCO3 in the proximal tubule.

Cholinergic agonists (eg, bethanechol) are used to treat urinary retention or neurogenic bladder by strengthening muscular contractions.  These medications would worsen this patient's symptoms. $#Educational objective# Urgency incontinence, or overactive bladder, is caused by uninhibited bladder contractions (detrusor instability) that results in a sudden urge to void followed by an involuntary loss of urine.  Treatment with beta-3 adrenergic receptor activation (eg, mirabegron) relaxes the detrusor muscle, promotes urine storage, and decreases incontinent episodes.  "

The apical membrane of early distal tubule cells contains the Na+/Cl- symporter while the basolateral side has Na+/K+ ATPases and Cl- channels that maintain a NaCl gradient across the apical cell membrane.  Thiazides inhibit the apical Na+/Cl- symporter, decreasing luminal NaCl absorption into the distal tubular cell.  This can cause hypercalcemia by reducing intracellular Na+ concentrations, which in turn increases the activity of the basolateral Na+-Ca2+ exchanger.  The resulting reduction in intracellular Ca2+ levels acts to increase luminal Ca2+ absorption in the distal tubule.  Increased Ca2+ absorption in the proximal tubule secondary to volume depletion can also contribute to hypercalcemia in thiazide-treated patients. $There are a number of thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics available.  Examples include hydrochlorothiazide, chlorothiazide, indapamide, and metolazone.  They differ in potency, bioavailability, and half-life.  Thiazides are not as efficacious as loop diuretics as only a small amount of filtered Na reaches the distal tubules.  They are used to treat edema secondary to heart failure, renal disease, and liver disease.  Thiazides are also commonly used to treat hypertension.

This benefit is independent of effects on systemic blood pressure and can also be seen in nonhypertensive patients. $#(Choice A)#  Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, diltiazem, verapamil) decrease proteinuria, but this effect is not seen with dihydropyridine agents (eg, amlodipine, nifedipine).  Although blood pressure control is important in patients with diabetes, lisinopril is more beneficial for preventing progression of nephropathy. $#(Choices B and C)#  Carvedilol is a nonselective beta- and alpha-adrenergic blocker used in hypertension and congestive heart failure.  Eplerenone is a mineralocorticoid (aldosterone) antagonist that is also used in congestive heart failure.  These agents have no specific role in the management of DN. $#(Choice D)#  Hydrochlorothiazide is an effective antihypertensive agent.  However, it also causes hyperglycemia and may be associated with worsened glucose control in diabetic patients.  ACE inhibitors are preferred over thiazides for first-line treatment. $#(Choice E)#  Isosorbide dinitrate is an intermediate-acting nitrate used in the treatment of stable angina pectoris.  It has no role in the management of DN. $#(Choice G)#  Alpha-1 blockers (eg, doxazosin, prazosin, terazosin) are useful for treatment of hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia but are not recommended as monotherapy for hypertension due to an increased risk of cardiovascular events. $#Educational objective# The risk of progression of diabetic nephropathy in patients with proteinuria can be reduced by appropriate glycemic and blood pressure control.  ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers are the preferred antihypertensive agents due to their antiproteinuric effects, which are independent from their effects on systemic blood pressure.

  "explanation_2": "#Loop diuretics# (eg, furosemide) are sometimes abused by patients with eating disorders (eg, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa) in an effort to lose weight.  These drugs #inhibit the Na+-K+-2Cl−# #transporter# in the loop of Henle, resulting in increased urinary excretion of Na+, Cl−, K+, and water.  These changes in electrolyte handling also increase renal H+ excretion, leading to #metabolic alkalosis# (elevated serum HCO3−).  Overuse of loop diuretics leads to massive electrolyte and fluid losses with #intravascular volume depletion# and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.  This secondary hyperaldosteronism stimulates increased Na+ reabsorption in the renal tubular collecting duct, as well as a lesser degree of passive Cl− reabsorption.  The relatively high loss of Cl− that occurs is responsible for a #characteristic hypochloremia#. $Secondary hyperaldosteronism also stimulates increased K+ and H+ excretion in the @collecting duct@, exacerbating the #hypokalemia# and metabolic alkalosis.  The alkalosis is further compounded by an angiotensin II-mediated increase in proximal tubule sodium bicarbonate reabsorption.  #Chloride depletion# then #perpetuates the alkalosis# because low Cl− levels in the tubular lumen impair HCO3− excretion via the pendrin Cl−/HCO3− exchanger on @beta intercalated cells@ in the collecting duct. $The #urine electrolyte# findings in loop diuretic abuse depend on how recently the medication was last ingested.  Within several hours after ingestion (as in this patient with positive urine screening), #increased urine Na+, Cl−, and K+# is expected.  Once the medication effect wears off, urine Na+ and urine Cl- are low as the kidneys attempt to increase blood volume.  Urine K+ is likely to remain increased due to ongoing aldosterone-mediated losses #(choice C).# $#(Choices B, D, and E)#  Because Cl− and HCO3− are the most abundant anions in the body, they are the primary determinants of total body electronegativity.  Therefore, when one of these anions is depleted the kidneys and intestines retain the other to maintain electronegative balance.  This results in a typical inverse relationship between serum Cl− and serum HCO3− levels (when one is low the other tends to be elevated).  The presence of additional anions in the body (eg, anion gap metabolic acidosis) may disrupt this relationship. $#Educational objective# Overuse or abuse of loop diuretics (eg, furosemide) characteristically causes hypokalemic, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis.  Urine electrolyte findings depend on how recently the diuretic was last ingested; increased urine Na+, Cl−, and K+ are expected with recent ingestion.  ",

  "explanation_2": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (typically named \"-pril\") are one of the most important agents in treating hypertension, heart failure, and renal failure with or without proteinuria.  They work by preventing the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II.  This prevents the efferent arteriole from constricting more than the afferent arteriole, thus decreasing the glomerular pressure and glomerular filtration rate (GFR).  It is expected for the GFR to decrease in all patients initially.  Most clinicians are generally not concerned by this unless the creatinine increases by greater than 30% because the long-term benefits of ACE inhibitors are well studied.  Other common side-effects of ACE inhibitors include hyperkalemia and cough. $#(Choice B)#  Metoprolol is a beta-blocker.  Typical side-effects include bradycardia and erectile dysfunction.  Although beta blockers act upon the beta-1 receptors of the juxtaglomerular cells to reduce renin secretion, their use generally does not have a clinically significant effect on the GFR. $#(Choice C)#  Atorvastatin is an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor; worrisome side-effects include muscle toxicity and hepatic dysfunction.  Statins can uncommonly cause rhabdomyolysis, particularly when used in combination with fibrates or cyclosporin.  However, massive rhabdomyolysis leading to acute kidney injury would most likely produce additional signs and symptoms such as myalgias, muscle weakness, dark urine, and elevated creatine kinase. $#(Choices D and E)#  Hydrochlorothiazide is a potassium-wasting thiazide diuretic that may decrease GFR if it results in volume depletion and pre-renal azotemia.  Furosemide is also potassium-wasting loop diuretic. $#(Choice F)#  Metformin itself does not have nephrotoxic side effects.  However, impaired renal function or recent IV contrast administration may reduce metformin excretion, resulting in systemic accumulation and possible lactic acidosis. $#(Choice G)#  Prazosin is an alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist that is used in the treatment of hypertension.  It does not decrease the GFR. $#Educational objective# Common side-effects of ACE-inhibitors include decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR), hyperkalemia, and cough.

  "explanation_2": "$The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is one of the most important neurohormonal systems, regulating arterial blood pressure and sodium and fluid content in the body.  In response to decreased sodium, fluid volume, or arterial blood pressure, renin is released from the kidneys, converting angiotensinogen to angiotensin I.  Subsequently, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II.  Angiotensin II then increases aldosterone secretion from the adrenal cortex, leading to increased sodium and fluid retention in the collecting tubules of the kidneys.  Angiotensin II is also a potent vasoconstrictor that ultimately increases systemic vascular resistance and arterial pressure. $Angiotensin II itself is involved in 2 negative feedback mechanisms that help regulate the RAAS.  In short-loop negative feedback, elevated angiotensin II stimulates the angiotensin receptors on juxtaglomerular cells to inhibit renin release.  In long-loop negative feedback, increased blood pressure and sodium levels (due to angiotensin II) eventually decrease renin release via intrarenal baroreceptor and macula densa pathways, respectively. $#ACE inhibitors# such as ramipril block ACE and decrease the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, effectively blocking arteriolar vasoconstriction and aldosterone secretion.  In addition to decreased blood pressure and sodium levels, #decreased angiotensin II# levels also interfere with negative feedback mechanisms, ultimately activating the RAAS to #promote renin release#.  @ACE@ is also responsible for the breakdown of bradykinin; therefore, ACE inhibitors lead to i#ncreased bradykinin #levels, which are thought to cause the characteristic ACE inhibitor–induced cough. $#Educational objective# Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors block the effect of ACE, decreasing angiotensin II and aldosterone levels.  By decreasing angiotensin II levels, ACE inhibitors directly interrupt negative feedback loops, thereby increasing renin and angiotensin I levels.

  "explanation_2": "#Hypokalemia# is a common medical condition that can result from several mechanisms, including decreased oral intake, renal or gastrointestinal loss, and increased entry into cells.  In a patient receiving multiple doses of albuterol, the most likely etiology is #intracellular shift of potassium#. $Potassium is primarily stored intracellularly (~98% of total body stores) through the action of the #Na-K-ATPase pump#, which exchanges sodium for potassium against their concentration gradient.  The large concentration difference of intracellular (~150 mEq/L) to extracellular potassium (~4 mEq/L) is a major driver of the resting membrane potential.  Alterations in this ratio can impair action potential generation, explaining why patients with marked hyper- or hypokalemia can develop muscular weakness and cardiac arrhythmias. $#Beta-adrenergic activity# increases the activity of the Na-K-ATPase pump; therefore, both endogenous catecholamines and therapeutic beta-2 agonists (eg, #albuterol#, dobutamine) can cause #transient hypokalemia# due to increased #transport of potassium intracellularly#.  Similar effects can also occur with sympathomimetics (eg, pseudoephedrine) and insulin, which also increase Na-K-ATPase activity. $#(Choice A)#  Decreased oral intake of potassium is a rare cause of hypokalemia.  Because the kidneys can lower potassium excretion in the setting of reduced potassium intake, most patients do not develop hypokalemia unless fasting is prolonged (eg, starvation). $#(Choice B)#  Respiratory acidosis may occur as a complication of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease due to CO2 retention; however, acidosis causes potassium to shift to the extracellular space, leading to hyperkalemia (not hypokalemia).  In contrast, alkalosis causes intracellular shift of potassium, resulting in transient hypokalemia. $#(Choice C)#  Significant diaphoresis (eg, marathon running in a hot climate) can result in potassium depletion.  However, normal sweating (as could occur in patients with increased work of breathing) would not result in significant potassium loss. $#(Choice D)#  Increased urinary potassium loss can occur due to diuretic use or elevated aldosterone levels (eg, renovascular disease, primary hyperaldosteronism).  While beta-1 agonists can result in increased renin release (leading to elevated aldosterone levels and increased renal potassium loss), beta-2 agonists (eg, albuterol) do not have a significant effect on urinary potassium excretion. $#Educational objective# Potassium is primarily stored intracellularly (~98% of total body stores) through the action of the Na-K-ATPase pump.

Other medications associated with SIADH include antidepressants (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants), certain antidiabetic drugs (eg, chlorpropamide), and recreational drugs (eg, MDMA [ie, ecstasy]). $#(Choice A)#  Canagliflozin is a diabetic medication that inhibits sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 in the renal proximal tubule, increasing urinary glucose excretion.  Canagliflozin is linked to urinary tract infections and hypotension, but not SIADH. $#(Choices C and E)#  Furosemide and spironolactone are often used in combination to treat severe heart failure.  Furosemide reduces sodium reabsorption in the loop of Henle, increasing sodium and water excretion.  Spironolactone blocks the mineralocorticoid receptor, which increases sodium excretion and potassium reabsorption.  Both diuretics can induce hyponatremia; however, patients are typically also hypovolemic (eg, with dry mucous membranes and elevated BUN and creatinine).  This patient's euvolemia and normal BUN and creatinine are more consistent with SIADH. $#(Choice D)#  Lithium can cause ADH resistance in the renal collecting ducts, resulting in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.  In this condition, water cannot be reabsorbed; urine osmolality is low (dilute urine) and serum sodium and osmolality increase.  This patient has an opposite picture (high urine osmolality, low serum sodium and osmolality), indicating SIADH. $#Educational objective# The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) presents with hypotonic hyponatremia (ie, low serum osmolality and serum sodium), concentrated urine (ie, high urine osmolality), and euvolemia.  Carbamazepine can cause SIADH by increasing antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion and renal sensitivity to ADH.  ",

However, continued use leads to significant volume depletion that counteracts the diuretic effect by decreasing glomerular filtration pressure.  Reduced pressure natriuresis also decreases distal tubule Na+ delivery, which is sensed by the macula densa and causes activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.  Aldosterone then acts on the collecting tubule to enhance Na+ reabsorption and promote K+ and H+ loss.  Therefore,# loop and thiazide diuretics# cause #hypokalemia# and #metabolic alkalosis #secondary to volume contraction. $Loop diuretics function by inhibiting the absorption of solutes within the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop, a process that is critical for maintenance of the corticomedullary concentration gradient.  As a result, patients on loop diuretics are unable to maximally concentrate their urine and thus lose substantial amounts of both salt and water in the urine.  In contrast, patients taking thiazides have a normal corticomedullary concentration gradient and are better able to retain free water in response to increased vasopressin levels.  Thus, patients taking #thiazide diuretics# are more likely to retain free water and develop #hyponatremia#. $#Thiazide diuretics# can also lead to #hypercalcemia# secondary to increased proximal and distal tubule Ca2+ reabsorption.

  "explanation_2": "$The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is the most important neurohormonal system regulating sodium/fluid balance and arterial blood pressure in the body.  Regulation of the RAAS involves 3 major components: macula densa (distal tubule sodium sensor), intrarenal baroreceptors, and beta-adrenergic receptors.  Beta-adrenergic regulation is mediated through sympathetic stimulation of #beta-1 receptors# located on juxtaglomerular cells, which stimulate the release of renin. $#Beta-adrenergic antagonists# inhibit renin release, which in turn reduces the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I and reduces the levels of angiotensin II and aldosterone.  This effect on the RAAS is only partially responsible for beta blocker effects on blood pressure, and antihypertensive efficacy of beta blockers weakly correlates with plasma renin levels.  Beta blockers have no effect on ACE activity and, therefore, do not affect bradykinin levels. $#(Choice B)#  Direct renin inhibitors (aliskiren) block the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which leads to reduced levels of angiotensin I and II and aldosterone.  Plasma renin concentration is increased via suppression of the inhibitory feedback loop. $#(Choices C and D)#  ACE inhibitors prevent the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II and lead to decreased levels of angiotensin II and aldosterone, along with increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin I levels via inhibition of negative feedback.  ACE is also a kininase and normally degrades bradykinin in the body.  Therefore, ACE inhibitors lead to increased levels of bradykinin, which is responsible for the coughing seen in treated patients. $#(Choice E)#  Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) block the action of angiotensin II on angiotensin (AT1) receptors, which leads to increased levels of renin and angiotensin I and II.  ARBs have no effect on bradykinin levels. $#(Choice F)#  Aldosterone antagonists (spironolactone, eplerenone) compete with aldosterone for the receptor sites in the distal tubules.  They raise the levels of renin, angiotensin I and II, and aldosterone via inhibition of negative feedback. $#Educational objective# Beta-adrenergic blocking drugs inhibit renin release by blocking beta-1 receptor-mediated regulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.  This reduces plasma renin activity, with a resulting reduction in angiotensin I, angiotensin II, and aldosterone levels."

This causes a sudden sensation of urgency, with involuntary leakage of urine often occurring before reaching the toilet. $Pharmacologic therapy with #anticholinergic drugs# is useful for treating the condition.  These agents (eg, oxybutynin) antagonize muscarinic receptors, primarily the #M3 receptors# present on smooth muscle cells in the bladder.  Antagonism of M3 receptors decreases the production of IP3 and the release of calcium, leading to smooth muscle relaxation.  This causes #decreased involuntary detrusor contractions#, increased bladder capacity, and decreased sense of urgency. $Antimuscarinic agents often act on several types of muscarinic receptors and should be used with caution, especially in elderly patients.  These agents should be started at the lowest possible dose and titrated as needed to minimize anticholinergic side effects (dry mouth, blurred vision, tachycardia, drowsiness, and constipation). $#(Choice A)#  Alpha1-blockers such as doxazosin, prazosin and terazosin are useful for the treatment of both benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and hypertension.  They cause relaxation of the smooth muscle in arterial and venous walls, leading to a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance.  In patients with BPH, they also induce relaxation of the smooth muscle in the bladder neck and prostate, leading to a decrease in urinary obstruction. $#(Choice B)#  Beta-1 receptors are found in cardiac tissue and on renal juxtaglomerular cells.  Selective beta-1 blockers (eg, metoprolol) decrease heart rate and contractility, and block catecholamine-induced renin release by the kidney. $#(Choice D)#  Nicotinic cholinergic receptors are found on postganglionic neurons in sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia and on skeletal muscle cells at the neuromuscular junction.  Drugs that block skeletal muscle nicotinic receptors, such as tubocurarine, are often used during general anesthesia to induce paralysis. $#(Choice E)#  Central sympatholytics such as methyldopa and clonidine stimulate alpha-2 receptors centrally, which causes a decrease in generalized sympathetic outflow and a decrease in blood pressure.  Rebound hypertension is a concern with abrupt cessation. $#(Choice F)#  Beta-2 adrenergic receptors are located in the smooth muscle of airways, peripheral vasculature, and uterus.  Stimulation of these receptors causes bronchodilation, vasodilation, and tocolysis, respectively.  In contrast, bladder relaxation is mediated primarily by beta-3 adrenergic receptors. $#Educational objective# Urge incontinence, or overactive bladder syndrome, is caused by uninhibited bladder contractions (detrusor instability).  It results in a sense of urgency accompanied by an involuntary loss of urine.

Hyperphosphatemia is thought to be the inciting event in the onset of CKD-related mineral bone disorder.  Elevated blood phosphate triggers the release of fibroblast growth factor 23 from bone, which lowers calcitriol production and intestinal calcium absorption.  Reduced circulating calcium, along with hyperphosphatemia, leads to secondary hyperparathyroidism. $Dietary phosphorus restriction is recommended for patients with CKD.  However, oral #phosphate binders# are usually needed if dietary restriction is not sufficient to lower phosphate levels.  Phosphate binders can be calcium containing (eg, calcium carbonate/acetate) or non–calcium containing (eg, sevelamer, lanthanum).  #Sevelamer# is a #nonabsorbable anion-exchange resin# that binds intestinal phosphate to #reduce systemic absorption#.  The resulting complex is eliminated in the feces. $#(Choice A)#  Vitamin D receptor antagonists are largely experimental compounds that have been considered for the treatment of Paget disease of bone.  Most patients with CKD benefit from vitamin D supplementation due to decreased renal formation of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. $#(Choices C, D, and F)#  Parathyroid hormone induces internalization and destruction of type IIa sodium/phosphate cotransporters (NPT2) in the proximal renal tubule.  NPT2 gene expression is downregulated by fibroblast growth factor 23.  These processes lead to decreased transcellular transport (and therefore decreased reabsorption) of phosphate in the renal tubules. $#(Choice E)#  Parathyroid hormone functions to reduce phosphate reabsorption by the kidney; reduced secretion would worsen, not correct, hyperphosphatemia.  Sevelamer reduces circulating serum phosphorus by blocking intestinal absorption, which helps to mitigate secondary hyperparathyroidism. $#Educational objective# Chronic kidney disease can cause hyperphosphatemia due to decreased renal excretion of phosphorus.

  "explanation_2": "#Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)#, such as amitriptyline, inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin and are used in the treatment of depression.  They also #inhibit# fast #sodium channel conduction#, slowing down myocardial depolarization and potentially leading to #cardiac arrhythmias# in overdose.  #Refractory hypotension# results from decreased cardiac contractility and direct peripheral vasodilation (from peripheral alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonism).  Most deaths from #TCA overdose# are due to cardiac arrhythmias and refractory hypotension. $#Treatment# of TCA overdose involves #sodium bicarbonate# (NaHCO3) therapy.  NaHCO3 increases serum pH, promoting TCA dissociation from sodium channels, and increases extracellular sodium concentration.  These effects help overcome the sodium channel blockade induced by TCAs. $#(Choice A)#  TCAs cause antihistaminic effects by antagonizing histamine (H1) receptors.  This can cause increased sedation and appetite but is not implicated in death from TCAs. $#(Choice C)#  TCAs block the amine reuptake pumps within the synaptic cleft, which normally terminate amine transmission.  This permits a longer interaction between the neurotransmitter and the receptor, which is thought to account for TCA antidepressant properties.  However, synaptic norepinephrine accumulation is not the mechanism by which death occurs following TCA overdose. $#(Choice D)#  Serotonin syndrome must be considered in suspected antidepressant overdose.  Patients with serotonin syndrome have hyperthermia, autonomic instability, hyperreflexia, myoclonus, and diaphoresis.  Cardiac changes are not usually indicative of serotonin syndrome.  Although symptoms of excess serotonin may be present after TCA overdose, most deaths are due to cardiac toxicity. $#(Choice E)#  TCAs do not increase presynaptic release of dopamine.  Amphetamines increase the release of dopamine (and norepinephrine) by vesicles in presynaptic neurons. $#Educational objective# Tricyclic antidepressant overdose can cause fatal cardiac arrhythmias and refractory hypotension due to inhibition of fast sodium channels in cardiac myocytes.  Sodium bicarbonate is used to treat associated cardiac toxicity and works by increasing serum pH and extracellular sodium (alleviating fast sodium channel blockade).  "

  "explanation_2": "$This patient exhibits classic symptoms of a panic attack (abrupt and unexpected onset of characteristic physical symptoms and negative medical workup).  She most likely received a benzodiazepine, a medication commonly used in emergency settings because it provides rapid relief of acute anxiety. $Benzodiazepines work at the GABAA (γ-aminobutyric acid) receptor complex.  #GABA# is the #main inhibitory neurotransmitter# in the central nervous system and is synthesized from glutamate using glutamate decarboxylase.  The GABAA receptor complex consists of 5 subunits and a central chloride ion channel, with different binding sites for GABA and various drugs (eg, benzodiazepines, barbiturates).  #Benzodiazepines# act by binding to the benzodiazepine binding site, which #allosterically modulates# the #binding of GABA#, resulting in an #increased #frequency of #chloride ion channel opening#.  The influx of chloride ions into the neurons causes neuronal hyperpolarization and inhibition of the action potential.  Barbiturates act at a separate allosteric site and work by prolonging the duration of channel openings in response to GABA and, at higher doses, as GABAA receptor agonists. $#(Choice A)#  GABAB receptors mediate their actions using G proteins.  The skeletal muscle relaxant baclofen is an example of a drug that works as a GABAB receptor agonist.  Benzodiazepines work at the GABAA receptor. $#(Choice B)#  Benzodiazepines do not alter GABA metabolism.  Certain anti-epileptic medications, including valproic acid and vigabatrin, function to reduce GABA catabolism. $#(Choice D)#  Benzodiazepines do not function through direct activation of the GABAA receptor.  Instead, they work as positive allosteric modulators that promote an increased frequency of channel openings in response to GABA stimulation. $#(Choice E)#  Benzodiazepines do not function through blockage of the GABAA receptor lumen.  Examples of drugs that directly block the lumen of ion channels include amiloride (which affects epithelial sodium channels in the distal portions of the nephron) and verapamil (a calcium channel blocker). $#(Choice F)#  Prolonged benzodiazepine use has been shown to cause downregulation of GABAA receptors and may be one of the mechanisms by which benzodiazepine tolerance develops. $#Educational objective# Benzodiazepines act by binding to the benzodiazepine binding site, which allosterically modulates the binding of GABA, resulting in an increased frequency of chloride ion channel opening.

  "explanation_2": "This patient's acute onset of tremulousness, agitation, and elevated pulse and blood pressure within 48 hours of admission is suggestive of #alcohol withdrawal#.  Alcohol is a CNS depressant that binds to the GABAA receptor complex, enhancing the inhibitory action of GABA (the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain).  Abrupt cessation of alcohol decreases inhibitory tone and results in CNS excitation.  Alcohol withdrawal symptoms typically start within 8-12 hours after the last drink and include #insomnia, tremulousness, anxiety#, and #autonomic hyperactivity# (variable blood pressure, diaphoresis, and tachycardia).  Alcohol withdrawal seizures can occur within 12-48 hours, and delirium tremens (disorientation, severe agitation, fever) typically begins within 48-96 hours. $Alcohol, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines have similar effects on GABA receptors and act by enhancing GABA inhibitory action.  #Benzodiazepines# (eg, lorazepam, diazepam, chlordiazepoxide) are used as #first-line therapy# for psychomotor agitation associated with alcohol withdrawal and to prevent progression to seizures and delirium.  Longer-acting benzodiazepines and those with active metabolites are preferred in the majority of patients due to self-tapering effects, resulting in a smoother course of withdrawal. $#(Choice A)#  Baclofen is an agonist of GABA B receptors and is used to treat spastic conditions.  It is less effective than benzodiazepines for treating alcohol withdrawal. $#(Choice B)#  Carbamazepine may have a role in outpatient management of mild alcohol withdrawal, but there is insufficient evidence for its use in moderate to severe alcohol withdrawal. $#(Choices C and D)#  Chlorpromazine and haloperidol are antipsychotic medications that lower the seizure threshold.  They should not be used to treat alcohol withdrawal as these patients are already at significant risk for seizure. $#(Choice F)#  Phenobarbital is a barbiturate anticonvulsant that enhances GABA activity.  It is no longer used as first-line treatment for alcohol withdrawal because it has a worse safety profile than benzodiazepines. $#(Choice G)#  The beta blocker propranolol can treat tremor, tachycardia, and hypertension, but it has not been shown to prevent development of seizures or delirium tremens.  Treatment with benzodiazepines is the most crucial step in the management of alcohol withdrawal. $#Educational objective# Alcohol withdrawal should be considered in hospitalized patients who develop tremulousness, agitation, and elevated pulse and blood pressure within 48 hours following admission.

Its primary action is to #inhibit# dopamine #D2 receptors#, but it also has inhibitory effects on serotonergic and alpha-adrenergic pathways. $Secretion of prolactin from the anterior pituitary is primarily regulated by the inhibitory effect of hypothalamic dopamine; stimulation of D2 receptors on lactotrophs decreases the synthesis and release of prolactin.  Because risperidone and other antipsychotic drugs block D2 receptor activation, there is a #loss of the normal tonic inhibition of prolactin release#, leading to #hyperprolactinemia# in some cases.  This can result in galactorrhea and breast soreness.  In addition, elevated prolactin levels inhibit release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus, resulting in central hypogonadism and #amenorrhea#. $#(Choice A)#  Nonclassic 21-hydroxylase deficiency may be associated with menstrual irregularity (most often oligomenorrhea), hirsutism, and acne in women.  Nonclassic 21-hydroxylase deficiency most often presents in childhood or adolescence. $#(Choice B)#  Asherman syndrome refers to the presence of severe intrauterine adhesions that cause amenorrhea and infertility.  It typically occurs in patients who have had multiple dilation and curettage procedures or those with chronic endometritis. $#(Choice D)#  Polycystic ovary syndrome is characterized by infertility, oligomenorrhea, and hyperandrogenism.  It typically begins in adolescence and is unlikely to develop in a 38-year-old woman.  Most patients with polycystic ovary syndrome are obese.  Insulin resistance is thought to play a central role in its pathogenesis. $#(Choice E)#  Primary ovarian insufficiency is characterized by amenorrhea, hypoestrogenism, and elevated serum gonadotropin levels in women age <40.  The decreased estrogenic effect on breast tissue can cause a decline in breast density but would not cause tenderness. $#(Choice F)#  Severe weight loss (eg, anorexia nervosa), intense exercise, and/or severe stress can cause amenorrhea by inducing functional hypothalamic amenorrhea.  However, none of these would cause breast tenderness. $#Educational objective# The secretion of prolactin is controlled by the inhibitory effect of hypothalamic dopamine.  Risperidone and other antipsychotics cause hyperprolactinemia by blocking D2 receptors on lactotrophs.  Elevated prolactin leads to amenorrhea (inhibition of gonadotropin-releasing hormone release), galactorrhea, and breast soreness.  "

Although it antagonizes opioid effects at all receptor types, it has the #greatest affinity for mu receptors# (responsible for opioid-induced cardiorespiratory depression).  Naloxone competes with opioid medications, displacing them from opioid receptors; it is therefore an ideal agent for #reversing opioid intoxication/overdose#.  Reversal effects can occur within minutes, and the duration is dose dependent (usually 1-4 hours).  Naloxone must be given parenterally because it is metabolically inactivated by the liver when administered orally. $#(Choice A)#  Medications with an affinity for 5-HT (serotonin) receptors do not have a role in the treatment of opioid overdose.  Cyproheptadine, a 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A antagonist, is an oral medication that can be used to treat serotonin syndrome.  Ondansetron is a 5-HT3 antagonist that may be administered intravenously for nausea and vomiting. $#(Choices B and E)#  Delta and kappa are also opioid receptors that modulate pain.  Although naloxone does bind to these receptors, it binds to mu opioid receptors with greatest affinity. $#(Choices C and D)#  GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain and is the target of many drugs.  Benzodiazepines and barbiturates work by binding to specific sites on GABA A receptors to facilitate inhibitory effects of GABA.  Flumazenil is a GABA A benzodiazepine receptor antagonist used to reverse benzodiazepine intoxication.  Baclofen is an agonist at the GABA B receptor that acts as a skeletal muscle relaxant.  This patient's miosis and profound respiratory depression are more indicative of opioid overdose than benzodiazepine or baclofen intoxication. $#(Choice G)#  Glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter that binds to NMDA receptors.  Ketamine, a general anesthetic, is an example of an NMDA receptor antagonist.  Naloxone does not have effects on NMDA receptors. $#Educational objective# Naloxone is a pure opioid receptor antagonist used to treat opioid intoxication or overdose.  Although it binds to mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptors, it has the greatest affinity for mu receptors (which mediate opioid-induced bradycardia and respiratory depression), making it an ideal agent for treating opioid intoxication.

In severe cases, #psychotic symptoms# (eg, hallucinations, delusions), #seizures#, and even #death# may occur.  Risk of withdrawal is greatest with short-acting agents (eg, alprazolam), prolonged use, and use of higher doses. $Benzodiazepines act on the GABAA receptor, enhancing the action of the natural ligand, GABA.  The body adapts to chronic benzodiazepine exposure by downregulating the GABAA receptor, leading to tolerance, a phenomenon in which the same dose of a medication yields decreasing effects over time.  This same adaptive downregulation process is responsible for the withdrawal syndrome when benzodiazepines are discontinued and the body is unable to balance opposing excitatory neurotransmitters.  Benzodiazepine withdrawal is treated by starting a patient on a long-acting benzodiazepine (eg, diazepam) and planning for an extended, gradual taper. $#(Choices A and G)#  The anticonvulsants lamotrigine and valproate are used in bipolar disorder for their mood-stabilizing properties.

  "explanation_2": "$The pathophysiologic basis of depression is hypothesized to involve the dysregulation of monoamine (eg, serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine) neurotransmission.  Most antidepressant medications act by various mechanisms to increase synaptic concentrations of these neurotransmitters, particularly serotonin.  Monoamine oxidase (MAO) is an enzyme located in presynaptic nerve terminals that is responsible for the breakdown of monoamine neurotransmitters.  #Phenelzine#, a #monoamine oxidase inhibitor#, works by irreversibly binding and inhibiting both types of MAO: A and B.  This results in increased presynaptic availability of monoamine neurotransmitters, thereby increasing their release into the synaptic cleft.  Because phenelzine irreversibly inhibits MAO, it may take up to 2 weeks following discontinuation of the drug before MAO is resynthesized to a level adequate for normal monoamine degradation. $Sertraline is a @selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor@ (SSRI) that specifically increases synaptic serotonin levels.  Coadministration of an SSRI and an MAO inhibitor is contraindicated due to the risk of #serotonin syndrome#, a potentially fatal condition characterized by altered mental status, neuromuscular excitation (eg, hyperreflexia, clonus), and autonomic hyperactivity (eg, hyperthermia, tachycardia, diaphoresis).  To avoid serotonin syndrome, patients must wait at least 2 weeks after MAO inhibitor discontinuation before initiating SSRI therapy, thereby allowing sufficient time for regeneration of the MAO enzyme. $#(Choice A)#  Monoamine (eg, serotonin) receptors are G protein–coupled receptors.  Internalization of activated G protein–coupled receptors plays a role in downregulating postsynaptic signal transduction when synaptic monoamine levels are chronically increased.  However, this is not the reason for the 2-week washout period from phenelzine, which is required to resynthesize the irreversibly inhibited MAO enzyme. $#(Choice B)#  Inositol monophosphatase inhibition is hypothesized to be one of the mechanisms by which lithium exerts its antidepressant and antimanic effects.  Inositol monophosphatase is not affected by MAO inhibitors. $#(Choice C)#  MAO inhibition arrests the breakdown of monoamines, thereby increasing their release into the synaptic cleft.  Overall MAO functioning gradually increases after discontinuation of irreversible MAO inhibitors (eg, tranylcypromine, phenelzine) as new MAO is synthesized. $#(Choice D)#  Increased monoamine neurotransmission due to antidepressant treatment causes downregulation of postsynaptic monoamine (eg, serotonin) receptors, decreasing their density within the synaptic cleft.  This (along with other chronic, downstream neuromodulatory changes) is responsible for the delayed clinical effects of antidepressants. $#(Choice E)#  Presynaptic monoaminergic neurons actively take up norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin through reuptake transporters and repackage them into synaptic vesicles for future neurotransmission.  Monoamine reuptake inhibitors, such as tricyclic antidepressants and SSRIs, work by blocking this reuptake. $#Educational objective# Coadministration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors can produce excessive synaptic serotonin levels secondary to decreased reuptake and decreased degradation of serotonin, potentially causing serotonin syndrome.  To avoid this risk, a 2-week washout period after discontinuing an MAO inhibitor and before initiating SSRI therapy is required to allow sufficient time for MAO regeneration.  ",

OCD is characterized by obsessions or compulsions, with most patients experiencing both.  Common themes include contamination obsessions with cleaning compulsions; obsession with symmetry and compulsions involving ordering and counting; and fear of harm with checking compulsions (eg, stove off, doors locked).  Patients with OCD typically engage in time-consuming rituals (>1 hr/day) that cause significant distress and/or functional impairment.  Patients with washing compulsions may present with skin conditions. $#Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor# (SSRI) antidepressants are considered first-line treatment for OCD.  SSRIs block the reuptake of serotonin into the presynaptic neuron, leading to an immediate increase in availability of synaptic serotonin and a subsequent cascade of downstream neurobiological effects. $#(Choice A)#  In the central nervous system, acetylcholine is involved primarily in arousal, memory, and learning.  Degeneration of cholinergic neurons is associated with Alzheimer dementia. $#(Choices B and D)#  There is evidence for dysfunction of the dopamine and glutamate (primary excitatory neurotransmitter) systems in the pathogenesis of OCD; however, neither neurotransmitter is a significant target of first-line medications. $#(Choices C and E)#  Gamma-aminobutyric acid is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system and is involved in the anti-anxiety effects of benzodiazepines.  Glycine is also an inhibitory neurotransmitter. $#(Choice F)#  Histamine is a neurotransmitter involved in maintaining wakefulness and, as a result, drugs with antihistamine properties may be sedating. $#(Choice G)#  Norepinephrine is a catecholamine involved in mood, anxiety, alertness, learning, and memory. $#Educational objective# Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by persistent, intrusive thoughts leading to repetitive, ritualistic behaviors.

Patients describe an inability to sit or stand in one position and may pace frequently or demonstrate other restless behaviors.  Treatment options include decreasing the antipsychotic dose (if feasible) or treating with a beta blocker or benzodiazepines. $#(Choice A)#  Acute dystonia is an extrapyramidal side effect characterized by acute onset of involuntary muscle contraction of the neck, mouth, tongue, or eye muscles.  It occurs within hours to days of antipsychotic use, especially with rapid dose escalation of high-potency, first-generation antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol), and is treated with anticholinergic medication (eg, diphenhydramine, benztropine). $#(Choice C)#  Drug-induced parkinsonism is an extrapyramidal side effect that presents with cogwheel rigidity, masked facies, bradykinesia, tremor, and decreased arm swing.  Treatment is usually with anticholinergics (eg, benztropine). $#(Choice D)#  Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is an acute, potentially fatal reaction to antipsychotic medications.  Patients have hyperthermia, sympathetic hyperactivity (eg, tachycardia, diaphoresis), severe \"lead pipe\" rigidity, and altered mental status. $#(Choice E)#  This patient reports that her auditory hallucinations have resolved and shows no other signs of psychosis.  The physical restlessness of akathisia may be mistaken for psychotic agitation.  It is important to differentiate the two etiologies as increasing the antipsychotic dose will further exacerbate akathisia. $#(Choice F)#  Tardive dyskinesia is an involuntary and potentially irreversible movement disorder due to prolonged antipsychotic exposure (typically years).  Characteristic movements include lip smacking, biting, grimacing, tongue protrusions, and choreoathetoid movements of the head, limbs, and trunk. $#Educational objective# Akathisia is an extrapyramidal side effect of antipsychotic medication characterized by inner restlessness and an inability to sit or stand in one position.

  "explanation_2": "The second-generation antipsychotic #clozapine# is the only antipsychotic that has consistently shown superior efficacy in #treatment-resistant schizophrenia# and schizophrenia associated with persistent suicidality.  Clozapine has affinity for multiple dopamine and serotonin receptors, but the precise pharmacological mechanism responsible for its superior efficacy is unknown.  Clozapine binds loosely and transiently to dopamine D2 receptors, causing significantly fewer extrapyramidal symptoms compared to first-generation antipsychotics. $#Neutropenia# (<1000 cells/mm3) and the potential for life-threatening #agranulocytosis# are the major adverse effects of clozapine.  The risk of agranulocytosis is approximately 1%; therefore, treatment requires #regular monitoring #of the patient's #absolute neutrophil count#.  Treatment should be stopped if neutropenia occurs.  Seizures and myocarditis are other important adverse effects that require provider vigilance. $#(Choice B)#  Clozapine plasma levels can be checked after an initial target dose is reached, but further dosage adjustments are usually based on clinical response.  Clozapine levels are not regularly monitored. $#(Choices C and H)#  Creatinine levels and thyroid function tests should be monitored in patients taking lithium due to this drug's potential to adversely affect thyroid and renal function. $#(Choice D)#  Although a baseline ECG is required and physicians should be alert to the development of cardiovascular symptoms suggestive of myocarditis, routine ECGs are not required.  Among the second-generation antipsychotics, ziprasidone is most often noted for causing a prolonged QT interval. $#(Choices E and F)#  Liver function tests may be mildly elevated with the use of many psychotropic medications, including antipsychotics and anticonvulsants; thrombocytopenia can be caused by some anticonvulsants.  However, routine monitoring of liver function tests and platelets is not required with clozapine. $#(Choice G)#  Prolactin levels are not routinely monitored.  Among the second-generation antipsychotics, risperidone has been associated with a greater risk of prolactin elevation. $#Educational objective# Patients treated with clozapine are required to have regular monitoring of the absolute neutrophil count due to the risk of life-threatening agranulocytosis.

  "explanation_2": "This patient's history of major depression along with his current manic symptoms (ie, decreased need for sleep, grandiosity, goal-directed activity) indicate a diagnosis of bipolar disorder.  #Valproate# (valproic acid) is used as an #anticonvulsant# and #mood stabilizer#.

As an anticonvulsant, it effectively treats absence, myoclonic, and# generalized tonic-clonic seizures#.  It is the drug of choice for #myoclonic seizures# and a second-line agent for absence seizures (for which ethosuximide is preferred). $Other anticonvulsants used as mood stabilizers in bipolar disorder include carbamazepine and lamotrigine.  Carbamazepine is a CYP450 inducer that can cause lower levels of concomitant medications.  Lamotrigine is associated with skin rash, which rarely can progress to life-threatening mucocutaneous reactions (eg, Stevens-Johnson syndrome). $#(Choice A)#  Aripiprazole is a second-generation antipsychotic used to treat psychotic and mood disorders.  Antipsychotics are not indicated for seizures and may lower the seizure threshold. $#(Choice B)#  Citalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant.  SSRI monotherapy is avoided in bipolar disorder due to the risk of inducing mania.  SSRIs have no role in the treatment of seizures. $#(Choices C and F)#  Levetiracetam and phenytoin are anticonvulsants used in the treatment of epilepsy but they are not useful for treating bipolar disorder. $#(Choice D)#  Lithium is a mood stabilizer that is effective for the treatment of bipolar disorder.  Lithium is thought to modify second messenger signal transduction (eg, adenylyl cyclase and phospho-inositol pathways) at several levels, resulting in decreased excitatory neurotransmission.  Lithium is not an anticonvulsant. $#(Choice E)#  Lorazepam is a benzodiazepine that enhances the affinity of GABA for its receptor (increases frequency of chloride channel openings), thereby increasing its inhibitory potential.  Lorazepam is a first-line medication for the treatment of active seizures, acute anxiety, and alcohol withdrawal. $#Educational objective# Lithium and the anticonvulsants valproate, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine are mood-stabilizing agents used in bipolar disorder.

At higher doses, the agonist activity is equally opposed by the antagonist activity, leading to a plateau (ceiling) in the dose-response curve.

Therefore, high doses of buprenorphine carry a #lower risk of respiratory depression# compared to full agonists such as heroin #(choice C).# $A key drawback of partial agonists (eg, buprenorphine) is the potential to #displace full agonists# from the receptor: partial agonists act as relative antagonists in the presence of full agonists.

For this reason, patients must discontinue opioids and partially enter the withdrawal state (eg, wait 48 hours) prior to the initiation of buprenorphine. $#(Choice A)#  Complete reversal of a full agonist (eg, heroin) requires a full antagonist (eg, naloxone).  Because buprenorphine is a partial agonist-antagonist, the degree of reversal is limited by the ceiling effect. $#(Choice D)#  The ability of antagonists to displace bound drugs is determined by the affinity of the drug-receptor interaction.  Drugs that bind tightly have a steep binding curve; in other words, a lower concentration of drug is required to achieve the same effect.  Buprenorphine has a higher affinity to the mu receptor than heroin, which is apparent from its steeper binding curve.  Overdose with buprenorphine often requires repeated, high doses of naloxone due to this higher affinity. $#Educational objective# Buprenorphine is a semisynthetic opioid with mixed/partial agonist-antagonist activity, resulting in a therapeutic ceiling.  Relative to full opioid agonists, this reduces the risk of dose-dependent adverse effects such as respiratory depression.  "

These then relay their impulses to the medullary vomiting center, inducing emesis.  #5-HT3 receptor antagonists# (eg, ondansetron) are well-tolerated medications that are very effective at reducing nausea and vomiting caused by gastrointestinal upset. $#(Choice B)#  Loperamide is a µ-opioid receptor agonist that functions as an antimotility agent.  It is commonly used in TD to reduce diarrhea but can worsen nausea and vomiting due to colonic retention. $#(Choice C)#  Dopamine receptor antagonists (eg, metoclopramide, prochlorperazine) are effective in treating central nausea (seen in acute migraines) and also reduce migraine headache pain.  Dopamine antagonists have significant adverse effects including sedation and extrapyramidal symptoms; these are not the first-line treatment for nausea due to gastrointestinal upset. $#(Choices D and F)#  First-generation H1 receptor antagonists (eg, diphenhydramine, meclizine) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists (eg, scopolamine) are frequently used to treat vestibular nausea (eg, motion sickness).  Promethazine is a dopamine and H1 receptor antagonist that can also treat vestibular nausea.  All of these medications can cause significant sedation. $#(Choice E)#  H2 blockers (eg, famotidine) reduce gastric acid secretion and can alleviate symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux but do not treat nausea and vomiting. $#(Choice G)#  Somatostatin receptor agonists (eg, octreotide) inhibit bioactive amine release and are used to treat diarrhea in patients with carcinoid syndrome and vasoactive intestinal peptide-secreting tumors (ie, VIPoma).  They are also used for treatment of acute esophageal variceal hemorrhage. $#Educational objective# 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are useful for the treatment of visceral nausea due to gastrointestinal insults, such as gastroenteritis, chemotherapy, and general anesthesia.  Antihistamines and anticholinergics are recommended for vestibular nausea.  Dopamine antagonists are useful for nausea associated with migraine.  "

  "explanation_2": "The @vomiting reflex@ can be activated by either humoral or neuronal stimuli.  The #area postrema# in the fourth ventricle has a #chemoreceptor trigger zone# that can respond to many neurotransmitters, drugs, or toxins.  The #nucleus tractus solitarius# (NTS) in the medulla receives information from the area postrema, gastrointestinal (GI) tract via the vagus nerve, vestibular system, and central nervous system (eg, meninges, hypothalamus).  Neurons from the NTS project to other medullary nuclei and coordinate the vomiting process.  The 5 major receptors involved in stimulating the vomiting reflex in the area postrema and adjacent vomiting center nuclei are M1 muscarinic, D2 dopaminergic, H1 histaminic, 5-HT3 serotonergic, and neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptors. $#5-HT3 receptor antagonists# (eg, ondansetron, granisetron, dolasetron) are highly effective in preventing #chemotherapy-induced vomiting#.  These agents act by 2 primary mechanisms: blocking #vagus#-mediated nausea and vomiting (from the GI tract stimuli) and blocking central #serotonin# receptors in the area postrema and the NTS.  Other agents useful for chemotherapy-induced vomiting include NK1 #receptor antagonists# (eg, aprepitant), which inhibit substance P and help prevent both acute vomiting and delayed emesis; and dopamine receptor antagonists (eg, metoclopramide), which are associated with drowsiness and dystonic reactions. $#(Choices A and D)#  Histamine blockers and antimuscarinic/anticholinergic agents are most helpful for vestibular nausea and vomiting. $#(Choice B)#  Motilin regulates interdigestive migrating contractions.

Bacteria in the distal intestine can also ferment the lactose, producing fatty acids and gasses that cause additional abdominal distension, pain, and flatulence.  Symptoms resolve when milk-containing products are eliminated from the diet. $#(Choice A)#  Diarrhea in carcinoid syndrome is secretory and high in electrolytes.  High amounts of circulating serotonin stimulate 5-HT4 receptors in the colon, increasing fluid secretion. $#(Choice B)#  In Crohn disease, intestinal inflammation leads to dysregulated ion transport and impaired epithelial barrier function.  Consequently, colonic fluid secretion outweighs fluid reabsorption, resulting in diarrhea that is secretory, bloody, and leukocytic (inflammatory diarrhea). $#(Choice C)#  Irritable bowel syndrome is a functional intestinal disorder that presents with diarrhea alternating with constipation, abdominal pain, and distension without organic cause.  Fecal water and electrolyte content are normal. $#(Choice E)#  Rectal prolapse is a protrusion of rectal mucosa through the anus associated with pregnancy and constipation; the risk is also increased in patients with chronic diarrhea. $#Educational objective# Polyethylene glycol is an osmotic laxative.

  "explanation_2": "This patient's heartburn is likely related to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a common disorder that occurs when gastric acid refluxes into the esophagus.  Management consists of lifestyle and dietary modifications (eg, weight loss, avoidance of tobacco) as well as medications that suppress gastric acid secretion. $#Proton pump inhibitors# (PPIs) (eg, pantoprazole, omeprazole) are the most effective inhibitors of gastric acid secretion.  They bind to and irreversibly #inhibit the H+/K+# #ATPase# on parietal cells.  Side effects are related to elevated gastric pH and include an increased risk of Clostridioides difficile and nutritional deficiencies (eg, calcium, magnesium, iron). $Although less potent than PPIs, #histamine 2 receptor antagonists# (eg, famotidine, cimetidine) are also used as first-line therapy for GERD.  They inhibit gastric acid secretion by targeting histamine receptors on parietal cells.  These medications are less side effect–prone than PPIs; however, they have a slower onset of action, and tachyphylaxis is common. $#(Choice A)#  Gastrin, a hormone released from G cells, binds to cholecystokinin (CCK) B receptors and stimulates gastric acid secretion both directly (through binding on parietal cells) and indirectly (through binding on enterochromaffin-like cells to increase histamine release).  CCK receptor antagonists are not routinely used in clinical practice. $#(Choice B)#  Sucralfate forms a viscous paste in the stomach, providing a cytoprotective layer that prevents the diffusion of gastric acid.  It is less effective than PPIs and is typically used as an adjunctive medication for peptic ulcer disease. $#(Choice D)#  Octreotide is a somatostatin analogue that inhibits gastrin synthesis (as well as many other gastrointestinal hormones).  It is sometimes used in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, but is not routinely used for GERD. $#(Choice E)#  Misoprostol is a prostaglandin E1 analogue that binds prostaglandin receptors on parietal cells, reducing gastric acid production and inducing secretion of mucus and bicarbonate.  Misoprostol can be used to prevent NSAID–induced gastric ulcers, but is less helpful for treating GERD; its significant uterotonic effects (eg, uterine contractions, cervical ripening) also limit its use in women of childbearing age. $#Educational objective# Management of gastroesophageal reflux disease includes lifestyle and dietary modifications (eg, weight loss, tobacco avoidance) and medications such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) (eg, pantoprazole, omeprazole) or histamine 2 receptor antagonists (eg, famotidine).  PPIs irreversibly inhibit the H+/K+ ATPase on parietal cells, which decreases gastric acid secretion.  "

  "explanation_2": "This patient with abdominal distension and a fluid wave has #ascites#.  His heavy alcohol use and evidence of chronic liver disease (eg, spider angiomas, thrombocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia, elevated PT) suggest the ascites developed due to #alcohol-associated cirrhosis#. $In cirrhosis, portal hypertension leads to splanchnic vasodilation, which decreases the effective arterial volume and lowers the systemic blood pressure.  Renal perfusion is reduced, leading to activation of the @#renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system# (RAAS),@ which promotes vasoconstriction (due to angiotensin) and fluid and sodium retention by the kidneys (due to aldosterone).  Although this improves systemic blood pressure and renal perfusion, due to the altered hemodynamics in patients with cirrhosis (eg, elevated hydrostatic pressure due to portal hypertension, low oncotic pressure due to hypoalbuminemia) it ultimately results in third spacing of fluid with edema and ascites. $#Spironolactone#, an #aldosterone antagonist#, is used to interrupt this cycle.  It induces natriuresis without blocking the critical vasoconstrictive effects of angiotensin.  Spironolactone is typically used with furosemide (a loop diuretic) to increase the efficacy of natriuresis and prevent electrolyte disturbances. $#(Choices B and C)#  Patients with cirrhosis have low mean arterial pressure due to splanchnic vasodilation and are dependent on the RAAS to help normalize blood pressure and renal perfusion.  ACE inhibitors (eg, lisinopril) and angiotensin receptor blockers blunt this critical response and promote organ hypoperfusion.  Likewise, blockade of alpha-adrenergic receptors would cause widespread vasodilation with decreased systemic blood pressure, worsening renal perfusion and causing additional fluid accumulation. $#(Choice D)#  Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) levels are increased in cirrhosis, which contributes to the development of hypervolemic hyponatremia.  Although ADH inhibitors (eg, tolvaptan) have been used to treat severe hyponatremia in cirrhosis, they are not indicated in patients with normal sodium levels. $#(Choice E)#  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs inhibit prostaglandin production, which can cause renal vasoconstriction and may precipitate gastrointestinal bleeding.  These medications should be avoided in patients with cirrhosis due to impaired renal perfusion at baseline and high risk of variceal bleeding. $#Educational objective# Ascites in cirrhosis develops from hemodynamic changes related to portal hypertension.  Splanchnic vasodilation decreases the systemic vascular resistance, which causes activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and promotes vasoconstriction and sodium and water retention.

They are primarily composed of cholesterol monohydrate crystals but can contain variable amounts of calcium salts, bilirubin, and mucin.  Normally, bile acids and phospholipids solubilize the cholesterol to prevent stone formation.  Decreased amounts of bile acids and phospholipids can cause the bile to become supersaturated with cholesterol, allowing it to crystallize and form cholesterol gallstones.  Risk factors for stone formation include increasing age, obesity, excessive bile salt loss (eg, terminal ileum disease), and female sex. $Cholecystectomy is the preferred treatment for symptomatic gallstones.  However, medical therapy is an option in patients refusing surgery or with high surgical risk.  Administration of #hydrophilic bile acids# (eg, ursodeoxycholic acid) reduces cholesterol secretion and increases biliary bile acid concentration.

  "explanation_2": "This patient has acute diarrhea likely due to viral gastroenteritis.  Because he is able to tolerate intake by mouth (ie, no severe nausea or ongoing vomiting), an #oral rehydration solution# (ORS), such as Pedialyte, is an appropriate treatment.  Acute diarrhea causes loss of total body water and electrolytes, which places patients at risk for several complications: $• #Hypovolemia# is due to intestinal loss of #sodium#, the major extracellular osmole that maintains circulating volume status.  Sodium is @absorbed@ at the gut brush border by 1:1 #cotransport with glucose# via sodium-glucose luminal cotransporter-1 (SGLT-1) lining the apical surface of enterocytes.  Therefore, all ORSs contain sodium and dextrose (ie, D-glucose) in #equimolar amounts#. $• #Metabolic acidosis# (with normal anion gap) is due to loss of bicarbonate in diarrheal secretions.  ORSs typically contain #citrate#, which is metabolized to bicarbonate in the liver, providing a buffering capacity to help correct the acidosis #(choice A).# $• #Hypokalemia# is due to loss of potassium-rich diarrheal secretions.  ORSs typically contain a modest amount of potassium, quickly absorbed by passive diffusion in the small intestine. $Solutions such as fruit juices that have high sugar content (eg, glucose ≥50 g/L) are generally avoided because they may induce a superimposed osmotic diarrhea.  The total osmolality of ORSs is designed to be roughly isotonic to the gut lumen #(choice B).# $#(Choice D)#  Dextrose is provided at 5% (eg, D5W) for intravenous fluids to prevent osmotic swelling and hemolysis of red blood cells, which would occur with true free water.  However, enterocytes are already bathed in a rich mucous layer containing osmoles; they do not lyse even when drinking pure water. $#(Choice E)#  Because the concentration of dextrose in ORSs is limited, they provide only a trivial caloric content (eg, 75 kcal/L).  Caloric deprivation is well tolerated during acute illnesses such as gastroenteritis; patients can safely fast for several days.  However, hydration and intravascular volume status must be maintained. $#Educational objective# Oral rehydration solutions contain equimolar amounts of dextrose (glucose) and sodium, which are absorbed through intestinal cotransport to maintain intravascular volume status.  They also contain potassium to compensate for gastrointestinal losses, and citrate to buffer metabolic acidosis.  ",

Aluminum absorption in the gastrointestinal tract is minimal from the salt form, and toxicity tends to occur in patients with chronic kidney disease that limits renal excretion.  Combination therapy does not alter systemic absorption. $#(Choice B)#  Drug interactions are common with antacid medications, largely due to pH-related changes in protein binding, absorption, or elimination of the drugs.  Combining multiple alkalinizing agents would not minimize their effects on other drugs. $#(Choice C)#  Rebound acid hypersecretion can occur with calcium carbonate, magnesium hydroxide, aluminum hydroxide, and proton pump inhibitors.  This is likely due to increased gastrin release as a result of gastric alkalinization or (in the case of calcium salts) direct ionic stimulation. $#(Choice E)#  Milk-alkali syndrome is caused by excessive use of calcium carbonate antacids and is characterized by hypercalcemia, alkalosis, and renal dysfunction.  Kidney injury occurs due to both hypercalcemia-induced renal vasoconstriction and calcium-induced diuresis.  The resultant volume depletion, decreased glomerular filtration rate, and alkali intake lead to a metabolic alkalosis.

Pathogenesis of Wilson disease involves @impaired hepatocellular copper transport@, which results in #decreased biliary excretion of copper#.  The resultant increase in intracellular copper causes oxidative stress and apoptosis of hepatocytes, which leads to liver dysfunction (eg, elevated transaminases, liver failure).  Excess copper is then released into the bloodstream and deposited into extrahepatic tissues, causing neurologic (eg, tremor, ataxia) and psychiatric symptoms (eg, impulsivity, depressive symptoms).  Although renal excretion of copper in healthy patients is extremely low, the relative increase in serum copper in Wilson disease results in increased urinary excretion of copper, as seen in this patient. $#First-line treatment# of Wilson disease is with #penicillamine#, a #copper chelating agent#.  Penicillamine binds free copper as well as reduces copper bound to other proteins.  This reduction preferentially increases affinity of copper to the chelating agent.

  "explanation_2": "This patient with heartburn and regurgitation has the classic manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux disease, a common disorder that occurs when gastric acid refluxes into the esophagus.  The mainstay of therapy is gastric acid suppression, usually with #proton pump inhibitors# (PPIs) (eg, pantoprazole, omeprazole). $PPIs irreversibly inhibit the @hydrogen-potassium-ATPase pump@ found in parietal cells, thereby inhibiting hydrochloric acid secretion into the stomach lumen.  Although this effectively raises the stomach pH and prevents gastric acid irritation of the esophagus, the acidic environment of the stomach is necessary to absorb certain nutrients.  Therefore, common adverse effects of PPIs include malabsorption of calcium, iron, magnesium, and vitamin B12 #(choices B, D, and E)#. $Patients with #pancreatic insufficiency# (eg, cystic fibrosis, chronic pancreatitis) cannot synthesize the pancreatic enzymes required for digestion of protein, fat, and carbohydrates.  As such, the condition is managed with pancreatic enzyme replacements, which contain varying amounts of lipase, amylase, and protease.  Unlike amylase and protease, which are activated by the low pH of the stomach, #lipase#, which plays a vital role in fat digestion, is #inactivated by the acidic environment# of the stomach.  Therefore, by decreasing gastric hydrochloric acid production, #PPI use increases lipase activity# (ie, it prevents exogenous lipase from being denatured as it passes through the stomach), #enhancing fat absorption# in patients dependent on pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. $#(Choice A)#  Protein digestion of amino acids requires the activity of a protease known as pepsin, which is more active at low pH.  Although one might expect the elevated stomach pH to inhibit protein absorption, chronic PPI use has not been associated with protein malabsorption (likely due to functional overlap with pancreatic and enteric proteases). $#Educational objective# Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) prevent the hydrogen-potassium-ATPase pump found in parietal cells from releasing hydrochloric acid into the stomach lumen.  Chronic PPI use protects exogenously administered lipase and enhances fat absorption in patients dependent on pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy.  ",

When acetaminophen dosage is appropriate, NAPQI is conjugated by glutathione into a nontoxic compound and eliminated in the urine.  However, an acetaminophen overdose #depletes intrahepatic glutathione#, causing the NAPQI level to rise and cause #hepatotoxicity#. $Concomitant #acute ethanol ingestion# can potentially reduce acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity.  Although ethanol is primarily metabolized by @alcohol dehydrogenase@, it can also be converted to acetaldehyde by cytochrome P450 2E1.  Through #competitive inhibition# of cytochrome P450 2E1, ethanol can decrease metabolism of acetaminophen to NAPQI and therefore #decrease NAPQI concentrations#. $Notably, although some of these patients may experience less hepatotoxicity from acetaminophen overdose than expected, the amount of ethanol that confers this protective effect is unknown and ethanol should therefore not be considered an antidote for acetaminophen toxicity.  Moreover, ethanol itself can cause hepatotoxicity when consumed excessively. $#(Choices B and E)#  In contrast to acute ethanol ingestion, chronic consumption can lead to nutritional deficiencies and chronic oxidative damage that decrease intrahepatic glutathione synthesis.  In addition, cytochrome P450 2E1 activity is upregulated by chronic ethanol use.  As a result chronic alcohol consumption increases NAPQI concentrations and the risk of hepatotoxicity during an acetaminophen overdose. $#(Choice C)#  Impairment of glucuronidation would decrease conversion of acetaminophen to nontoxic metabolites and increase the amount of acetaminophen converted to NAPQI, worsening hepatotoxicity. $#(Choice D)#  Activated charcoal is a highly absorbent powder that binds to drugs and toxins, including acetaminophen, and is sometimes used to limit intestinal absorption after an overdose.  However, ethanol does not affect intestinal absorption of acetaminophen. $#Educational objective# Acetaminophen and ethanol are metabolized by the same cytochrome P450 enzyme.  Through competitive inhibition, acute (not chronic) ingestion of ethanol can lead to decreased conversion of acetaminophen to N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (a toxic metabolite), potentially reducing acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity.

Gastrin induces acid production directly by binding parietal cells and indirectly by binding enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells and inducing histamine release. $#Proton pump inhibitors# (PPIs) (eg, omeprazole, lansoprazole) inhibit the hydrogen-potassium-ATPase pump and #decrease hydrochloric acid# production regardless of stimuli.  The resultant increase in gastric pH leads to #increased gastrin# formation, which induces hypertrophy of the ECL and parietal cells.  #Withdrawal# of the PPI results in overstimulation of the parietal cells with hyperfunctioning of the unblocked ATPase, leading to #rebound gastric acid hypersecretion# and reflux symptoms.  PPIs can be slowly tapered to help prevent this adverse effect. $#(Choice A)#  Acetylcholine (released with vagal stimulation) binds to parietal cell muscarinic (M3) receptors and promotes the secretion of hydrochloric acid.  Downregulation of vagal tone would likely relieve, rather than cause, the patient's symptoms. $#(Choice C)#  Prostaglandins decrease acid production by inhibiting the downstream messenger of histamine and increases bicarbonate formation from gastric epithelial cells.  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (eg ibuprofen) inhibit prostaglandin formation and increase the risk of gastritis and peptic ulcer formation.  Increased prostaglandin formation after drug withdrawal would be protective against gastritis. $#(Choice D)#  Chronic Helicobacter pylori infection causes atrophic gastritis with parietal cell destruction.  The effects of hypergastrinemia are masked in these patients due to the inability of the remaining parietal cells to create large volumes of acid.  Reinfection is very rare, and the correlation with PPI withdrawal makes rebound hypersecretion more likely. $#(Choice E)#  Somatostatin inhibits histamine and gastrin release; upregulation would lead to reduced gastric acid formation. $#Educational objective# Elevated gastric pH stimulates secretion of gastrin, a polypeptide hormone that increases gastric acid production.  Proton pump inhibitors block gastric acid production by parietal cells; the resultant increase in pH leads to hypergastrinemia, which can cause rebound hypersecretion of gastric acid when the drug is withdrawn.

Patients with cirrhosis have diminished metabolism of estrogen, leading to gynecomastia and other signs of hyperestrogenism (eg, spider angiomas).  However, spironolactone does not affect hepatic estrogen metabolism. $#(Choice B)#  Continuous administration of GnRH agonists (eg, leuprolide), such as in patients with metastatic prostate cancer, suppresses the release of FSH and LH, which leads to lower testosterone levels.  FSH and LH are also suppressed by starvation, leading to lower testosterone production and possible gynecomastia. $#(Choice D)#  Sex hormone–producing adrenal tumors are rare neoplasms that can produce excessive quantities of androgens, estrogens (leading to gynecomastia), or both.  Spironolactone decreases testicular production of testosterone, but adrenal estrogen production is not significantly increased. $#(Choice E)#  Secretion of hCG by testicular germ cell tumors impairs testosterone production in testicular Leydig cells while increasing aromatase activity and conversion of androgens to estrogens; the increased estrogen/androgen ratio can cause gynecomastia. $#Educational objective# Spironolactone is an aldosterone antagonist commonly used to treat heart failure.

  "explanation_2": "$This older patient with urinary hesitancy and multiple bone lesions has biopsy evidence of well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, raising strong suspicion for #metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma#.  Prostate cancer is the most common non-skin cancer in men; it has a predilection for metastases to #bone# due to tumor surface proteins that bind to pericytes and bone marrow stromal cells. $Prostate adenocarcinoma is generally an #androgen-sensitive tumor#.  Because androgens in men are produced primarily in the testes, initial treatment for advanced disease usually involves medical or surgical orchiectomy to eliminate testicular production of androgens.  However, androgens are also produced in the adrenal glands and tumor cells via the expression of #17-alpha-hydroxylase#, a cytochrome P-450 enzyme that converts pregnenolone/progesterone into dehydroepiandrosterone #(DHEA)#/#androstenedione#.  Because these extratesticular androgens can also drive tumor growth, patients with advanced disease and those with castration-resistant prostate cancer generally receive #abiraterone#, a medication that irreversibly #inhibits 17-alpha-hydroxylase#.  This limits extratesticular androgen production, which slows the growth of the tumor. $#(Choice A)#  Because prostate cancer is an androgen-sensitive tumor, activation of the androgen receptor would worsen the disease. $#(Choice B)#  LH triggers Leydig cells in the testes to produce androgens.  Therefore, activation of the LH receptor would worsen prostate cancer (increased androgen production).  Medical orchiectomy involves the administration of GnRH analogues, which reduce LH levels by eliminating the pulsatile stimulation of pituitary gonadotrophs. $#(Choice C)#  Estrogen receptor blockade is used in the treatment of estrogen-sensitive breast and endometrial cancer.  Prostate cancer is driven by androgens such as testosterone and DHEA, not estrogen. $#(Choice D)#  FSH induces spermatogenesis in men; LH is responsible for testicular androgen production.  Therefore, blockade of FSH would not inhibit systemic androgen generation. $#Educational objective# Patients with advanced or castration-resistant prostate cancer are often treated with an 17-alpha-hydroxylase inhibitors (eg, abiraterone), which block the generation of androgens in the adrenal glands, testes, and tumor cells.

Anaphylaxis classically involves a @type 1 (immediate) hypersensitivity@ reaction to an antigen, resulting in IgE-mediated mast cell and basophil degranulation.  Sudden and #massive release of inflammatory mediators# (eg, histamine, leukotrienes) into the circulation can quickly lead to urticaria, oropharyngeal edema (eg, lip swelling), and shock (eg, hypotension, tachycardia). $#Epinephrine# is the only pharmacologic therapy that both decreases the release of inflammatory mediators from mast cells and addresses all other manifestations of anaphylaxis.  It binds to adrenergic receptors (eg, beta-2 receptors) on the surface of mast cells, #inhibiting mast cell degranulation#.  In addition, it #counteracts existing inflammatory effects# via widespread stimulation of alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors: $• Alpha-1: causes vasoconstriction and decreases vascular permeability, raising blood pressure and decreasing upper airway edema $• Beta-1: increases cardiac contractility and cardiac output, improving blood pressure and peripheral perfusion $• Beta-2: causes bronchodilation, relieving airflow obstruction $Because of its ability to both treat and prevent further inflammatory mediator effects, epinephrine is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis. $#(Choice A)#  @H1 antagonists@ (eg, diphenhydramine) block tissue histamine receptors, preventing the effects of circulating histamine on capillaries (eg, vasodilation, increased vascular permeability).  However, they do not decrease the mast cell release of histamine or other inflammatory mediators. $#(Choice B)#  Omalizumab is a monoclonal anti-IgE antibody that binds to free IgE at the same site where IgE normally binds to mast cell IgE Fc receptors.  It prevents receptor binding and decreases circulating IgE levels, which eventually induces IgE Fc receptor down-regulation to help stabilize mast cells. $#(Choice C)#  Zileuton, a medication commonly used in the management of asthma, decreases the leukocyte synthesis of leukotrienes by @inhibiting 5-lipoxygenase@.  This results in decreased leukotriene activity, reducing inflammation and bronchospasm. $#(Choice E)#  Glucocorticoids reduce inflammation by several mechanisms.  One such mechanism is by promoting eosinophil apoptosis, either directly or by decreasing production of IL-5, which usually promotes eosinophil survival.  This decreases the number of circulating eosinophils. $#Educational objective# Anaphylaxis is a type 1 (immediate) hypersensitivity reaction involving IgE-mediated mast cell and basophil degranulation.

  "explanation_2": "Dyspnea, hypotension, and tachycardia soon after administration of β-lactam antibiotics are suggestive of anaphylactic shock.  Hypotension occurs in anaphylactic shock secondary to collapse of peripheral vascular resistance, increases in vascular permeability, and leakage of capillary fluid.  Stimulation of the smooth muscle tone within the bronchial wall, along with an increase in bronchial secretion, accounts for the dyspnea seen in anaphylaxis.  Skin symptoms (urticaria and angioedema) may occur secondary to vasodilatation and increased vascular permeability of skin capillaries.  Increases in GI smooth muscle tone may result in vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea. $Epinephrine is the drug of choice for the treatment of anaphylactic shock due to its ability to reverse all of the pathophysiologic mechanisms of anaphylaxis.  Stimulation of α1 receptors counteracts the vasodilatation of cutaneous and viscera vasculature, thus increasing blood pressure.  Epinephrine-mediated increases in cardiac contractility (β1 effect) and cardiac output also increase blood pressure and improve peripheral perfusion.  Epinephrine-induced stimulation of β2 receptors results in bronchodilatation, making it also a popular choice for the treatment of severe asthmatic reactions. $#(Choice A)#  Steroids inhibit inflammation by reducing capillary permeability and suppressing neutrophil activity.  Steroids also inhibit phospholipase A2, resulting in decreased formation of prostaglandin inflammatory mediators.  Because steroids anti-inflammatory effects are not acute, they are not effective in the acute treatment of life-threatening anaphylaxis.  Epinephrine should be given prior to steroids and antihistamines in the treatment of anaphylaxis. $#(Choice C)#  Norepinephrine has a predominantly alpha-1 adrenergic effect; thus, it can cause intense vasoconstriction, which may limit cardiac output.  Furthermore, it has little effect on the beta-2 adrenoceptor, so it has little or no bronchodilator action. $#(Choice D)#  Dobutamine is a synthetic drug with primary beta-1 adrenergic action that can cause an increased cardiac output without the other effects of epinephrine. $#(Choice E)#  Diphenhydramine is a first generation antihistamine drug that competitively inhibits peripheral H1 receptors in the GI tract, blood vessels, and respiratory tract.  Diphenhydramine may be used for the treatment of anaphylaxis after the patient is stabilized with epinephrine. $#Educational objective# Anaphylactic shock is characterized by vasodilatation, increased vascular permeability, and bronchoconstriction.  Epinephrine counteracts these physiological mechanisms and is the drug of choice for the treatment of anaphylaxis.  "

The face, neck, lips, and tongue are most commonly affected, but internal organs may also be involved.  Angioedema affecting the tracheobronchial tree can cause respiratory obstruction and is potentially fatal.  Angioedema of the gastrointestinal tract manifests with abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. $Normally, #C1 esterase inhibitor# suppresses activation of the C1 complement component and therefore the rest of the classic complement pathway.  It also inactivates #kallikrein#, which catalyzes the conversion of kininogen to bradykinin.  In #hereditary# angioedema, low C1 esterase inhibitor activity leads to an increase in active kallikrein and bradykinin levels.  #Bradykinin #(along with C3a and C5a) mediate angioedema by increasing vasodilation and vascular permeability. $Angioedema may also occur as a side effect of #angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor# medications.  ACE normally catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I into angiotensin II.  ACE also converts bradykinin into inactive metabolites.  ACE inhibitors can therefore lead to #bradykinin accumulation#.  These medications should #not# be used in patients with hereditary angioedema as they may precipitate disease episodes. $#(Choice B)#  Furosemide can cause hypokalemia, hyperuricemia, and hypovolemia.  Ototoxicity may occur if furosemide is used with aminoglycosides. $#(Choice C)#  Methotrexate can cause hepatitis, pulmonary fibrosis, and bone marrow suppression. $#(Choice D)#  Metoprolol is a selective β1-adrenergic blocker with few side effects.  It may cause heart block in patients with conduction system disease and bronchoconstriction in asthmatic patients (rare due to β1 selectivity but can still occur). $#(Choice E)#  The most common side effect of penicillin is hypersensitivity. $#Educational objective# Angioedema can be hereditary (autosomal dominant) or acquired (associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitor treatment).  In hereditary angioedema, low C1 esterase inhibitor activity leads to increases in bradykinin activity.  ACE inhibitors should not be used in these patients.  "

  "explanation_2": "#Asthma# is a complex disease involving both chronic inflammation and airway hyperreactivity.  #Inhaled corticosteroids# (eg, fluticasone, budesonide) are a mainstay of asthma therapy.  Corticosteroids reduce inflammation by inhibiting nuclear transcription of inflammatory genes (in part leading to downregulation of the enzyme @phospholipase A2@) to decrease the production of leukotrienes and other inflammatory mediators. $Although corticosteroids have no direct effect on bronchodilation, these drugs provide an additional benefit in asthma by #potentiating the bronchodilatory effect# of beta-2 agonists (eg, albuterol).  This is accomplished by stimulating the #upregulation of beta-2 receptors# in #bronchial smooth muscle#, increasing cellular responsiveness to adrenergic stimulus.  This medication effect is similar to the permissive effect of endogenous cortisol on blood pressure, which involves upregulation of alpha-1 receptors and increased responsiveness of vascular smooth muscle cells to epinephrine. $#(Choice A)#  Corticosteroids increase, rather than decrease, the production of lung surfactants and may be used to help prevent infant respiratory distress syndrome in premature infants. $#(Choice B)#  Guaifenesin reduces the viscosity (ie, thickness) of respiratory tract mucus and is often used in the symptomatic management of viral upper respiratory tract infections.  Decreased mucus viscosity is not a direct effect of corticosteroids. $#(Choice C)#  Theophylline provides benefit in asthma by stimulating bronchodilation via inhibition of phosphodiesterase-3 and may also create an anti-inflammatory effect via inhibition of phosphodiesterase-4.  Corticosteroids may somewhat decrease phosphodiesterase activity but likely do not have a significant effect. $#(Choice D)#  Omalizumab is a monoclonal antibody that treats asthma by binding to free IgE to decrease IgE binding to surface receptors on mast cells and basophils.  This inhibits the degranulation of inflammatory mediators.  The anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroids may also contribute to a decrease, rather than an increase, in surface-bound IgE. $#Educational objective# Corticosteroids (eg, fluticasone, budesonide) have multiple beneficial effects in the treatment of asthma.  In addition to their anti-inflammatory effect, corticosteroids upregulate beta-2 receptors on bronchial smooth muscle to increase cellular responsiveness to adrenergic stimuli and potentiate the bronchodilatory response to inhaled beta-2 agonists (eg, albuterol).

Empyema is an advanced form of complicated parapneumonic effusion in which bacterial invasion into the pleural space is followed by progressive inflammation with #pus accumulation# and #organized fibrosis#.  Treatment requires prompt drainage of the infected fluid via a chest tube, but such effusions are often difficult to drain due to numerous loculations (ie, separated fluid pockets) and high fluid viscosity. $In some cases, intrapleural administration of a #fibrinolytic agent# (eg, tissue plasminogen activator [tPA], streptokinase) in combination with deoxyribonuclease (DNase) can #improve drainage# of a loculated empyema and help resolve the effusion via chest tube drainage.  The tPA #activates fibrin-bound plasminogen# to @break down@ organized fibrin, and the DNase enzyme may assist by cleaving nucleic acids that increase fluid viscosity after being deposited by lysed leukocytes (eg, neutrophil extracellular traps). $A complicated parapneumonic effusion or empyema that cannot be successfully drained following the administration of tPA and DNase typically requires surgical drainage via video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. $#(Choice B)#  Interstitial edema formation occurs early in the development of pleural effusion, causing increased fluid to pass into the pleural space.

However, none of these medications target fibrin (the major contributor to development of loculated empyema), and they are therefore not helpful in the management of empyema. $#(Choice E)#  Pleurodesis involves the instillation of a chemical irritant (eg, talc) into the pleural space to fuse the visceral and parietal pleural layers together.

A peripheral nerve is stimulated 4 times in quick succession and the muscular response is recorded.  The height of each bar represents the strength of each twitch; higher bars indicate the activation of increasing numbers of individual muscle fibers (myocytes). $When a #nondepolarizing NMJ blocker# (eg, vecuronium) is administered, competitive inhibition of postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors at the motor endplate prevents some of these fibers from activating, decreasing the strength of the twitch.  TOF stimulation shows a #progressive reduction# in each of the 4 responses (fading pattern) as a result of less acetylcholine being released with each subsequent impulse (due to the additional effect of presynaptic acetylcholine receptor blockade).  In contrast, #depolarizing blockers# (eg, #succinylcholine#) initially function by preventing repolarization of the motor endplate and show #equal reduction# of all 4 twitches during TOF stimulation #(phase I blockade)#.  The responses remain equal because the presynaptic acetylcholine receptor stimulation helps to mobilize presynaptic acetylcholine vesicles for release.  Persistent exposure to succinylcholine results in eventual transition to #phase II blockade# as the acetylcholine receptors become desensitized and inactivated (ie, functionally similar to nondepolarizing blockade). $Succinylcholine is commonly administered for #rapid-sequence intubation# due to its rapid onset (<1 minute).  The duration of action is determined by its metabolism by plasma cholinesterase and is typically <10 minutes.  However, some patients are homozygous for an atypical plasma cholinesterase, which breaks down succinylcholine more slowly.  In these patients, the paralysis can last for #hours# and they must be maintained on mechanical ventilation until spontaneous respirations resume. $#(Choice A)#  Dantrolene relaxes skeletal muscle by reducing the release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.  Dantrolene is used to treat malignant hyperthermia and neuroleptic malignant syndrome.  It is not routinely used as a neuromuscular paralytic agent. $#(Choice B)#  Benzodiazepines are effective for sedation, but they have no direct action at the NMJ and do not provide sufficient muscle paralysis to facilitate intubation. $#(Choices C and E)#  Pancuronium and tubocurarine are nondepolarizing NMJ blockers.  Unlike depolarizing NMJ drugs, these agents do not function in distinct phases and their TOF responses always display a fading pattern.  Neostigmine administration reverses nondepolarizing NMJ blockade. $#Educational objective# Succinylcholine is a fast-acting, depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent used for rapid-sequence intubation that causes equal reduction of all 4 twitches during train-of-four stimulation (phase I blockade).  Prolonged administration of succinylcholine or use in patients with abnormal plasma cholinesterase activity causes transition to a phase II (nondepolarizing) block, seen as a progressive reduction in each of the 4 twitches.

Persistent inflammation likely triggers excessive activity of growth factors normally involved in wound healing, including transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), fibroblastic growth factor (FGF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).  This leads to increased fibroblast activity, myofibroblast formation, and collagen production, which contribute to pulmonary fibrosis.  #Pirfenidone# is an antifibrotic agent that #inhibits TGF-β#; another treatment option is nintedanib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits PDGF, FGF, and VEGF.  Although neither drug is curative, these therapies have been shown to slow progressive fibrosis in patients with IPF. $#(Choice A)#  Alpha-1 antitrypsin infusion is used to treat patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, which causes panacinar emphysema and typically presents in young patients with dyspnea and cough.

  "explanation_2": "#Dextromethorphan# (DXM) is a popular #cough suppressant# (antitussive agent) that is readily available over the counter.  Its primary mechanism of action is inhibition of the medullary cough center through #sigma (σ) receptor activation#.  Although structurally very closely related to other opioid morphinans (eg, codeine, morphine), DXM has trivial mu (μ) and delta (δ) opioid receptor affinity.  Therefore, #classic opioid adverse effects# (eg, constipation, respiratory depression, analgesia, sedation) are #not seen# at therapeutic doses.  This favorable pharmacologic profile makes DXM a first-choice agent for cough suppression. $However, DXM also increases serotonin activity in the CNS by decreasing the rate of presynaptic serotonin reuptake and directly stimulating serotonin receptors.  For this reason, DXM abuse can cause #serotonin syndrome#, manifesting as muscular hypertonia, spasticity (eg, clonus, hyperreflexia), autonomic instability (eg, hyperthermia, hypertension), and encephalopathy.  This potentially fatal condition most often occurs in settings of overdose or accidental @drug interaction@ with other serotonergic drugs (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, triptans, monoamine oxidase inhibitors). $#(Choice A)#  Although DXM has the potential for abuse, addiction is less likely than with opioid cough suppressants (eg, codeine).  Recreational drug use typically begins in peer settings, and adolescents and young adults are at greatest risk; this 39-year-old woman has no history of recreational drug use and is likely at low risk. $#(Choice C)#  DXM has no intrinsic hepatotoxicity.  However, acute liver injury can occur in overdose scenarios involving combination dextromethorphan-acetaminophen preparations (eg, multi-symptom cold remedies). $#(Choice D)#  Although it has negligible μ receptor agonism at therapeutic doses, DXM at high doses may cause intoxication that can occasionally elicit enough μ receptor agonism to produce hypoventilation and stupor.  These symptoms can be reversed with naloxone. $#(Choice E)#  Patients who use over-the-counter decongestants (eg, oxymetazoline or phenylephrine sprays, oral pseudoephedrine) for prolonged periods can develop rhinitis medicamentosa, characterized by rebound nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and turbinate hypertrophy.  However, rebound cough is not observed on DXM withdrawal. $#Educational objective# Dextromethorphan (DXM) is a popular over-the-counter antitussive agent that acts on sigma receptors to suppress the medullary cough center.  DXM also has an off-target action on serotonin transports and receptors in the CNS.  Overdose or accidental interaction with other serotonergic medications (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, antidepressants) can precipitate serotonin syndrome.  ",

Three medications are commonly used because of their rapid onset of action and short duration of effect. $• #Propofol:# A highly lipophilic GABA agonist that may be used for #long-term sedation#.  Disadvantages include vasodilation, which can result in #hypotension# and an increase in serum triglycerides and lipase. $• #Etomidate:# A GABA agonist that has the advantage of being the most #hemodynamically neutral#.  It does not cause changes in heart rate, blood pressure, or cardiac output.  However, it inhibits cortisol synthesis, which can lead to (reversible) #adrenocortical suppression#.

In contrast to propofol and etomidate, it also provides an analgesic effect.  Ketamine stimulates the release of catecholamines (ie, #sympathomimetic#), which can cause #bronchodilation# but also increase the heart rate, myocardial contractility, and cerebral blood flow, potentially putting the patient at risk for cardiovascular events or increased intracranial pressure. $In this patient with an acute asthma attack, #ketamine #was likely chosen because it stimulates release of catecholamines that increase sympathomimetic activity and may #improve bronchospasm#. $#(Choice A)#  Propofol and etomidate are both GABA agonists, but ketamine works at the NMDA receptor. $#(Choice B)#  Both ketamine and etomidate are much less lipophilic than propofol. $#(Choice C)#  Both ketamine and etomidate are metabolized primarily by the liver.  Propofol is also metabolized by the liver, but the effect is terminated by its redistribution rather than metabolism. $#(Choice D)#  Neuromuscular blockade is often used to facilitate intubation.  None of the three commonly used induction anesthetics cause significant neuromuscular blockade, so an additional medication (eg, succinylcholine, rocuronium) is used if needed. $#Educational objective# Ketamine can be used for anesthesia induction.

  "explanation_2": "$Quitting smoking cigarettes is difficult due to nicotine content and its activation of reward pathways in the brain.  The reinforcing effects of nicotine that lead to dependence are thought to be caused by stimulation of the alpha-4 beta-2# nicotinic acetylcholine receptor# present in the CNS.  #Varenicline# is a #partial agonist# of this receptor that competes with nicotine (a full agonist) and prevents it from binding to the receptor. $Because varenicline is a partial agonist, it helps #reduce# the symptoms of #nicotine withdrawal# by mildly stimulating the receptor.  However, because varenicline is not a full agonist, downstream release of dopamine is modest, resulting in #less stimulation of reward pathways# than nicotine. $#(Choices A and B)#  Benzodiazepines (eg, clonazepam) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (eg, fluoxetine) have not been shown to be effective for smoking cessation. $#(Choice C)#  Nicotine patches slowly release nicotine, thus preventing withdrawal symptoms when the patient stops using cigarettes.  However, because nicotine is a full agonist (and does not partially block the receptor like varenicline does), patches do not prevent the pleasurable effects of additional nicotine received by smoking cigarettes. $#(Choice D)#  Topiramate is an anticonvulsant used to treat epilepsy, and it is also effective for migraine prophylaxis.  Several studies have tested the effectiveness of topiramate for smoking cessation; however, the current evidence shows little or no significant difference in long-term tobacco abstinence over placebo. $#Educational objective# Varenicline is a partial agonist of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.  It can help patients stop using tobacco by reducing withdrawal symptoms and attenuating the rewarding effects of nicotine.  "

This patient's family history is suggestive of the familial form of PAH, which is most often caused by inactivating mutations involving the proapoptotic BMPR2 gene.  The resulting increase in endothelial and smooth muscle cell proliferation leads to vascular remodeling, elevated pulmonary vascular resistance, and progressively elevated pulmonary arterial pressure. $Although lung transplantation is the definitive treatment for PAH, medical therapy targeting the effects of endothelial dysfunction can help improve symptoms.  #Bosentan# is an #endothelin-receptor antagonist# that blocks the effects of endothelin (a potent vasoconstrictor that also stimulates endothelial proliferation).

Neither of these agents has anti-inflammatory properties, and although short-acting beta agonists are widely used to provide rapid relief of symptoms during an exacerbation, they do not prevent inflammation-induced airway remodeling or alter the chronic disease course. $#(Choice D)#  Magnesium sulfate inhibits calcium influx into airway smooth muscle and promotes bronchodilation when given intravenously during an acute asthma flare-up.  Magnesium also reduces inflammation by stabilizing T cells and inhibiting mast cell degranulation; however, it is less effective than corticosteroids. $#(Choice E)#  Leukotrienes are potent inducers of airway bronchoconstriction and inflammation.  Leukotriene inhibitors (eg, montelukast) are useful for long-term control in some patients with asthma.  However, they possess less efficacy and have fewer anti-inflammatory properties than inhaled glucocorticoids. $#(Choice F)#  Theophylline, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, results in increased intracellular cyclic AMP, which contributes to its role as a bronchodilator.  Theophylline also has anti-inflammatory effects, although they are far less potent than glucocorticoids. $#Educational objective# Asthma is characterized by chronic airway inflammation, which leads to airway remodeling, airway hyperresponsiveness, and bronchoconstriction.

Etanercept is a fusion protein with domains derived from the Fc portion of IgG1 and TNF receptor 2.  It functions as a #decoy receptor# for TNF-α.  Other TNF-α inhibitors are anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies (eg, infliximab, adalimumab). $Inhibition of TNF-α leads to impaired cell-mediated immunity.  In particular, TNF-α is necessary for effective sequestration of mycobacteria within granulomas.  As a result, TNF-α inhibitors promote reactivation of latent tuberculosis and can increase the risk of disseminated disease.  All patients being considered for TNF-α inhibitor therapy should have a baseline tuberculin skin test or interferon-gamma release assay to screen for latent tuberculosis.  TNF-α inhibitors also increase susceptibility to other infectious agents, including fungi and atypical mycobacteria, and should not be used in any patient with an underlying infection. $#(Choice A)#  CT is effective in diagnosing a variety of infections of the central nervous system, including disseminated tuberculosis.  However, a baseline CT scan is not needed in rheumatoid arthritis in the absence of suspicious symptoms. $#(Choice B)#  Baseline assessment of left ventricular function with echocardiogram or radionuclide ventriculography is recommended prior to treatment with anthracycline antineoplastic drugs (eg, doxorubicin). $#(Choice C)#  Patients taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are at increased risk for peptic ulcer.  Fecal occult blood testing should be performed in patients taking NSAIDs whenever there is a clinical suspicion of gastrointestinal bleeding. $#(Choice D)#  Pulmonary function tests may be important in patients taking medications known to cause pulmonary fibrosis, such as amiodarone.  Methotrexate can cause both lung and liver toxicity, and a baseline chest x-ray and liver function tests are recommended. $#(Choice F)#  Irreversible retinal damage can occur with long-term use of hydroxychloroquine.  Patients starting hydroxychloroquine should have baseline and regular follow-up ophthalmologic examinations. $#Educational objective# Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors impair cell-mediated immunity.

Its most significant toxicity is irreversible retinopathy, and patients should have regular ophthalmologic examinations. $#(Choice C)#  Minocycline is a tetracycline antibiotic with weak antirheumatic activity.  Common side effects include photosensitivity dermatitis. $#(Choice D)#  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs [eg, naproxen]) are used for initial symptom relief in RA, although they do not prevent the long-term joint damage caused by the disease.  Significant side effects include gastritis/gastric ulcers and acute kidney injury. $#(Choice E)#  Glucocorticoids are used for initial treatment and acute flares of RA.  Short-term side effects include insomnia and hyperglycemia.  Long-term side effects are significant and include weight gain, osteoporosis, and muscle weakness; these drugs also potentiate the risk of gastric ulcers in patients taking NSAIDs. $#Educational objective# Methotrexate is the preferred disease-modifying treatment for patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis.  Significant adverse effects include stomatitis, bone marrow suppression, and liver function abnormalities.  ",

The presence of #antihistone antibodies# suggests #drug-induced lupus erythematosus# (DILE). $Unlike patients with classic lupus erythematosus, patients with DILE usually have no cutaneous (eg, malar rash), renal (eg, glomerulonephritis), or neurologic complications; in addition, laboratory evaluation usually shows no anti–double stranded DNA antibodies.  Most cases of DILE improve rapidly when the inciting agent is discontinued. $The drug that triggered DILE in this patient was likely #isoniazid# (a common component of multidrug therapy for TB), which is metabolized via phase II acetylation in the liver.  Hepatic expression of N-acetyltransferase is genetically determined, and patients with a #slow acetylator# phenotype are at #greatest risk for DILE#.  These patients are also predisposed to isoniazid-induced peripheral neuropathy due to retention of the drug over time, leading to elevated drug levels.  Procainamide and hydralazine are also metabolized via acetylation in the liver; therefore, patients with slow acetylator phenotype can also develop DILE from these medications. $#(Choice B)#  Liver hydrolysis is a phase I reaction in which a compound is cleaved by adding water (eg, esterase, amidase enzymes).  Phase I metabolism usually precedes phase II conjugation metabolism. $#(Choice C)#  Liver hydroxylation is a phase I oxidation transformation catalyzed by the cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase system.  The addition of a hydroxyl group reduces lipid solubility and facilitates excretion. $#(Choice D)#  Liver sulfate conjugation is a phase II metabolic pathway that biotransforms drugs into more polar compounds that are more water soluble and easily excreted. $#(Choice E)#  Certain drugs are hydrolyzed by plasma esterases, which rapidly cleave ester linkages after the drug enters the circulation.  This rapid inactivation allows for the short duration of action of these medications.  Many drugs used in anesthesia (eg, succinylcholine, tetracaine, remifentanil) are metabolized by plasma hydrolysis. $#(Choice F)#  A few drugs are not metabolized in the body.  They are excreted, mostly unchanged, in the urine and are still pharmacologically active. $#Educational objective# Drug-induced lupus erythematosus (DILE) is characterized by abrupt-onset lupus symptoms (eg, fever, arthralgia, pleuritis) with positive antihistone antibodies.  It has been linked to drugs metabolized by N-acetylation in the liver (eg, procainamide, hydralazine, isoniazid).

The usual first-line treatment of acute gouty arthritis is nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (eg, indomethacin), but these are relatively contraindicated in patients with a history of peptic ulcer.  #Colchicine# can also be used to treat acute gouty arthritis and results in resolution of symptoms in most patients. $Colchicine works primarily by inhibiting #microtubular polymerization#.  It binds to the tubulin protein that helps form microtubules, preventing their aggregation.  This in turn disrupts cytoskeletal-dependent functions such as #chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and degranulation#.  Colchicine also reduces the formation of leukotriene B4.  It does not have any effect on the metabolism or urinary excretion of uric acid.  Important adverse effects of colchicine are nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea.  Colchicine should not be used in elderly patients or those with severe renal dysfunction. $#(Choices A and E)#  Glucocorticoids inhibit the enzyme phospholipase A2, which converts membrane phospholipids to arachidonic acid.  This in turn decreases the formation of inflammatory prostaglandins and leukotrienes.  Glucocorticoids can be given systemically or by intra-articular injection for treatment of gout in patients who cannot take NSAIDs or colchicine. $#(Choices B and D)#  The @leukotriene pathways@ can be blocked by inhibiting the 5-lipoxygenase pathway or by blocking the leukotriene receptors.  Zileuton is a specific inhibitor of the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase and inhibits leukotriene formation (LTB4, LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4).  Montelukast inhibits LTD4 receptors.  Leukotriene modifiers are used in the treatment of asthma and allergic rhinitis but have no role in the treatment of gout. $#(Choice C)#  Cyclooxygenase (COX) catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostanoids.  It exists in 2 isoforms, COX-1 and COX-2.  COX-2 is an inducible enzyme that is upregulated in inflammatory cells to increase synthesis of pro-inflammatory arachidonic acid metabolites.  Standard NSAIDs (eg, indomethacin, ibuprofen) inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2, while selective COX-2 inhibitors (eg, celecoxib) inhibit only COX-2. $#Educational objective# Colchicine is used for treatment of acute gouty arthritis in patients who cannot take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

  "explanation_2": "Acute onset of pain and swelling of the first metatarsophalangeal joint and joint aspiration showing needle-shaped, negatively birefringent crystals are diagnostic for acute gouty arthritis.  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the mainstay of treatment for most patients.  However, colchicine is often used in patients with mild-to-moderate renal failure, peptic ulcer disease, or other contraindications to NSAIDs.  Colchicine is an effective anti-inflammatory agent in acute gouty arthritis and acts by binding to the intracellular protein tubulin, preventing tubulin polymerization into microtubules.  This leads to impaired leukocyte migration and phagocytosis, reducing the inflammation seen in gouty arthritis.  Because colchicine also disrupts microtubule formation in gastrointestinal mucosal cells, many patients develop diarrhea and, less commonly, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. $#(Choices A and E)#  Probenecid decreases proximal tubular uric acid reabsorption, and allopurinol inhibits xanthine oxidase (converts xanthine to uric acid).  These medications are prescribed to lower serum uric acid levels in chronic gout.  These agents are contraindicated in acute gouty arthritis as they can mobilize tissue stores of uric acid and precipitate or worsen acute attacks. $#(Choice B)#  NSAIDs induce their anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 isoenzymes, thus blocking prostaglandin synthesis.  Because they can cause significant gastrointestinal irritation (eg, nausea, dyspepsia, bleeding), their use is contraindicated in patients with peptic ulcer disease. $#(Choice D)#  Glucocorticosteroids exert their anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting phospholipase A2 activity.  These medications can be used in acute gout and are not associated with significant diarrhea. $#Educational objective# Colchicine is a second-line agent for treating acute gouty arthritis.  It inhibits tubulin polymerization and microtubule formation in leukocytes, reducing neutrophil chemotaxis and emigration to sites inflamed by tissue deposition of monosodium urate crystals.  Gastrointestinal mucosal function is also impaired by microtubule disruption, leading to diarrhea and, less commonly, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.  "

Opioids are derived from the opium poppy plant and act on multiple receptor types (eg, @mu, kappa, delta@) located throughout the brain, spinal cord, and gastrointestinal tract.  In an overdose, overstimulation of these receptors causes numerous adverse effects, the most lethal one being respiratory depression.  Respiratory depression is the best predictor of opioid intoxication. $In addition to the classic triad, other clinical manifestations of opioid intoxication include the following: $• #Hypothermia:#  Opioid receptors play a role in thermoregulation, and their activation can impair thermogenesis.  In addition, intoxicated patients are often obtunded and are incapable of protecting themselves from exposure to the environment, leading to heat loss. $• #Hypotension# (usually mild):  Opioids induce histamine release from mast cells.  Histamine binding to H1 receptors on vascular endothelial cells results in arterial vasodilation. $• #Decreased tidal volume:#  Opioid binding at receptors in the brainstem respiratory center causes depression of ventilation as well as inhibition of the protective ventilatory response to hypercapnia and hypoxia.  This overall depressed ventilatory drive results in both reduced respiratory rate and decreased tidal volume. $Decreased bowels sounds and constipation are also common, as opioids slow gastric emptying and decrease peristalsis. $#Educational objective# The classic triad of opioid intoxication is decreased respiratory rate, pupillary constriction (ie, miosis), and depressed mental status.  Hypothermia, hypotension, and decreased tidal volume are also common findings.  ",

Nitroprusside is a vasodilator with quick onset/offset kinetics commonly used for rapid blood pressure control in patients with hypertensive emergency.  Nitroprusside [Na2(#CN#)5#NO#] rapidly decomposes to nitric oxide (#NO#: vasodilator) and cyanide ion (#CN−#: toxin).  Key risk factors for nitroprusside-induced cyanide toxicity include high doses, prolonged infusions, and #renal insufficiency# (eg, acute kidney injury due to hypertensive emergency). $Cyanide is a potent mitochondrial toxin that binds heme centers in cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV), blocking the @electron transport chain@.  Because mitochondria are #unable to reduce oxygen#, venous blood returning from tissues remains saturated with oxygen and appears #bright red#.  Loss of aerobic respiration also promotes #lactic acidosis#.  As ATP is depleted, acute cyanide toxicity causes neurologic dysfunction (eg, altered mental status, seizures) and cardiovascular collapse. $Cyanide is cleared by rhodanese, an enzyme that transfers sulfur to cyanide to form thiocyanate (SCN) for excretion in urine.  Because cyanide overdose depletes available sulfur donors, one approach to @treatment@ is to provide additional sulfur groups with #sodium thiosulfate#.  Other treatments include #hydroxocobalamin# (directly sequesters CN−) and #sodium nitrite# (induces methemoglobinemia to scavenge CN−). $#(Choice A)#  Methemoglobinemia, caused by oxidizing agents (eg, nitrites, chloroquine), and carbon monoxide exposure increase hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen, which impairs oxygen unloading into the tissues.  Both processes disrupt peripheral tissue oxygen delivery, leading to lactic acidosis. $#(Choice B)#  Arsenic inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase, the rate-limiting enzyme governing conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA for entry into the tricarboxylic acid cycle, causing depletion of ATP.  Acute arsenic poisoning presents with severe enteritis (diarrhea) and neurologic dysfunction. $#(Choice C)#  Ethanol is converted to acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase, with concurrent reduction of NAD+ to NADH.  High NADH levels subsequently cause feedback inhibition of lactate dehydrogenase (hepatic gluconeogenesis enzyme), leading to hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis. $#(Choice E)#  Electron transport uncouplers (eg, dinitrophenol [DNP]) cause protons to back-leak across the inner mitochondrial membrane, dissipating the gradient as wasted heat instead of generating ATP.  Because they raise the metabolic rate, these agents are occasionally abused as catabolic weight loss agents.  Accidental overdose results in fatal hyperthermia. $#Educational objective# Cyanide toxicity is an important adverse effect of nitroprusside.  Blockage of mitochondrial electron transport leads to impaired oxygen utilization, causing lactic acidosis, neurologic dysfunction, and cardiovascular collapse.  ",

Although methemoglobinemia is most commonly caused by dapsone, the most severe cases are seen after administration of benzocaine, which is found in many throat sprays or teething-relief medications. $Acquired methemoglobinemia occurs when heme #iron atoms# are #oxidized #from the ferrous (Fe2+) to the ferric (#Fe3+#) state.

In addition, this patient does not have exposure risk factors for carbon monoxide (eg, house fire, car exhaust). $#(Choice C)#  Opioid pain medications and benzodiazepine anxiolytics can lead to a decreased central respiratory drive that, if severe, can lead to hypoxia.

Most cases of cholinergic toxicity are due to #organophosphate# pesticides.  However, the occurrence in multiple patients in a city setting suggests intentional organophosphate exposure, possibly due to a chemical weapon (eg, sarin, soman). $Organophosphates #inhibit acetylcholinesterase# in the muscarinic and nicotinic cholinergic synapses, leading to decreased acetylcholine degradation and overstimulation of the corresponding receptors.  In addition to widespread increased visceral smooth muscle tone and glandular secretions due to muscarinic hyperactivity (mnemonic: DUMBELS), #nicotinic hyperactivity# causes #muscle weakness# and paralysis that can lead to rapid respiratory depression and death. $Initial management of organophosphate toxicity includes atropine, a competitive inhibitor of acetylcholine at the muscarinic receptor, which relieves muscarinic hyperstimulation.  However, atropine does not have activity at the nicotinic receptors and cannot treat neuromuscular dysfunction.  Therefore, #pralidoxime#, a #cholinesterase-reactivating agent# that works at both nicotinic and muscarinic sites, should be administered to any patient with neuromuscular dysfunction (eg, weakness, fasciculations).  It should be given only #after atropine# because pralidoxime can cause transient acetylcholinesterase inhibition, which can momentarily worsen symptoms. $#(Choice A)#  Diphenhydramine is an inverse agonist of the histamine H1 receptor, which allows it to function as an antihistamine.  Because the H1 receptor is similar to the muscarinic receptor, diphenhydramine has some antimuscarinic effects (eg, urinary retention).  However, it is less potent than atropine, and it would not reverse nicotinic dysfunction (weakness). $#(Choice B)#  Hemodialysis is sometimes used to treat toxic alcohol poisoning, which usually presents with altered mental status, as well as vision changes (methanol) or flank pain and hematuria (ethylene glycol).  It is not indicated in cholinergic toxicity. $#(Choice C)#  Hyperbaric oxygen is used to treat severe carbon monoxide poisoning, which presents with nausea, dizziness, and altered mental status.

  "explanation_2": "This patient with blurred vision, fever, altered mental status, flushed skin, and dry mucous membranes has #anticholinergic toxicity#, likely from encountering jimsonweed (Datura stramonium) while working in his yard.  Jimsonweed contains large concentrations of the anticholinergic compounds #atropine#, #scopolamine#, and hyoscyamine.  These agents competitively inhibit acetylcholine at the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, leading to the classic toxidrome summarized above.  Anticholinergic toxicity can be counteracted by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft.  #Physostigmine#, a cholinesterase inhibitor, increases acetylcholine levels by preventing its degradation by cholinesterase. $#(Choice A)#  Organophosphates are cholinesterase inhibitors that are commonly used as pesticides.  Atropine can be used to counteract the effects of excess muscarinic stimulation (eg, increased salivation, miosis, bronchospasm, bradycardia). However, patients remain at risk of paralysis due to nicotinic overactivation, and so also require treatment with pralidoxime, a cholinesterase reactivating agent. $#(Choices B and D)#  Benztropine is a centrally acting anticholinergic medication used for the treatment of idiopathic and drug-induced Parkinson disease.  Haloperidol is a neuroleptic drug that blocks dopamine receptors in the central nervous system and is used to treat psychosis.  These drugs have anticholinergic effects that would worsen this patient's symptoms. $#(Choice C)#  Diazepam, a long-acting benzodiazepine, positively modulates GABAA action by increasing the frequency of chloride channel opening.  It is used to treat seizures associated with atropine poisoning but does not affect muscarinic cholinergic receptors. $#(Choice E)#  Metoprolol is a selective β1-adrenergic receptor antagonist.  It is used to treat angina, acute coronary syndromes, heart failure, hypertension, and arrhythmias. $#(Choices F and G)#  Morphine is an opioid pain medication that exerts its effects by stimulating opioid receptors in the brain.  Naloxone is a competitive antagonist of these receptors used for opioid overdose.  Morphine has some anticholinergic effects and may worsen symptoms whereas naloxone does not affect cholinergic receptors. $#(Choice I)#  Thiamine (B1) is a cofactor for multiple enzymes used in glucose metabolism.  Patients who are chronically deficient (eg, due to alcohol use disorder or malnutrition) can develop Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, confusion). $#Educational objective# Anticholinergic agents (eg, atropine, scopolamine) competitively inhibit acetylcholine at the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor.  The effects can be memorized with the mnemonic, \"Blind as a bat, mad as a hatter, red as a beet, hot as a hare, dry as a bone, full as a flask, and fast as a fiddle,\" and can be reversed by cholinesterase inhibitors (physostigmine).

  "explanation_2": "$Metabolism of #acetaminophen# occurs in the liver and involves several enzymatic pathways.  Most of the drug (~90%) undergoes sulfation and glucuronidation into nontoxic metabolites prior to elimination through the urine; a small amount (~2%) of acetaminophen is directly excreted by the kidneys.  The remaining acetaminophen is metabolized by hepatic #cytochrome P450# into the #toxic metabolite# N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (#NAPQI#). $With an appropriate dose of acetaminophen, the small amount of NAPQI produced is converted to a nontoxic form via conjugation by hepatic glutathione and is then excreted in the urine.  However, with an acetaminophen #overdose#, the liver sulfation and glucuronidation pathways become overwhelmed, resulting in excessive NAPQI formation.  Once #intrahepatic glutathione# stores are #depleted#, the unconjugated NAPQI level rises and causes oxidative damage to the liver. $Management of acetaminophen overdose includes #N-acetylcysteine# (NAC), which provides the liver a precursor to produce more glutathione.  By #increasing intrahepatic glutathione stores#, NAC facilitates NAPQI detoxification and prevents further hepatotoxicity. $#(Choice A)#  Although hepatic glucuronidation is an important step in the metabolism of acetaminophen, NAC works by replenishing glutathione stores, not by activating glucuronidation enzymes. $#(Choice B)#  Opioids exert toxicity by overstimulating their receptors, which can be reversed by competitive inhibition (ie, naloxone).  NAPQI does not bind a specific receptor.  Instead, it generates reactive oxygen species and forms adducts with hepatic proteins. $#(Choice D)#  Management of some drug overdoses (eg, salicylates such as aspirin) includes urine alkalinization (ie, sodium bicarbonate), which can increase urinary excretion of the toxin.  Urine alkalinization is not helpful for acetaminophen overdose because unconjugated NAPQI is not excreted through the urine. $#(Choice E)#  Cimetidine inhibits cytochrome P450, which can decrease acetaminophen metabolism, but it has not been shown to be effective in acetaminophen overdose. $#Educational objective# Acetaminophen overdose overwhelms normal metabolic pathways in the liver and depletes intrahepatic glutathione stores, leading to excessive production of N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), a toxic metabolite.

Although the parent alcohols are relatively nontoxic, ethylene glycol and methanol exhibit profoundly toxic effects when metabolized: $• #Ethylene glycol# metabolites (eg, oxalic acid, glycolic acid, glyoxylic acid) cause #acute kidney injury# due to cytotoxicity and crystalline obstruction. $• #Methanol# metabolites (eg, formic acid) cause retinal injury that leads to #blindness#. $#Fomepizole#, a #competitive inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase#, is the preferred agent for treatment of ethylene glycol and methanol toxicity.

It is used for a variety of poisonings (eg, phenobarbital, acetaminophen); however, it does not absorb alcohol. $#(Choice E)#  N-acetylcysteine restores hepatic glutathione stores, promoting the enzyme-based detoxification of the toxic acetaminophen metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI).  Acetaminophen toxicity presents with altered mentation and AGMA; however, an elevated osmolar gap is unexpected and patients often develop signs of hepatic failure (eg, jaundice). $#Educational objective# Ethylene glycol and methanol are toxic alcohols that cause anion gap metabolic acidosis and an elevated osmolar gap.  Toxicity occurs after metabolization by alcohol dehydrogenase; fomepizole is a competitive inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase and is used for the treatment of acute poisoning.  ",

The body typically compensates for hypotension by becoming tachycardic.  It is unusual to see both bradycardia and hypotension simultaneously, and #medication overdose# should be suspected in these cases. $Although several medications can cause hypotension and bradycardia, this patient's #wheezing# suggests #bronchospasm# and makes #beta blocker toxicity# most likely.  Beta-1 receptors are located primarily in the heart, whereas #beta-2 receptors# are located on the smooth muscle of the lung #bronchioles# and skeletal muscle arterioles, as well as on hepatocytes.  When activated by catecholamines, beta-1 receptors cause increased heart rate and cardiac contractility and beta-2 receptors cause smooth muscle relaxation with bronchodilation.  Beta-2 receptor activation also stimulates hepatocellular gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis to increase blood glucose. $Beta blockers are commonly used to treat high blood pressure and arrhythmias, and often target both beta-1 and beta-2 receptors.  Because beta blockers act as #competitive antagonists for endogenous catecholam#i#nes#, beta blocker toxicity prevents the catecholamine-mediated effects on the heart, lungs, and liver, causing hypotension, bradycardia, bronchospasm, and #hypoglycemia#.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient most likely has #atopic dermatitis# (eczema), an #inflammatory# condition that begins in infancy or early childhood.  Pathogenesis involves genetically mediated skin barrier dysfunction (eg, filaggrin mutation) and a dysregulated immune response that favors IgE production, mast cell and eosinophil activation, and overproduction of Th2 cytokines. $Loss of epidermal water content, increased permeability to allergens/irritants, and inflammation result in dry skin, intense pruritus, erythema, and, sometimes, weeping and crusting (as seen in this patient).  Distribution typically includes the face and the flexural areas of the @elbows@ and knees in children. $First-line treatment of atopic dermatitis is topical corticosteroids.  However, due to concerns for corticosteroid-induced atrophy in areas with thin skin (eg, face, neck, axilla, groin), second-line therapy with #calcineurin inhibitors# (eg, tacrolimus, pimecrolimus) can be used instead.  Through the inhibition of calcineurin, a lymphocyte-specific phosphatase, these medications #inhibit T-cell signaling# that would normally lead to #transcription# of the proinflammatory cytokine #IL-2#.  Reduced IL-2 leads to #decreased T-cell activation# and #proliferation#, and, in turn, inflammation. $#(Choices A and C)#  Cromolyn is a mast cell stabilizer that inhibits @histamine granule release@ from mast cells and can be used to treat allergic rhinitis or systemic mastocytosis.  Omalizumab, a monoclonal anti-IgE antibody, prevents binding of IgE to mast cells and basophils and is most commonly used to treat persistent, severe asthma. $#(Choice D)#  IL-4 stimulates IgE production and the differentiation of naïve CD4 T cells to Th2 cells, which exacerbate the inflammatory response in atopic dermatitis.  Dupilumab is a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits IL-4 action by antagonizing the IL-4 receptor.  It can be considered for severe atopic dermatitis refractory to topical therapies. $#(Choice E)#  @Rituximab@ is a monoclonal antibody against the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes.  Once bound, rituximab initiates complement and cell-mediated B-cell cytotoxicity.  It is used to treat hematologic malignancies (eg, chronic lymphocytic leukemia) and rheumatologic diseases (eg, rheumatoid arthritis). $#Educational objective# Atopic dermatitis is an inflammatory condition that can be treated with calcineurin inhibitors (eg, pimecrolimus, tacrolimus) as second-line therapy after topical corticosteroids.  Calcineurin inhibitors work by inhibiting T-cell signaling needed to transcribe the proinflammatory cytokine IL-2, thereby decreasing inflammation.  ",

  "explanation_2": "This patient with pelvic pain, vaginal bleeding, and a tender left adnexal mass containing a gestational sac and yolk sac has an #ectopic pregnancy#.  Ectopic pregnancies occur due to pregnancy implantation in an extrauterine location, most commonly the @fallopian tube@.  Risk factors include prior sexually transmitted infection (eg, Chlamydia trachomatis), prior abdominal surgery, and prior ectopic pregnancy. $Medical treatment for an early, unruptured ectopic pregnancy is with #methotrexate#, a #folic acid antagonist#.  Methotrexate works by directly competing with folic acid to bind dihydrofolate reductase, thereby inhibiting the formation of tetrahydrofolate.  This decrease in tetrahydrofolate, an integral precursor to purine and pyrimidine synthesis, #inhibits DNA synthesis# and cell reproduction.  The result is #preferential destruction of actively proliferating cells#, such as #fetal cells and trophoblasts#. $#(Choice A)#  During pregnancy, the uterus increases its number of progesterone receptors so that circulating progesterone can stimulate the endometrial and myometrial growth required for pregnancy implantation and development.  Mifepristone, which acts as a progesterone antagonist when progesterone levels are high, is used for medical abortion because it causes necrosis of the uterine decidua and stimulates uterine contractions. $#(Choice B)#  Progestins (eg, levonorgestrel) thin the endometrial lining and decrease LH secretion, thereby inhibiting ovulation and preventing pregnancy.  They are not used in ectopic pregnancy management. $#(Choice C)#  Misoprostol is a synthetic prostaglandin E1 agonist that acts on the uterus to induce contractions; it can be used for labor induction or medical abortion. $#(Choice E)#  @Copper-containing intrauterine devices@ produce local inflammation to impair intrauterine implantation.  They are not used to treat ectopic pregnancies, which have implanted outside the uterus. $#Educational objective# Ectopic pregnancy occurs due to pregnancy implantation in an extrauterine location (eg, fallopian tube).  Medical treatment is with methotrexate, which inhibits DNA synthesis and cell reproduction, primarily in actively proliferating cells such as fetal cells and trophoblasts.  ",

  "explanation_2": "$This patient is presenting with #angle-closure glaucoma# (ACG) that was precipitated by use of over-the-counter eye drops.  ACG typically occurs in patients with a predisposing narrow chamber angle and develops when the normal drainage pathway of aqueous humor becomes blocked. $Aqueous humor is produced by the ciliary body and flows from the posterior chamber of the eye through the pupil into the anterior chamber and out of the eye via the trabecular network.  In susceptible individuals, dilation of the pupil causes the iris to press against the anterior surface of the lens.  This limits flow of aqueous humor through the pupil, causing the iris to bulge forward.

The estrogen component suppresses ovulation by acting on the @hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis@ to inhibit GnRH, FSH, and the midcycle LH surge; it also stabilizes the endometrium to control bleeding.  The progestin component also inhibits the HPO axis and further enhances contraceptive efficacy by thickening cervical mucus. $However, #estrogen is prothrombotic# and can increase the risk for severe complications, such as thrombosis, ischemic vascular disease, and stroke, particularly in patients with an elevated baseline risk.  Patients with #migraine with aura# (ie, visual disturbances or sensory [eg, paresthesia, numbness], auditory, or motor [eg, tremors, weakness] dysfunction) have a baseline #increased risk for ischemic stroke#, likely due to underlying endothelial dysfunction.  In these patients, exogenous estrogen use can further compound the risk for stroke; therefore, estrogen-containing OCPs are #contraindicated#. $#(Choice A)#  Elevated BMI is not a contraindication to the use of OCPs because they have similar efficacy in overweight/obese patients and do not cause significant weight gain. $#(Choice B)#  Because OCPs are a reversible form of contraception, a patient's gravidity and parity are not contraindications to their use.  In contrast, some gynecologic procedures (eg, endometrial ablation, uterine artery embolization) are contraindicated in patients who desire future fertility because the procedures can increase the risk for obstetric complications (eg, placenta accreta) in future pregnancies. $#(Choice D)#  Because of the risk for undiagnosed endometrial cancer, unexplained, abnormal uterine bleeding can be a contraindication to the initiation of hormonal contraception until further evaluation (eg, ultrasound, endometrial biopsy) is performed.  However, this patient's menstrual pattern is normal (eg, every 4-5 weeks, lasting 3-6 days); OCPs will likely improve her heavy bleeding. $#(Choice E)#  Unlike barrier method contraception, OCPs do not protect against human papillomavirus infection, which increases the risk for cervical cancer.  However, prior abnormal Pap testing is not a contraindication. $#(Choice F)#  Although a current pelvic infection is a contraindication to intrauterine device insertion, a recent or current sexually transmitted infection is not a contraindication to initiating OCPs. $#Educational objective# Estrogen-containing contraceptive pills (eg, combined estrogen/progestin oral contraceptive pills) are contraindicated in patients with migraine with aura due to the increased risk for ischemic stroke.

Leuprolide, when administered #continuously# and over a prolonged duration, produces 2 distinct hormonal patterns: $• Initially (ie, day 3), the GnRH receptor agonist effect of leuprolide stimulates the HPO axis; this causes increased FSH and estrogen secretion without a significant change in GnRH levels. $• With #prolonged use# (ie, day 60), leuprolide causes desensitization and downregulation of pituitary GnRH receptors, which eventually leads to #low FSH and estrogen# levels.

Letrozole and clomiphene stimulate gonadotropin release via manipulation of different targets on the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis: $• #Letrozole# acts on the ovary.  Patients with PCOS typically have increased ovarian estrogen (eg, estradiol) production, which inhibits FSH, LH, and ovulation.  Ovarian estrogen production occurs primarily by the conversion of androgens (produced by theca cells) into estrogens within granulosa cells that contain the enzyme aromatase.  Letrozole #inhibits aromatase# (ie, prevents androgen-to-estrogen conversion) and #suppresses ovarian estradiol production#.  Letrozole also inhibits aromatase in adipose tissue, decreasing another source of estrogen (eg, estrone).  In response, the pituitary releases more FSH and LH, which stimulates ovulation. $• #Clomiphene# acts on estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus and pituitary.  When estrogen levels are high (as in PCOS), there is negative estrogenic feedback on both the hypothalamus and pituitary to stop the release of GnRH, FSH, and LH.  @Clomiphene@ binds to estrogen receptors for an extended period, resulting in receptor depletion in the hypothalamus and pituitary, thereby allowing for continued FSH and LH release #(choice B).# $#(Choice A)#  Bromocriptine, a dopamine receptor agonist, decreases prolactin secretion.  Prolactin normally inhibits FSH release, so patients with hyperprolactinemia (eg, lactotroph adenoma) often have infertility.  In these patients, bromocriptine can normalize prolactin levels and restore FSH and estrogen levels. $#(Choice C)#  Increased endometrial proliferation, which increases the risk for endometrial hyperplasia or cancer, occurs with the use of unopposed estrogen (eg, estrogen-only hormone therapy) or certain selective estrogen receptor modulators (eg, tamoxifen). $#(Choice D)#  When administered continuously, leuprolide (@GnRH agonist@) downregulates pituitary GnRH receptors and decreases FSH and estrogen, causing a hypogonadotropic, hypogonadal state clinically similar to that of menopause. $#Educational objective# Polycystic ovary syndrome can present with irregular menses, enlarged ovaries, and anovulatory infertility.  Letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, acts on the ovary and peripheral adipose tissue to inhibit androgen-to-estrogen conversion by the enzyme aromatase; the subsequent decrease in estrogen production causes the pituitary to release more FSH and LH, thereby stimulating ovulation.

Phenylephrine, xylometazoline, and oxymetazoline are used as topical preparations for the treatment of allergic rhinitis and common cold associated congestion and rhinitis. $These medications, however, are characterized by rapidly declining effect after a few days of use.  This phenomenon is called tachyphylaxis.  It occurs because of decreased production of endogenous norepinephrine from the nerve terminals due to a negative feedback mechanism, resulting in relative vasodilation (ie, removal of normal vasoconstrictive tone) and subsequent edema and congestion.  This leads to exacerbation of the nasal congestion symptoms.  Rebound rhinorrhea (ie, rhinitis medicamentosa) is described as nasal congestion without cough, sneezing, or postnasal drip.  Rhinorrhea may or may not be present (note the paradox in naming).  Rebound rhinorrhea is associated with the use of topical decongestants for > 3 days.  The use of adrenergic agonists should be stopped to allow the restoration of normal norepinephrine feedback pathways. $Another medication associated with the phenomenon of tachyphylaxis is nitroglycerine.

In this case, diphenhydramine should be discontinued as it is highly anticholinergic and has not helped with the patient's chronic insomnia. $#(Choice A)#  Although topiramate can be considered for migraine prevention, discontinuing unnecessary medication that is causing adverse effects takes priority. $#(Choice B)#  Zolpidem is a pharmacological treatment option for insomnia but should not be added to the patient's regimen as it has adverse effects in older adults, including increased risk of falls and confusion.  Non-pharmacological strategies (eg, cognitive behavioral therapy) are preferred for initial management of primary insomnia in older adults. $#(Choices C and E)#  Cystography is not indicated as this patient's urinary retention is more likely due to anticholinergic side effects.  A head CT scan would be extremely low yield in this patient with chronic headaches. $#(Choice F)#  Increasing the dose of amitriptyline would likely exacerbate the patient's anticholinergic side effects. $#Educational objective# Review of medications to determine if any are unnecessary or causing adverse effects is essential in providing high-quality patient care.  The cumulative anticholinergic burden of multiple medications is especially problematic in the elderly.  "

  "explanation_2": "$#Bioavailability# refers to the fraction of administered drug that reaches the systemic circulation and is therefore available for eliciting the desired pharmacologic effect.  A drug administered by the intravenous (IV) route has 100% bioavailability by definition.  For other modes of drug administration (eg, oral [PO], intramuscular [IM], subcutaneous [SQ], transdermal [TD], rectal [PR]), the bioavailability is usually less than 100%. $The bioavailability of a drug for a given route of administration can be determined by plotting plasma drug concentrations over time for a given dose administered by both the IV route and the other route being studied (eg, PO).  The #area under the curve# (AUC) of each plot represents the #total systemic drug exposure# for the given dose and route #(choice A).#  Bioavailability can then be determined by comparing the AUCs of each curve.  In this case, PO bioavailability can be calculated by #dividing the AUC of the PO curve by the AUC of the IV curve#. $In the case of PO administration, bioavailability depends upon the drug's ability to cross the intestinal mucosa and can be influenced by gastric acidity and motility, the presence of food or other drugs in the gut, and first-pass metabolism by the intestine and liver. $#(Choice C)#  The maximal concentration at the peak of the PO curve (ie, peak plasma level) is dose dependent and is not an indicator of drug bioavailability. $#(Choice D)#  PO administration of a drug usually results in lower peak serum drug levels compared to IV administration, even when PO bioavailability is near 100%, due to delayed absorption from the gastrointestinal tract (versus near-instantaneous delivery of IV drugs).  As a result, comparing peak PO to peak IV concentration levels is not an appropriate way to determine bioavailability. $#Educational objective# Bioavailability refers to the fraction of administered drug that reaches the systemic circulation.  For a drug administered by any route other than intravenous (IV), bioavailability is usually less than 100%.  Bioavailability can be determined by graphing plasma drug concentrations over time for a given dose administered by both the IV route and the other route being studied.  Oral (PO) bioavailability is calculated by dividing the area under the PO curve by the area under the IV curve.  "
