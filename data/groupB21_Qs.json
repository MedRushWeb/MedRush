The risk of adverse drug events increases with the number of medications, and minimizing the use of non-essential medications can reduce the risk of an adverse event.  This patient is likely experiencing anticholinergic side effects (ie, urinary retention, constipation) due to the combined anticholinergic effects of amitriptyline and diphenhydramine.  Anticholinergic side effects are particularly common in older adults and can also include impaired memory, confusion, hallucinations, dry mouth, blurry vision, impaired sweating, tachycardia, and increased risk for falls.  Physicians should prioritize discontinuing unnecessary medications  prior to pursuing further workup or adding additional medications for chronic problems.  In this case, diphenhydramine should be discontinued as it is highly anticholinergic and has not helped with the patient's chronic insomnia. $#(Choice A)#  Although topiramate can be considered for migraine prevention, discontinuing unnecessary medication that is causing adverse effects takes priority. $#(Choice B)#  Zolpidem is a pharmacological treatment option for insomnia but should not be added to the patient's regimen as it has adverse effects in older adults, including increased risk of falls and confusion.  Non-pharmacological strategies (eg, cognitive behavioral therapy) are preferred for initial management of primary insomnia in older adults. $#(Choices C and E)#  Cystography is not indicated as this patient's urinary retention is more likely due to anticholinergic side effects.  A head CT scan would be extremely low yield in this patient with chronic headaches. $#(Choice F)#  Increasing the dose of amitriptyline would likely exacerbate the patient's anticholinergic side effects. $#Educational objective# Review of medications to determine if any are unnecessary or causing adverse effects is essential in providing high-quality patient care.  The cumulative anticholinergic burden of multiple medications is especially problematic in the elderly.  "

A drug administered by the intravenous (IV) route has 100% bioavailability by definition.  For other modes of drug administration (eg, oral [PO], intramuscular [IM], subcutaneous [SQ], transdermal [TD], rectal [PR]), the bioavailability is usually less than 100%. $The bioavailability of a drug for a given route of administration can be determined by plotting plasma drug concentrations over time for a given dose administered by both the IV route and the other route being studied (eg, PO).  The #area under the curve# (AUC) of each plot represents the #total systemic drug exposure# for the given dose and route #(choice A).#  Bioavailability can then be determined by comparing the AUCs of each curve.  In this case, PO bioavailability can be calculated by #dividing the AUC of the PO curve by the AUC of the IV curve#. $In the case of PO administration, bioavailability depends upon the drug's ability to cross the intestinal mucosa and can be influenced by gastric acidity and motility, the presence of food or other drugs in the gut, and first-pass metabolism by the intestine and liver. $#(Choice C)#  The maximal concentration at the peak of the PO curve (ie, peak plasma level) is dose dependent and is not an indicator of drug bioavailability. $#(Choice D)#  PO administration of a drug usually results in lower peak serum drug levels compared to IV administration, even when PO bioavailability is near 100%, due to delayed absorption from the gastrointestinal tract (versus near-instantaneous delivery of IV drugs).

  "explanation_2": "With #advancing age#, the cardiopulmonary system undergoes physiologic changes that can lead to reduced ability to cope with critical illness (eg, severe burns).  One of the major changes in the cardiovascular system involves #decreased responsiveness to adrenergic stimuli#, which contributes to a lower maximal heart rate and #reduced maximal cardiac output#. $#Critical illness# often involves a #hypermetabolic state# (ie, increased resting energy expenditure) and a marked decrease in intravascular blood volume (eg, evaporative losses with severe burn injury, vascular leakage with sepsis), both of which necessitate a sympathetic-mediated increase in heart rate and contractility to help maintain organ and tissue perfusion.  The attenuation of this response with age likely contributes to poorer critical illness outcomes in elderly patients. $#(Choices B and E)#  Compliance of the aorta and other large arteries decreases with age, resulting in isolated systolic hypertension and an increase in left ventricular afterload.  In response to the increased afterload, mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy occurs, resulting in increased left ventricular wall thickness.  The reduced arterial compliance also decreases blood volume retained in the arterial system, which increases susceptibility to hypotension during critical illness. $#(Choices C and F)#  Degeneration of lung elastin with age causes alveolar enlargement and increased air trapping.  The alveolar enlargement decreases the percentage of the alveolar surface in contact with alveolar capillaries, reducing gas exchange surface area.  This effect, combined with reduced alveolar ventilation due to increased air trapping, increases ventilation-perfusion mismatching. $#(Choice D)#  Diaphragmatic strength decreases with age.  This has little effect on resting tidal volumes, but it increases the susceptibility to respiratory fatigue during periods of respiratory stress (eg, critical illness). $#Educational objective# Physiologic age-related changes in the cardiopulmonary system can lead to reduced ability to cope with critical illness.

  "explanation_2": "$This graph depicts a vascular bed in which arterial/arteriolar resistance increases as the tissue O2 content decreases.  This response is unique to the #pulmonary vasculature#, in which #hypoxic vasoconstriction# occurs to divert blood flow away from underventilated lung regions and toward well-ventilated lung areas.  This phenomenon #improves ventilation-perfusion mismatch# by decreasing physiologic shunting in poorly ventilated alveoli, leading to overall more #efficient gas exchange#.  The relationship between hypoxia and vascular resistance is reversed throughout the rest of the body, ensuring that hypoxic organs and tissues receive increased blood flow. $#(Choice A)#  Although the cerebral circulation is more sensitive to blood CO2 levels (small degrees of hypercapnia lead to vasodilation), hypoxia causes significant arteriolar dilation when the partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) falls below 50 mm Hg. $#(Choice B)#  In the coronary vasculature, subendocardial blood flow is mediated by the local tissue PO2, adenosine, prostacyclin, and nitric oxide.  Decreased tissue PO2 promotes vasodilation of arterioles in the myocardium. $#(Choice C)#  A large increase in sympathetic tone may cause vasoconstriction of the renal vasculature, but hypoxia does not have this effect. $#(Choice E)#  Parasympathetic-induced intestinal vasodilation occurs in response to digestive chyme passing over intestinal mucosa.  Sympathetic tone (not hypoxia) plays a large role in the splanchnic vasoconstriction that occurs with exercise or significant hypovolemia. $#Educational objective# The pulmonary vascular bed is unique in that tissue hypoxia results in a vasoconstrictive response.  Such hypoxic vasoconstriction occurs in the small muscular pulmonary arteries to divert blood flow away from underventilated lung regions and toward well-ventilated lung areas to minimize ventilation-perfusion mismatch, leading to more efficient overall gas exchange.

  "explanation_2": "This patient is most likely suffering from #acute mountain sickness (AMS)#, a type of #high-altitude illness# resulting from low partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) in environments >2,500 m (8,000 ft).  Although the fraction of oxygen in inspired air remains constant (21%) at different terrestrial elevations, barometric pressure drops with increasing altitude, leading to decreased pO2 in the air and lungs. $In an otherwise healthy patient, the pO2 rapidly equilibrates between the alveoli and arterial blood, causing #hypoxemia# when the pO2 drops below 80 mm Hg.  Several acute physiological changes occur in response to the resulting #hypobaric hypoxia#: $‚Ä¢ Increased firing of @peripheral chemoreceptors@ causes hyperventilation, which directly reduces hypoxemia and improves tissue oxygenation #(choice A).# $‚Ä¢ #Increased 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) #synthesis by erythrocytes, which shifts the @O2-hemoglobin dissociation curve@ to the right, decreasing the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen and facilitating the offloading of oxygen in peripheral tissues. $Hyperventilation also decreases the partial pressure of carbon dioxide, resulting in increased blood pH (#respiratory alkalosis#).  Common symptoms of AMS include headache, fatigue, dyspnea, dizziness, and sleep disturbances.  Most cases subside within 2 days but can progress to life-threatening cerebral and/or pulmonary edema in susceptible patients.  In the absence of underlying pathology, symptoms typically resolve within 48 hours as the kidneys #increase HCO3‚àí excretion# to compensate for the alkalosis, restoring pH toward the normal range and improving symptoms #(choice E).# $#(Choice B)#  Hypoxia induces widespread vasoconstriction of the pulmonary vasculature; this increases pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary arterial pressure and can result in pulmonary edema. $#(Choice C)#  Hypoxemia stimulates increased erythropoietin production in the renal cortex, which results in polycythemia and increased oxygen-carrying capacity over time (days to weeks of sustained hypoxemia). $#Educational objective# People traveling to elevations >2500 m (8000 ft) can develop high-altitude illness, characterized by hypobaric hypoxia with the potential to develop life-threatening cerebral and/or pulmonary edema.

Patients have significant hypertonia, including #clenched hands# with #overlapping fingers#.  Anomalies of cardiac (eg, #ventricular septal defect#, patent ductus arteriosus), genitourinary (eg, horseshoe kidney), and gastrointestinal (eg, Meckel's diverticulum, malrotation) systems are characteristic.  Prenatal ultrasound findings include fetal growth restriction, as seen in this patient.  The majority of those affected die in utero; half of livebirths die by age 2 weeks.  Surviving patients have severe intellectual disability. $#(Choice A)#  Cri-du-chat syndrome (5p deletion) presents with a weak or \"cat-like\" cry as well as hypotonia, failure to thrive, and developmental delay.  Phenotypic features include microcephaly, low-set ears, hypertelorism, and a broad nasal bridge. $#(Choice B)#  Features of DiGeorge syndrome (22q11 deletion) include @aortic arch anomalies@, thymic hypoplasia/aplasia, and hypocalcemia (parathyroid gland underdevelopment).  Phenotypically, neonates can present with hypertelorism, low-set ears, micrognathia, and cleft palate. $#(Choice C)#  @Trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome)@ presents with midline facial defects (eg, holoprosencephaly, cleft lip/palate), musculoskeletal abnormalities (eg, polydactyly), and gastrointestinal anomalies (eg, omphalocele, umbilical hernia).  Trisomy 13 is notably not associated with overlapping fingers. $#(Choice E)#  @Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome)@ is the most common autosomal trisomy.  Classic findings include a flat facial profile, upslanting palpebral fissures, low-set small ears, single transverse palmar crease, and hypotonia. $#Educational objective# Trisomy 18, or Edwards syndrome, is most commonly the result of meiotic nondisjunction due to advanced maternal age.  Key findings include fetal growth retardation, hypertonia (clenched hands with overlapping fingers), rocker bottom feet, and cardiac/gastrointestinal/renal defects.  ",

  "explanation_2": "Organogenesis relies on coordinated embryologic signaling between tissues for normal development.  #Reciprocal induction# is a type of signaling that occurs between two tissues; #both must be present# to induce normal development. $#Eye development# is an example of reciprocal induction, in which signaling molecules from the optic vesicle bind receptors on the surface ectoderm, which induces lens formation via various intracellular signal transduction pathways.  The developing lens then acts as the inducer by signaling development of the optic vesicle into the optic cup. $Reciprocal induction also occurs between the @metanephric blastema@ and the #ureteric bud#, which are embryologic structures that give rise to the mature kidneys and collecting system, respectively: $‚Ä¢ The metanephric blastema induces formation of the ureteric bud, which then induces the metanephric blastema to condense and epithelialize. $‚Ä¢ In sequential iterations, the metanephric blastema then induces the ureteric bud to branch and elongate into the renal collecting system and ureters, whereas the ureteric bud induces formation of segmented nephrons, ultimately forming mature renal parenchyma. $Normal #kidney and urinary tract development# depends on this reciprocal interaction because neither the metanephric blastema nor the ureteric bud would develop normally if isolated from the other (eg, defects in ureteric bud branching can result in renal agenesis). $#(Choice A)#  The endoderm induces splanchnic mesoderm development into primitive endothelial cells that join together to form blood vessels; however, no reciprocal signaling exists from the splanchnic mesoderm to the endoderm. $#(Choice C)#  Neural crest cells differentiate into enteric ganglia in response to signaling from the foregut, but the foregut develops into the intestines independent of neural crest cells.  For example, Hirschsprung disease is a disorder of neural crest cell migration characterized by a segment of aganglionic colon, although the intestine itself develops normally otherwise. $#(Choice D)#  Sertoli cells in the fetal testis signal primordial germ cells to develop into mature gametes (ie, sperm), but no reciprocal signaling exists from germ cells to Sertoli cells. $#Educational objective# Reciprocal induction is a type of signaling that occurs between two tissues that requires both be present to induce normal development.

Discordance between anatomy and genotype is diagnostic of a disorder of @sex development@, and in this case the findings are consistent with #5-alpha reductase deficiency#. $Leydig cells within the fetal testes in genotypic males (XY) secrete testosterone, which induces wolffian duct differentiation into male internal genital ducts.  Some testosterone is also converted to #dihydrotestosterone# (DHT) by the enzyme 5-alpha reductase.  DHT induces genital tubercle differentiation into #male external genitalia#.  In the absence of 5-alpha reductase and DHT, the genital tubercle differentiates into female external genitalia, as in this patient. $Because the uterus, fallopian tubes, and proximal vagina derive from the M√ºller duct, which involutes in the presence of #antim√ºllerian hormone# (AMH) secreted by Sertoli cells in the fetal testes, these structures are absent, and the vagina ends in a #blind pouch#. $Most patients have a female phenotype at birth, and the disorder is diagnosed at puberty due to the development of secondary male sexual characteristics (eg, body hair, increased muscle mass from rising testosterone) or #primary amenorrhea#.  Breast development (ie, gynecomastia) does not occur because increased serum testosterone (relative to estradiol) inhibits breast tissue proliferation. $#(Choice B)#  Leydig cells secrete testosterone (required for development of internal male genital ducts).  The presence of epididymis and vas deferens is inconsistent with Leydig cell aplasia. $#(Choice C)#  Genotypic males (XY) with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome are phenotypically female and have primary amenorrhea due to absent internal female genital ducts (from appropriate AMH action).  In contrast to this case, however, internal male genital ducts (vas deferens, epididymis) would be absent and gynecomastia (not Tanner stage 1) would be expected due to the nonfunctional androgen receptors. $#(Choice D)#  In patients with the XX genotype, 21-hydroxylase deficiency (ie, inability to convert 17-hydroxyprogesterone to 11-deoxycortisol) causes virilization.  A genotypic male (XY) with 21-hydroxylase deficiency would have normal male external genitalia. $#(Choice E)#  Genotypic males (XY) with loss of the sex-determining region of the Y chromosome (ie, SRY gene) do not develop testes.  Absence of testicular hormones (testosterone, AMH) results in internal female genital ducts and external female genitalia. $#Educational objective# The enzyme 5-alpha reductase converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, which drives development of external male genitalia.  Genotypic males (XY) with 5-alpha reductase deficiency develop female external genitalia but have internal male genital ducts (eg, vas deferens) instead of internal female genital ducts (eg, uterus).
