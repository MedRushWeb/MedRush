It travels superiorly through the mediastinum (posterior to the esophagus) and drains into the #junction between the left subclavian and jugular veins# in the lower neck. It is most commonly injured during #thoracic procedures# (eg, esophagectomy) but can be injured in neck procedures as well (eg, cervical lymph node removal). Injury can result in leakage of lymph into either the neck or the thorax because a transected duct may retract into the chest.$The thoracic duct collects lymph from most of the body, including the abdominal viscera, the viscera of the left hemithorax, all tissue inferior to the umbilicus, and all left-sided tissues superior to the umbilicus (the right head, arm, and thorax drain into the much smaller right lymphatic duct).$#(Choices A and F)# The trachea and esophagus are deeper structures in the central neck that are covered by strap muscles; they are unlikely to be injured during removal of cervical lymph nodes in the lateral neck. In addition, although injury to the esophagus or trachea can cause pleural effusion, such injury is typically accompanied by air accumulation (eg, crepitus in the neck and/or pneumomediastinum).$(Choice B) The innominate artery is the first branch of the aortic arch, and it crosses the midtrachea from left to right (in the thorax). It does not travel through the left neck. In addition, injury to the innominate artery would cause massive blood loss, resulting in immediate hemodynamic instability.$(Choice C) The apex of the lung can project into the neck and be injured in some neck surgical procedures. However, injury would cause an acute pneumothorax rather than a slowly accumulating pleural effusion.$(Choice D) The phrenic nerve, which originates from C3-C5 and travels with the internal jugular vein, can be injured during neck procedures.

Lung transplantation may be complicated by both acute and chronic rejection.  Chronic rejection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality and occurs in almost half of all patients within 5 years of transplantation.  These patients commonly present with dyspnea and a dry cough.  Spirometry shows an #airflow limitation# with a drop in both the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and the #FEV1# to forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio. $ Chronic rejection affects the small bronchioli producing the obstructive lung disease known as #bronchiolitis obliterans#.  Initially, histopathology shows lymphocytic inflammation and destruction of the epithelium of the small airways.  Subsequently, fibrinopurulent exudate and granulation tissue are found in the lumen of the bronchioli, which ultimately results in fibrosis, scarring, and the progressive obliteration of small airways. $ (Choice A)  Acute rejection usually occurs within the first 6 months.  It is frequently asymptomatic and commonly discovered on surveillance biopsies.  Histopathology demonstrates perivascular and interstitial mononuclear cell infiltrates. $ #(Choices B and F)#  Underlying lung disease, such as pulmonary hypertension or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), may recur in the lung allograft.  However, the obstructive pattern on spirometry and the histopathology findings are better explained by chronic rejection than by pulmonary hypertension or COPD, the latter of which would also show increased goblet cells and mucus gland hyperplasia. $ (Choice D)  Ischemia-reperfusion injury is a form of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema that occurs in the allograft due to surgical trauma or organ ischemia.  It is seen during the first few days following transplantation. $ (Choice E)  Infection is a leading cause of death in lung transplant recipients.  Cytomegalovirus causes the most significant opportunistic infection in transplant recipients.  Infected cells have a characteristic intranuclear inclusion surrounded by a clear halo (owl's eye inclusion). $ Educational objective Chronic rejection is a major problem in lung transplant recipients; it affects small airways, causing bronchiolitis obliterans.  It is characterized by lymphocytic inflammation, fibrosis, and, ultimately, destruction of the bronchioles."

Patients typically have dyspnea, nonproductive cough, finger clubbing, and inspiratory crackles.

The presence of these organisms in this patient's lung lesion is highly suggestive of a developing @lung abscess@.  As an abscess evolves, it typically forms a cavitary lesion with an identifiable @air-fluid level@ on imaging.  Symptoms are often indolent and include fever, night sweats, weight loss, and a cough producing #foul-smelling sputum# (indicating anaerobes). $ Lung abscesses are usually caused by one of the following: $ • #Aspiration# of oral bacteria into the lower airways (most common) – These abscesses are usually composed of a combination of #anaerobic oral flora# (eg, Peptostreptococcus, Prevotella, Bacteroides, Fusobacterium) and aerobic organisms (eg, Streptococcus).  Risk is greatest in those who have conditions associated with #loss of consciousness# or #impaired swallowing#, such as alcoholism, drug abuse, #neurologic disease# (eg, seizures, stroke), or anatomic abnormalities (eg, esophageal strictures or diverticula). $ • Bacterial pneumonia – Lung abscess can occur in the setting of certain bacterial pneumonias such as those due to Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  Most cases arise in the hospital setting and occur in patients with immunosuppression, older age, or underlying lung disease. $ • Bacteremia and/or infectious endocarditis – Hematogenous spread of an infection to the lung usually causes multiple, monomicrobial lung abscesses.  The most common causative agents are Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species. $ (Choice A)  Mitral valve prolapse is a risk factor for development of subacute bacterial endocarditis (with Streptococcus species).  Left-sided endocarditis could cause septic embolization to downstream organs (eg, spleen, brain) but would not send septic emboli to the lungs. $ (Choice B)  Bronchogenic carcinoma can cause bronchial obstruction and postobstructive pneumonia, which may lead to secondary abscess formation.  However, these lung abscesses would be less likely to contain oral anaerobic flora. $ (Choice C)  Lung abscess may be associated with a prior penetrating trauma.  Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species (introduced from the skin) are usually responsible. $ (Choice E)  Tobacco smoking compromises pulmonary defenses and predisposes patients to developing community-acquired pneumonia due to common pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae.  These organisms are less likely to cause lung abscess. $ (Choice F)  Urinary infections can be associated with bacteremia, particularly in those with diabetes mellitus, advanced age, or structural urinary abnormalities.  However, most urinary infections are caused by coliform bacteria (eg, E coli) from the lower gastrointestinal tract.  Lung abscess is not a common complication of urinary infection, and Peptostreptococcus and Fusobacterium would be unusual urinary organisms. $ Educational objective Lung abscess is most often due to aspiration of anaerobic oral bacteria such as Peptostreptococcus, Prevotella, Bacteroides, and Fusobacterium species.  Risk factors for lung abscess include conditions that increase aspiration risk, such as alcoholism, drug abuse, seizure disorders, previous stroke, and dementia.",

The most likely cause is the dimorphic fungus #Histoplasma capsulatum#, which exists as a mold in the soil of the #Ohio# and Mississippi River Valleys (midwestern/central United States). $ The pathogen is inhaled into the lungs, where it converts to yeast form and is phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages.  Macrophages cannot initially eliminate the organism due to microbial virulence factors that prevent phagolysosome formation and acidification.  Therefore, H capsulatum is able to replicate within the macrophage and spread through the draining #lymphatic system# and (often) into the reticuloendothelial system (eg, #spleen#, liver). $ After about 2 weeks, patients with intact immunity develop a cell-mediated immune response that contains the infection within granulomas.  Over time, the granulomas fibrose and #calcify# and can be visualized on radiographic imaging at the initial sites of infection (eg, lungs, hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes, spleen).  In healthy patients, most infections with H capsulatum are asymptomatic and are therefore often discovered incidentally during evaluation for an unrelated condition (eg, nephrolithiasis). $ (Choice B)  Metastatic cancer often causes @multiple lung lesions@.  However, these lesions generally enlarge in size over time and calcification is rare. $ (Choice C)  @Miliary tuberculosis@ is marked by multiple pulmonary lesions and clinical illness (eg, fever, night sweats); calcified lesions would be atypical.  Although primary tuberculosis is often associated with a calcified lung and an ipsilateral hilar lymph node lesion (Ranke complex), tuberculosis is unlikely in this case given the patient's negative tuberculin skin test. $ (Choice D)  Parathyroid adenoma is a benign tumor that does not spread to the lungs; it is often associated with hypercalcemia due to increased secretion of parathyroid hormone.  Although metastatic calcification can be a rare manifestion of hyperparathyroidism (it is more common with end-stage renal disease), such patients would almost certainly have systemic signs of hypercalcemia (eg, weakness, fatigue, depressed mood). $ (Choice E)  Silica inhalation can cause innumerable, small, rounded opacities in the upper lobes of the lungs that may fibrose over time, resulting in pulmonary disease.  Silica exposure is primarily occupational (eg, miners, sandblasters). $ Educational objective Histoplasma capsulatum replicates within macrophages and often spreads from the lungs through the pulmonary lymphatics to the reticuloendothelial system (eg, spleen, liver).  Most healthy individuals quickly contain the infection within granulomas and do not become ill; a minority develop self-limited pneumonia.

The #pulmonary capillary occlusion# impairs gas exchange and induces #hypoxemia#; release of free fatty acids from the fat globules also causes local toxic injury to the endothelium, potentially leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome. $ Some fat globules escape the lungs via precapillary arteriovenous shunts that open due to increased pulmonary artery pressure.

None of these conditions would typically be associated with the neurologic impairment or petechial rash seen with FES. $ (Choice E)  Focal necrosis of alveolar walls with associated intra-alveolar hemorrhage is often seen with pulmonary hemorrhage syndromes (eg, anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody disease, granulomatosis with polyangiitis). $ Educational objective Fat embolism syndrome should be strongly suspected in a patient with severe long-bone and/or pelvic fractures who develops acute-onset neurologic abnormalities, hypoxemia, and a petechial rash.  Occlusion of the pulmonary microvessels by fat globules is an early histologic finding of this syndrome."

          "explanation_2": "#Secondhand smoke# (SHS) exposure can adversely affect nearly every organ system, most notably the respiratory tract (eg, pneumonia, asthma).  One of the most serious effects of SHS exposure is the increased risk for #sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)#. $ SIDS refers to the unexpected death of a previously healthy infant with an inconclusive postmortem examination.  Almost all cases are associated with at least 1 risk factor, such as prematurity, an unsafe sleep environment, and smoke exposure.  Smoke exposure likely contributes to SIDS by causing #impaired arousal# and cardiovascular response to stimuli (eg, hypoxemia). $ The risk of SIDS is further increased in cases of #maternal cigarette use during pregnancy#, which is associated with impaired fetal oxygenation and direct exposure of the fetus to toxins (eg, nicotine, carbon monoxide).  The degree of risk correlates with the amount of cigarette use, suggesting a dose-response relationship between smoking and SIDS. $ (Choice A)  Because maternal smoking during pregnancy (not seen here) increases the risk of preterm delivery, the risk of prematurity-associated complications (eg, apnea of prematurity) is also increased.  However, these risks do not increase with postnatal SHS exposure.  Moreover, apnea of prematurity typically presents with apneic episodes in the first 2-3 days of life. $ (Choice B)  SHS increases the risk for respiratory tract disease and recurrent otitis media in children; parents who smoke outside the home should be counseled on cessation because chemicals from cigarette smoke are adsorbed and retained by clothing, skin, and hair and therefore still pose a risk to children.  SHS is not associated with an increased risk for epilepsy. $ (Choice C)  SHS does not increase the risk for failure to thrive in infancy.  In fact, SHS may be associated with childhood obesity. $ (Choice E)  SHS exposure in childhood increases the risk for atrial fibrillation in adulthood but is not associated with ventricular arrhythmias. $ Educational objective Maternal tobacco use during pregnancy and secondhand smoke exposure are associated with an increased risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).  Pathophysiology of the association between smoke exposure and SIDS may relate to impaired arousal and cardiovascular response to stimuli (eg, airflow obstruction)."

Meconium ileus is a very specific finding for #cystic fibrosis# (CF).  Although only 10%-20% of infants with CF will have meconium ileus at birth, almost all full-term infants with meconium ileus are eventually diagnosed with CF.  Abnormalities in chloride, sodium, and water transport by the ductal epithelium of intestinal mucous glands cause isotonic dehydration of the lumen contents.

However, HD typically presents with increased rectal tone, \"squirt sign\" (forceful expulsion of stool after rectal examination), and obstruction at the rectosigmoid region with a transition zone between the aganglionic rectum and proximal dilated colon.  Enterocolitis (diarrhea, abdominal pain/distension, and fever) is the most common cause of mortality in patients with HD. $ (Choice B)  Focal biliary or multilobular cirrhosis due to plugging of bile canaliculi by dehydrated mucinous material develops in approximately 5% of CF patients.  Death from cirrhotic liver failure is much less likely than terminal pneumonia. $ (Choice C)  Most patients with CF have exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, which causes malabsorption and steatorrhea.

This leads to increased intestinal absorption of calcium and subsequent hypercalcemia. $ (Choice A)  Increased bone turnover may be seen in patients with sarcoidosis who have very high 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels, but this is a less significant source than intestinal absorption of calcium.  Regardless, the underlying cause of both of these mechanisms is excess 1-alpha-hydroxylase expression by activated macrophages. $ (Choice C)  Osteolytic metastases can cause hypercalcemia due to increased bone resorption in areas surrounding malignant cells.  However, this patient, a nonsmoker with noncaseating granulomas on biopsy, has no specific signs of malignancy. $ (Choice D)  PTH levels in sarcoidosis are typically suppressed due to elevated levels of calcium and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. $ (Choice E)  Chronic renal failure causes phosphorus retention.  The excess serum phosphorus can cause hypocalcemia by combining with intravascular calcium. $ Educational objective Hypercalcemia in sarcoidosis is caused by parathyroid hormone-independent formation of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D by activated macrophages.  This leads to increased intestinal absorption of calcium.",

Although cough and shortness of breath can occur during asthma exacerbations, fever and a lobar infiltrate are not typical. $ (Choice C)  Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is associated with pulmonary fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition leading to progressive destruction of the pulmonary architecture.  Patients typically present with slowly worsening dyspnea, nonproductive cough, and bilateral \"Velcro\"-sounding crackles.  Fever is uncommon and chest x-ray usually reveals increased @reticular (interstitial) markings@. $ (Choice E)  Chronic bronchitis is associated with goblet cell metaplasia and inflammation in the large airways.  The hypersecretion of mucous can lead to chronic productive cough, dyspnea, and wheezes on examination.  Lobar infiltrate is uncommon as the alveoli are not primarily affected. $ Educational objective: Lobar pneumonia is marked by the cytokine-mediated accumulation of neutrophils and proteinaceous material in the alveoli.  Over several days, the proteinaceous material becomes fibrinous, neutrophils are replaced by macrophages, and macrophages digest the fibrinous exudate, thereby restoring normal lung histology.",

Inhalation of fine asbestos fibers causes epithelial cell injury, activation of macrophages, and chronic interstitial inflammation and fibrosis.The major clinical manifestations of asbestos exposure include the following: $ • #Pleural disease# includes pleural effusions and pleural plaques.  Pleural plaques are a hallmark of asbestos exposure that typically affect the parietal pleura along the lower lungs and diaphragm.  The plaques are composed of discrete circumscribed areas of dense collagen that frequently become calcified. $ • #Asbestosis# is characterized by progressive #pulmonary fibrosis# that is most predominant in the lower lobes and by the presence of #asbestos bodies# (golden-brown beaded rods with translucent centers). $ • #Bronchogenic carcinoma# is the #most common malignancy# associated with asbestos exposure.  Smoking and asbestos exposure have a synergistic effect on the development of lung carcinoma, increasing the risk from 6-fold in nonsmoking patients with asbestos exposure to 60-fold in asbestos-exposed patients who smoke regularly. $ • #Malignant mesothelioma# is a rare malignancy of the pleura for which asbestos is the only known environmental risk factor.

          "explanation_2": "$This patient has a urinary tract infection complicated by fever and hemodynamic instability consistent with #sepsis#.  Her rapid-onset respiratory failure is suggestive of #acute respiratory distress syndrome# (ARDS).  ARDS is characterized by @bilateral pulmonary infiltrates@ and hypoxemia in the absence of heart failure.  It can occur due to direct pulmonary trauma (eg, pulmonary contusions, inhaled irritants) or indirect nonpulmonary insults (eg, sepsis, burns, pancreatitis) that result in pulmonary epithelial and/or endothelial injury. $ The 3 phases of ARDS follow the disease's progression:$ • #Exudative phase:#  Inflammatory cytokines (eg, tumor necrosis factor, IL-1, IL-6) activate the pulmonary endothelium and recruit neutrophils to the lung tissue.  Resultant endothelial damage leads to increased capillary permeability and #leakage of protein-rich fluid into the alveolar space#.  Organization of the edema and cellular debris leads to the formation of @hyaline membranes@. $ • #Proliferative phase:#  One to two weeks later, endothelial cells, pneumocytes, and fibroblasts proliferate in attempts to repair the damaged lung; collagen is deposited and scarring may occur.  Edema is reabsorbed. $ • #Fibrotic phase:#  In a minority of patients, excessive collagen deposition leads to irreversible pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension. $ (Choice B)  Necrotizing inflammation and pulmonary hemorrhage are commonly associated with granulomatosis with polyangiitis, which involves both the lungs and the kidneys.  However, this condition normally presents subacutely with cough, hemoptysis, and nephritic syndrome; this patient's acute respiratory decline in the setting of sepsis is more consistent with ARDS. $ (Choice C)  Noncaseating granulomas are found in sarcoidosis, which typically presents more chronically with cough, skin findings, or uveitis.  Hemodynamic instability and acute respiratory failure would be unexpected. $ (Choice D)  Mucus plugging typically occurs in patients with underlying lung disease (eg, cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).  Mucus plugs can cause hypoxemia but would not be expected to cause hypotension and fevers, and acute respiratory deterioration in the setting of sepsis is more likely due to ARDS. $ (Choice E)  Wedge-shaped areas of hemorrhagic necrosis can be seen with pulmonary embolism, which can cause acute respiratory failure, hypotension, and tachycardia.  However, patients often have chest pain, and in general, decompensation occurs suddenly (not progressively over a course of hours).  In addition, urinary symptoms, confusion, and high fevers are unexpected in this condition. $ Educational objective Acute respiratory distress syndrome is caused by injury of the pulmonary epithelium and/or endothelium, and occurs most often due to sepsis or pneumonia.  Cytokines recruit neutrophils to the lung tissue, which cause capillary damage and leakage of protein-rich fluid into the alveoli.  Later, cellular proliferation and collagen deposition occurs, and in some patients, this leads to irreversible pulmonary fibrosis.",

This lipoprotein complex is released from the lamellar bodies by exocytosis into the alveolar spaces, where the lamellar contents unravel into a structured array called tubular myelin.  This lattice network adsorbs to the air-liquid interface of the alveoli and spreads along the alveolar lining, forming a surfactant film.

They secrete club cell secretory protein (which protects against airway inflammation and oxidative stress) and surfactant components (which prevent bronchiolar collapse). $ (Choice D)  Goblet cells secrete mucin to help with mucociliary clearance.  They are present in the epithelial lining of the trachea and bronchi but are not present in the more distal airways (ie, terminal bronchioles, respiratory bronchioles, alveoli). $ (Choice E)  @Type I pneumocytes@ constitute over 95% of the surface area of the alveoli.  These end-differentiated squamous cells are not a major source of alveolar fluid secretory products. $ (Choice F)  Type II pneumocytes secrete the major components of pulmonary surfactant, including phospholipids such as dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine and surfactant-associated proteins. $ Educational objective Alveolar fluid contains proteases (eg, elastases) that are derived from alveolar macrophages and infiltrating neutrophils.  These proteases can cause destruction of terminal lung parenchyma (eg, emphysema) when secreted in excess (or if left unchecked by deficient antiprotease activity).",

PSP is nontraumatic and is found in patients without preexisting pulmonary disease (eg, cystic fibrosis). It occurs when a large change in the alveolar or intrapleural pressure results in a break in the visceral pleura and subsequent trapping of air between the parietal and visceral spaces. The superficial alveoli in the apices experience greater pressure changes (due to the weight of the lungs pulling down on the apical tissue), predisposing them to the formation of #subpleural blebs#. The blebs then can spontaneously rupture through the visceral pleura, frequently while the patient is at rest. $Tall, thin males around the age of 20 are most commonly affected. Although the most important risk factor is #smoking#, taller individuals also appear to be at higher risk due to more negative intrapleural pressure in the lung apices. $#(Choice B)# Centriacinar emphysema occurs as the larger proximal bronchioles are destroyed, usually as a result of exposure to tobacco smoke in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It predominantly affects the upper lung lobe and initially spares the superficial alveoli. $#(Choice C)# Compensatory hyperinflation results when normal lung parenchyma expands in response to loss of adjacent lung volume (eg, segmental/lobar collapse or surgical removal). PSP results in collapse of adjacent lung tissue due to extrinsic compression by intrapleural air and does not result in parenchymal expansion. $#(Choice D)# Obstructive hyperinflation occurs when a lung segment expands due to a partial obstruction (eg, bronchogenic carcinoma) of the airway supplying it.

His advanced age, multiple comorbidities, and partial immune suppression secondary to chronic oral corticosteroid use also place him at risk for reactivation disease. $Primary tuberculosis infection occurs following inhalation of aerosolized #Mycobacterium tuberculosis#. The organisms are deposited in the lower lungs and phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages, where they proliferate until the macrophages are activated by TH1 lymphocytes. The infection can be subsequently eliminated if the area of involvement is small enough. However, larger regions of caseating necrosis become walled off, allowing #M tuberculosis# to survive in a dormant state without causing disease or symptoms. Later in life (usually following immunosuppression by drugs or HIV) the bacteria can #reactivate# and establish infection in the #upper lungs# (particularly the apex). The predilection for upper lung regions may be related to decreased lymphatic flow or increased oxygen tension. The organisms multiply in the apices, causing caseous and liquefactive necrosis and extensive #cavitary disease#. Erosion into the pulmonary vessels can result in severe hemoptysis. Hematogenous dissemination may also occur, causing miliary or extrapulmonary (eg, Potts disease, tuberculous meningitis) tuberculosis. $#(Choice A)# Primary tuberculosis infection often begins as a focal lesion in the mid-to-lower lungs (Ghon focus). #M tuberculosis# then spreads lymphatically to the hilar lymph nodes, forming a Ghon complex. The organisms can remain dormant in a walled-off Ghon complex for many years before reactivating. Alternatively, the lesion may heal, forming a benign, calcified Ranke complex that is not associated with reactivation tuberculosis. $#(Choice B)# A Ghon complex forms during primary tuberculosis infection and consists of a Ghon focus and hilar lymphadenopathy. This patient's upper lung involvement and cavitary lesion are more characteristic of secondary (reactivation) tuberculosis. Healing of this lesion would result in a persistent cavity that may become secondarily infected with Aspergillus flavus and form fungus balls. $#(Choice D)# #M tuberculosis# is a facultative intracellular bacterium that can survive and multiply within macrophages; as a result, circulating antibodies cannot bind it to promote phagocytosis or complement-mediated killing. Therefore, humoral immunity plays no role in the control of #M tuberculosis#. $#(Choice E)# A negative skin tuberculin test after #M tuberculosis# exposure suggests anergy against tuberculosis antigens and a weak cell-mediated immune response. This can occur in the setting of HIV, sarcoidosis, and other illnesses. $#Educational objective# Primary tuberculosis causes the formation of Ghon foci in the lower lungs.

These findings suggest #systemic sclerosis# (ie, scleroderma), specifically the @limited cutaneous@ variant, or #CREST# (Calcinosis cutis, Raynaud phenomenon, Esophageal dysmotility, Sclerodactyly, Telangiectasia) syndrome. $Systemic sclerosis frequently involves multisystem vasculopathy affecting several vessel beds, including distal extremities (digital ischemia), kidneys (renal crisis), and pulmonary arteries. #Pulmonary arterial hypertension# (PAH), a leading cause of mortality in patients with systemic sclerosis, is driven by abnormal inflammatory and fibroproliferative signaling (eg, transforming growth factor beta), leading to neointimal/medial thickening and luminal narrowing. Histologically, vessels have a concentric onion-skin, sclerotic appearance. $Pulmonary vascular remodeling is progressive and relentless. Over time, the right ventricle cannot pump against the increased afterload, leading to #right ventricular failure#. In this patient, PAH is suggested by a prominent pulmonic component of S2 (ie, #loud P2#, reflecting high pressure in pulmonary artery) with signs of right-sided venous congestion (eg, hepatomegaly, lower extremity edema). $#(Choice A)# Systemic sclerosis can induce extrapulmonary restriction via chest wall skin tightening that limits thoracic expansion. Clear lungs are expected on auscultation and imaging; however, pulmonary function testing would show a restrictive pattern (ie, low FVC). $#(Choice B)# Fibrotic interstitial lung disease is another @pulmonary complication@ of systemic sclerosis (particularly the diffuse cutaneous variant), characterized by lung parenchymal inflammation and collagen deposition. However, inspiratory crackles, reticular interstitial thickening on chest x-ray, and a restrictive pattern on pulmonary function testing are expected. $#(Choice C)# Pericardial fibrosis, occasionally a complication of systemic sclerosis, typically manifests as right-sided heart failure due to impaired diastolic filling of the right ventricle. However, this impaired filling prevents elevation of pulmonary artery pressure; therefore, a loud P2 is not expected. $#(Choice E)# Pulmonic stenosis can lead to right-sided heart failure. However, right ventricular outflow obstruction leads to low pulmonary artery pressures, resulting in a soft P2. In addition, pulmonic stenosis (almost always a congenital lesion) does not explain the additional findings of CREST syndrome. $#Educational objective# Pulmonary arterial hypertension, a vascular complication of systemic sclerosis, involves fibroproliferative remodeling of the vessel wall, leading to increased pulmonary vascular resistance and right-sided heart failure.",

  "explanation_2": "$This patient from Southeast Asia has weight loss, cough, and an apical infiltrate with acid-fast bacilli, raising strong suspicion for #pulmonary tuberculosis#.  Mycobacterium tuberculosis is transmitted to the lungs via aerosolized droplets.  It initially replicates in an @unchecked fashion@ within the alveoli and alveolar macrophages due to virulence factors (eg, cord factor) that prevent macrophage-mediated destruction.  After a few weeks, infected macrophages in the draining lymphatic system display mycobacterial antigens on major histocompatibility complex @(MHC) class II@ molecules, leading to the #stimulation of CD4 T lymphocytes#. $Stimulated CD4 cells #release interferon-gamma# that activates macrophages, greatly increasing their ability to kill phagocytized organisms.  Activated macrophages can also differentiate into epithelioid histiocytes and coalesce into #multinucleated Langhans giant cells# that wall off mycobacteria within granulomas.  The center of the granuloma is acidic and hypoxic, which causes it to appear acellular, necrotic, and \"cheese-like\" (#caseating#).  Granulomas typically limit mycobacterial proliferation but do not fully eliminate the infection. $Although Langhans giant cells are an important component of the immunologic response to pulmonary tuberculosis, they are a nonspecific finding that may also be present in other chronic infectious or inflammatory conditions (eg, sarcoidosis, Crohn disease). $#(Choice A)#  Some intracellular bacterial pathogens (eg, Listeria, Rickettsia) have virulence factors that allow them to escape the phagosome and replicate within the cytosol.  These pathogens are primarily processed by the proteasome (rather than the lysosome), leading to the display of bacterial protein fragments on @MHC class I molecules@.  MHC class I molecules stimulate cytotoxic T cells (CD8 lymphocytes).  In contrast, phagocytosed bacteria that remain within the phagosome (eg, M tuberculosis) are broken down by the lysosome and displayed on MHC class II molecules, which activate CD4, not CD8, cells. $#(Choice B)#  Epstein-Barr virus attacks B lymphocytes and leads to long-term, latent infection that is typically asymptomatic but can occasionally lead to B-lymphocyte malignant transformation.  Although malignant transformation can cause large, atypical cells, acid-fast bacilli would not be seen on culture. $#(Choice C)#  Fibroblast proliferation and collagen production contribute to caseating granuloma formation but do not cause macrophage activation, which is necessary for the formation of multinucleated Langhans giant cells. $#(Choice D)#  Neutrophils (polymorphonuclear cells) have multilobed nuclei that would be visible at this magnification.  Neutrophils play a major role in early inflammation and elimination of extracellular bacterial pathogens (eg, Staphylococcus aureus).  However, they are not the primary effector cell in the elimination of facultative intracellular pathogens such as M tuberculosis. $#Educational objective# Mycobacterium tuberculosis triggers CD4 T lymphocytes to release interferon-gamma, which leads to macrophage activation (improves intracellular killing ability) and differentiation into epithelioid histiocytes.  These cells, along with horseshoe-shaped, multinucleated Langhans giant cells (fused, activated macrophages) are a key component of granuloma formation. ",

An allergen is an antigen that promotes a robust immune response only in a subset of the population. $On initial exposure to allergen, a patient who will eventually develop an allergic response will undergo antibody class switching to #IgE# in B lymphocytes specific for these allergens.  Antigen-specific IgE produced by plasma cells binds to IgE receptors on basophils in the blood and mast cells in the tissues.  When the relevant antigen (allergen) interacts with cell bound-specific IgE, these antibodies will @cross-link@, causing degranulation and release of chemical mediators (histamine, prostaglandin, leukotrienes) responsible for systemic vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, bronchoconstriction, and hemodynamic instability. $#(Choice A)#  Antibody-antigen complex deposition in the vasculature occurs with @Type III hypersensitivity@ reactions (eg, serum sickness, Arthus reaction). $#(Choice B)#  Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity occurs in @type II hypersensitivity@ reactions wherein IgM or IgG binds to antigens expressed on the cell surface.

This pathway plays a role in the damage associated with Type II and III hypersensitivity reactions.  IgM is the antibody most efficient at initiating the classical complement cascade because it circulates as a pentamer (allows for increased complement interaction). $#Educational objective# Type I hypersensitivity reactions are mediated by the interaction of allergen with preexisting IgE bound to basophils and mast cells.

The biopsy specimen with multiple, #noncaseating granulomas#—characterized by a central collection of tightly clustered epithelioid macrophages with abundant pink cytoplasm surrounded by a rim of mononuclear cells—confirms the diagnosis.  Multinucleated giant cells, formed by macrophage fusion, are discernable at higher magnification. $Sarcoidosis is thought to result from a dysregulated cell-mediated immune response to an unidentified antigen, which causes the formation of granulomas.  Cell-mediated immunity is stimulated by production of #IL-12# from activated antigen-presenting cells.  IL-12 stimulates #CD4+ helper T cells# to @differentiate@ into the #Th1 subtype#.  Th1 cells then secrete #IL-2# and #interferon-γ# (IFN-γ).  IL-2 stimulates the autocrine proliferation of Th1 cells and furthers Th1 recruitment.  IFN-γ activates #macrophages #and promotes granuloma formation.  Activated macrophages and T cells also produce #tumor necrosis factor-alpha#, further assisting in leukocyte recruitment and granuloma maintenance. $#(Choice B)#  Th1 cells are central to cell-mediated immunity.  However, IL-5 is a product of Th2 cells.  Moreover, IL-10 is a cytokine involved in the downregulation of immune responses. $#(Choices C, D, and E)#  Th2 cells are involved in humoral immunity and defense against extracellular parasites.  Asthma, a Th2-driven disease, causes dyspnea and cough but is not associated with granuloma formation.  Cytokines involved with asthma include IL-4 and IL-5, which are secreted by Th2 cells.  IL-4 promotes B-cell class switching to form IgE antibodies, and IL-5 promotes eosinophil production and activation.  IL-3 is also involved in asthma (as it promotes survival of mast cells) but mainly supports the growth and differentiation of bone marrow stem cells. $#Educational objective# Sarcoidosis is characterized by noncaseating granulomas due to dysregulated cell-mediated immunity.  Activated antigen-presenting cells produce IL-12, which stimulates the differentiation of Th1-type CD4+ cells.  Th1 cells produce IL-2 and interferon-γ, which stimulate Th1 cell proliferation and macrophage activation, respectively.  ",

  "explanation_2": "$#Mycobacterium tuberculosis# is transmitted by aerosolized droplets from a patient with active pulmonary tuberculosis.  Initially, the pathogen replicates in an unchecked fashion due to virulence factors (eg, cord factor) that allow the bacteria to escape destruction within the phagolysosomes of alveolar macrophages.  After a few weeks, antigen-presenting cells in the draining lymphatic system display mycobacterial antigens on major histocompatibility complex class II molecules and release #interleukin-12#, which differentiates #naïve CD4 cells# into T-helper subtype-1 (#Th1#) cells. $Th1 cells migrate to the sites of infection and secrete #interferon-gamma#, resulting in the #activation of macrophages#.  Activated macrophages are able to form fully mature phagolysosomes to destroy intracellular mycobacteria.  They also differentiate into cells (eg, epithelioid, Langhans giant cells) that surround extracellular mycobacteria and form granulomas.  Granulomas have an acidic, hypoxic central environment that limits the proliferation of mycobacteria but does not usually eliminate the infection. $Because the cell-mediated response to M tuberculosis takes several weeks to form, recently exposed patients frequently have a negative initial tuberculin skin test (as in this patient).  Although most patients with primary tuberculosis have no symptoms and no chest x-ray findings, after several months, a Ranke complex (calcified lower lobe nodule and ipsilateral hilar lymph node) can often be seen on x-ray. $#(Choice A)#  Facultative, intracellular organisms such as M tuberculosis are protected from antibodies and complement when within cells.  As a result, elimination of these pathogens does not primarily rely on the humoral immune system (eg, B lymphocytes). $#(Choice C)#  Neutrophils are a crucial immune component for control of most extracellular bacterial infections (eg, Streptococcus pneumoniae).  However, macrophages are the more important effector cells for control of M tuberculosis and many other intracellular bacterial infections. $#(Choice D)#  Intracellular organisms that replicate in the cytosol, such as viruses or certain intracellular bacteria (eg, Listeria), are processed by the proteasome and displayed on major histocompatibility complex @(MHC) class I molecules@.  This leads to the activation of CD8 T lymphocytes.  M tuberculosis primarily replicates within the phagosome (not the cytosol), leading to display of mycobacterial antigens on MHC class II molecules and the subsequent activation of CD4, rather than CD8, cells. $#(Choice E)#  Natural killer cells are cytotoxic lymphocytes that can recognize damaged or infected cells without requiring MHC activation.  They are important for clearing viral infections and for tumor immunosurveillance, but are not the primary effector cell in tuberculosis infection. $#Educational objective# Mycobacterium tuberculosis primarily replicates within the phagosome, leading to display of mycobacterial antigens on major histocompatibility complex class II molecules.  This results in the activation of CD4 cells and subsequent control of the infection with macrophages.",

  "explanation_2": "#Asthma# is a complex disease involving both chronic inflammation and airway hyperreactivity.  #Inhaled corticosteroids# (eg, fluticasone, budesonide) are a mainstay of asthma therapy.  Corticosteroids reduce inflammation by inhibiting nuclear transcription of inflammatory genes (in part leading to downregulation of the enzyme @phospholipase A2@) to decrease the production of leukotrienes and other inflammatory mediators. $Although corticosteroids have no direct effect on bronchodilation, these drugs provide an additional benefit in asthma by #potentiating the bronchodilatory effect# of beta-2 agonists (eg, albuterol).  This is accomplished by stimulating the #upregulation of beta-2 receptors# in #bronchial smooth muscle#, increasing cellular responsiveness to adrenergic stimulus.  This medication effect is similar to the permissive effect of endogenous cortisol on blood pressure, which involves upregulation of alpha-1 receptors and increased responsiveness of vascular smooth muscle cells to epinephrine. $#(Choice A)#  Corticosteroids increase, rather than decrease, the production of lung surfactants and may be used to help prevent infant respiratory distress syndrome in premature infants. $#(Choice B)#  Guaifenesin reduces the viscosity (ie, thickness) of respiratory tract mucus and is often used in the symptomatic management of viral upper respiratory tract infections.  Decreased mucus viscosity is not a direct effect of corticosteroids. $#(Choice C)#  Theophylline provides benefit in asthma by stimulating bronchodilation via inhibition of phosphodiesterase-3 and may also create an anti-inflammatory effect via inhibition of phosphodiesterase-4.  Corticosteroids may somewhat decrease phosphodiesterase activity but likely do not have a significant effect. $#(Choice D)#  Omalizumab is a monoclonal antibody that treats asthma by binding to free IgE to decrease IgE binding to surface receptors on mast cells and basophils.  This inhibits the degranulation of inflammatory mediators.  The anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroids may also contribute to a decrease, rather than an increase, in surface-bound IgE. $#Educational objective# Corticosteroids (eg, fluticasone, budesonide) have multiple beneficial effects in the treatment of asthma.  In addition to their anti-inflammatory effect, corticosteroids upregulate beta-2 receptors on bronchial smooth muscle to increase cellular responsiveness to adrenergic stimuli and potentiate the bronchodilatory response to inhaled beta-2 agonists (eg, albuterol).

Diagnosis is usually made when chest imaging reveals a dense fluid collection or cavitary infiltrate (often with an #air-fluid level#) in dependent portions of the lung (eg, superior portion of lower lobe). $Treatment with ampicillin/sulbactam or a carbapenem is considered first-line therapy due to excellent coverage of oral anaerobes and aerobic gram-positive organisms (eg, Streptococcus pneumoniae).

Patients frequently have subacute cough and low-grade fever, but chest imaging usually demonstrates bilateral reticulo-nodular opacities.  The presence of foul-smelling sputum and a cavitary infiltrate with an air-fluid level makes lung abscess much more likely. $#(Choice B)#  Although gram-negative intestinal flora (eg, Klebsiella pneumoniae) can cause lung abscess, empiric treatment must also target upper respiratory anaerobic organisms because they are present in most lung abscesses. $#(Choice C)#  Skin flora (eg, coagulase-negative staphylococci) are common causes of blood culture contaminants, but they do not typically cause pulmonary infection. $#(Choice D)#  Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus can cause hospital-acquired or post–viral pneumonia complicated by lung abscess formation.  However, purulent, foul-smelling sputum is highly indicative of anaerobic involvement; in addition, S aureus is a less common cause of lung abscess in patients at high risk for aspiration (eg, alcohol/drug use). $#Educational objective# Patients with alcohol use disorder are at increased risk for lung abscess due to the aspiration of oral flora during periods of unconsciousness.

A peripheral nerve is stimulated 4 times in quick succession and the muscular response is recorded.  The height of each bar represents the strength of each twitch; higher bars indicate the activation of increasing numbers of individual muscle fibers (myocytes). $When a #nondepolarizing NMJ blocker# (eg, vecuronium) is administered, competitive inhibition of postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors at the motor endplate prevents some of these fibers from activating, decreasing the strength of the twitch.  TOF stimulation shows a #progressive reduction# in each of the 4 responses (fading pattern) as a result of less acetylcholine being released with each subsequent impulse (due to the additional effect of presynaptic acetylcholine receptor blockade).  In contrast, #depolarizing blockers# (eg, #succinylcholine#) initially function by preventing repolarization of the motor endplate and show #equal reduction# of all 4 twitches during TOF stimulation #(phase I blockade)#.  The responses remain equal because the presynaptic acetylcholine receptor stimulation helps to mobilize presynaptic acetylcholine vesicles for release.  Persistent exposure to succinylcholine results in eventual transition to #phase II blockade# as the acetylcholine receptors become desensitized and inactivated (ie, functionally similar to nondepolarizing blockade). $Succinylcholine is commonly administered for #rapid-sequence intubation# due to its rapid onset (<1 minute).  The duration of action is determined by its metabolism by plasma cholinesterase and is typically <10 minutes.  However, some patients are homozygous for an atypical plasma cholinesterase, which breaks down succinylcholine more slowly.  In these patients, the paralysis can last for #hours# and they must be maintained on mechanical ventilation until spontaneous respirations resume. $#(Choice A)#  Dantrolene relaxes skeletal muscle by reducing the release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.  Dantrolene is used to treat malignant hyperthermia and neuroleptic malignant syndrome.  It is not routinely used as a neuromuscular paralytic agent. $#(Choice B)#  Benzodiazepines are effective for sedation, but they have no direct action at the NMJ and do not provide sufficient muscle paralysis to facilitate intubation. $#(Choices C and E)#  Pancuronium and tubocurarine are nondepolarizing NMJ blockers.  Unlike depolarizing NMJ drugs, these agents do not function in distinct phases and their TOF responses always display a fading pattern.  Neostigmine administration reverses nondepolarizing NMJ blockade. $#Educational objective# Succinylcholine is a fast-acting, depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent used for rapid-sequence intubation that causes equal reduction of all 4 twitches during train-of-four stimulation (phase I blockade).  Prolonged administration of succinylcholine or use in patients with abnormal plasma cholinesterase activity causes transition to a phase II (nondepolarizing) block, seen as a progressive reduction in each of the 4 twitches.

Therefore, #classic opioid adverse effects# (eg, constipation, respiratory depression, analgesia, sedation) are #not seen# at therapeutic doses.  This favorable pharmacologic profile makes DXM a first-choice agent for cough suppression. $However, DXM also increases serotonin activity in the CNS by decreasing the rate of presynaptic serotonin reuptake and directly stimulating serotonin receptors.  For this reason, DXM abuse can cause #serotonin syndrome#, manifesting as muscular hypertonia, spasticity (eg, clonus, hyperreflexia), autonomic instability (eg, hyperthermia, hypertension), and encephalopathy.

  "explanation_2": "This hemodynamically unstable patient has severe #bronchospasm# and impending respiratory failure and requires intubation.  Prior to intubation, anesthesia must be induced.  Three medications are commonly used because of their rapid onset of action and short duration of effect. $• #Propofol:# A highly lipophilic GABA agonist that may be used for #long-term sedation#.  Disadvantages include vasodilation, which can result in #hypotension# and an increase in serum triglycerides and lipase. $• #Etomidate:# A GABA agonist that has the advantage of being the most #hemodynamically neutral#.  It does not cause changes in heart rate, blood pressure, or cardiac output.  However, it inhibits cortisol synthesis, which can lead to (reversible) #adrenocortical suppression#.  Because of this, it is often avoided in patients with septic shock, and it should not be used as maintenance of sedation after induction. $• #Ketamine:# An N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist that is similar to PCP; it #preserves the respiratory drive# during induction of anesthesia.  In contrast to propofol and etomidate, it also provides an analgesic effect.  Ketamine stimulates the release of catecholamines (ie, #sympathomimetic#), which can cause #bronchodilation# but also increase the heart rate, myocardial contractility, and cerebral blood flow, potentially putting the patient at risk for cardiovascular events or increased intracranial pressure. $In this patient with an acute asthma attack, #ketamine #was likely chosen because it stimulates release of catecholamines that increase sympathomimetic activity and may #improve bronchospasm#. $#(Choice A)#  Propofol and etomidate are both GABA agonists, but ketamine works at the NMDA receptor. $#(Choice B)#  Both ketamine and etomidate are much less lipophilic than propofol. $#(Choice C)#  Both ketamine and etomidate are metabolized primarily by the liver.  Propofol is also metabolized by the liver, but the effect is terminated by its redistribution rather than metabolism. $#(Choice D)#  Neuromuscular blockade is often used to facilitate intubation.  None of the three commonly used induction anesthetics cause significant neuromuscular blockade, so an additional medication (eg, succinylcholine, rocuronium) is used if needed. $#Educational objective# Ketamine can be used for anesthesia induction.  The side effects of increased catecholamine release (eg, bronchodilation) are often exploited in patients with bronchospasm.  "

  "explanation_2": "$Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction is common in patients with underlying #asthma#.  Asthma occurs due to a complex inflammatory response to the environment that involves Th2 lymphocytes, eosinophils, and mast cells.  Eosinophils and mast cells synthesize and release #leukotrienes#, which are inflammatory mediators that induce bronchial smooth muscle contraction #(bronchoconstriction)#, bronchial #mucus secretion#, and bronchial #edema#.  The leukotrienes mainly responsible for these responses are the cysteinyl-containing leukotrienes such as leukotriene C4, D4, and E4. $#Leukotriene receptor antagonists# (eg, montelukast, zafirlukast) effectively treat asthma by binding to leukotriene receptors on bronchial smooth muscle cells and blocking the effects of cysteinyl-containing leukotrienes. $#(Choice A)#  Albuterol causes short-acting bronchodilation via selective stimulation of beta 2 receptors.  It is typically used as an as-needed rescue inhaler in patients with asthma. $#(Choice B)#  Dextromethorphan suppresses cough via stimulation of sigma opioid receptors in the CNS (it does not stimulate mu or delta opioid receptors and therefore does not cause other typical opioid effects).  It is commonly used in cold medication but is not effective for treatment of asthma. $#(Choice C)#  Inhaled corticosteroids (eg, fluticasone, budesonide) help treat asthma by inhibiting nuclear transcription of inflammatory genes leading to widespread anti-inflammatory effects.  One effect is reduced activity of the enzyme phospholipase A2 to decrease the production of leukotrienes.  Corticosteroids do not block cell surface receptors. $#(Choice D)#  Ipratropium stimulates bronchodilation via blockade of the binding of acetylcholine (a neurotransmitter) to muscarinic receptors.  Inhaled ipratropium is sometimes used in the treatment of asthma but is more commonly used for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. $#(Choice F)#  Zileuton is a 5-lipoxygenase enzyme inhibitor that reduces the production of leukotrienes (it does not block leukotriene cell surface receptors).  It can be used for treatment of asthma, but it is often avoided due to concerns about toxicity. $#Educational objective# The cysteinyl-containing leukotrienes (ie, leukotriene C4, D4, and E4) are inflammatory mediators that stimulate bronchoconstriction, bronchial mucus secretion, and bronchial edema to contribute to the pathogenesis of asthma.

As a result, they have an extended duration of action (≥12 hours) but slow onset of action.  #Salmeterol# has a slightly longer duration of action than formoterol due to its ability to bind a #secondary exosite# within the beta-2 receptor, which serves as an anchor to prevent active site dissociation. $• #Short-acting beta-2 agonists# (eg, albuterol, levalbuterol) are typically used for acute symptom relief.  These drugs are relatively hydrophilic, interact minimally with the plasma membrane, and are rapidly metabolized, explaining their rapid onset (minutes) and short duration of action (4-6 hours) #(choices A and C)#. $#(Choice B)#  Isoproterenol is a nonselective beta agonist used primarily for its chronotropic effects in patients with bradycardia or heart block. $#(Choice E)#  Terbutaline is a short-acting beta-2 agonist administered via intravenous or subcutaneous injection for very severe asthma exacerbations (ie, those requiring intubation).  It does not have a long lipophilic side chain. $#Educational objective# Short-acting beta-2 agonists (eg, albuterol, levalbuterol) are hydrophilic and are rapidly metabolized, explaining their rapid onset and short duration of action.  Long-acting beta-2 agonists (eg, salmeterol, formoterol) have a prolonged duration of action due to their lipophilic side chain, which allows them to attach to the cell plasma membrane.  Salmeterol also binds to a secondary exosite within the beta-2 receptor, anchoring the molecule and further prolonging its action.  "

In addition, corticosteroids decrease smooth muscle proliferation and mucus production by goblet cells. $Systemic corticosteroids (eg, oral prednisone) are used in short courses to treat acute asthma exacerbations, whereas inhaled corticosteroids (eg, #fluticasone#) reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations and are used for long-term asthma control in patients with persistent symptoms.  Suppression of airway inflammation is evident within hours of administration but reaches maximal effect after several months of inhaled therapy.  Nonadherence to long-term therapy can increase the risk of life-threatening asthma exacerbation. $#(Choices A and C)#  Albuterol is a selective beta-2 adrenergic agonist that induces bronchodilation.  Acetylcholine released through vagal stimulation mediates bronchoconstriction via muscarinic receptors on bronchial smooth muscle cells; ipratropium is a muscarinic antagonist that promotes bronchodilation and reduced mucus production.  Neither of these agents has anti-inflammatory properties, and although short-acting beta agonists are widely used to provide rapid relief of symptoms during an exacerbation, they do not prevent inflammation-induced airway remodeling or alter the chronic disease course. $#(Choice D)#  Magnesium sulfate inhibits calcium influx into airway smooth muscle and promotes bronchodilation when given intravenously during an acute asthma flare-up.  Magnesium also reduces inflammation by stabilizing T cells and inhibiting mast cell degranulation; however, it is less effective than corticosteroids. $#(Choice E)#  Leukotrienes are potent inducers of airway bronchoconstriction and inflammation.  Leukotriene inhibitors (eg, montelukast) are useful for long-term control in some patients with asthma.  However, they possess less efficacy and have fewer anti-inflammatory properties than inhaled glucocorticoids. $#(Choice F)#  Theophylline, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, results in increased intracellular cyclic AMP, which contributes to its role as a bronchodilator.  Theophylline also has anti-inflammatory effects, although they are far less potent than glucocorticoids. $#Educational objective# Asthma is characterized by chronic airway inflammation, which leads to airway remodeling, airway hyperresponsiveness, and bronchoconstriction.  Corticosteroids reduce airway inflammation and are used for both chronic asthma management (inhaled administration) and acute exacerbations (systemic administration).  "

Symptoms that cannot be related to pulmonary infection, inhalation of irritants, stress, exercise, or aspirin ingestion should raise suspicion for #atopic (extrinsic) asthma#.  Atopic asthma occurs in genetically predisposed individuals; patients often have a family history of asthma, allergies, or eczema.  Sputum microscopy classically demonstrates elevated levels of @eosinophils@ (granule-containing cells) with @Charcot-Leyden crystals@ (bipyramidal-shaped accumulations of eosinophil membrane protein). $Atopic asthma occurs due to an excessive #TH2-mediated# reaction to environmental aero-antigens (eg, pollen, pet dander).  In response to allergic stimuli, these cells secrete #IL-5#, a critical cytokine for #eosinophilic activation#, #recruitment#, and #prolonged survival# in the bronchial mucosa.  TH2 cells also synthesize IL-4, which stimulates IgE formation by plasma cells.  As with other type I hypersensitivity reactions, these antigen-specific antibodies bind to receptors on mast cells, and repeated exposure induces mast cell degranulation.  This leads to bronchoconstriction, increased vascular permeability, and increased mucus production associated with acute asthma exacerbations.  Eosinophils also release inflammatory mediators (ie, major basic protein, eosinophil cationic protein) that damage the bronchial epithelium later in the immune response. $#(Choice A)#  Although IL-1 release from macrophages is involved in asthma pathogenesis, it is not a specific cytokine.  IL-1 release is a component of almost all inflammatory processes and does not necessarily cause eosinophil infiltration. $#(Choice C)#  IL-12 functions to promote the differentiation of TH1 cells; it is not directly involved in eosinophil recruitment. $#(Choice D)#  Interferon-gamma is secreted by helper T cells and functions to activate macrophages, thereby promoting adaptive immunity against intracellular pathogens.  It is not directly chemotactic for eosinophils. $#(Choice E)#  Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) is a growth factor involved in tissue regeneration and repair; high levels are associated with subepithelial fibrosis and airway remodeling seen in chronic asthma.  However, it is not chemotactic for eosinophils. $#Educational objective# Paroxysmal breathlessness and wheezing in a young patient that are unrelated to ingestion of aspirin, pulmonary infection, inhalation of irritants, and/or exercise should raise a strong suspicion for atopic (extrinsic) asthma.

ARDS involves an inflammatory response in the lungs that leads to @alveolar capillary leakage@ and diffuse pulmonary edema; the edema prevents ventilation of affected alveoli and facilitates alveolar collapse, leading to increased intrapulmonary shunting (perfusion without ventilation).  In addition, @functional residual capacity@ (FRC) (ie, the volume of air in the lungs at end-tidal expiration) is reduced. $#Mechanical ventilation# is typically needed for the management of ARDS because it allows for the application of #positive end-expiratory pressure# (PEEP).  PEEP helps treat ARDS by #opening collapsed alveoli# to reduce intrapulmonary shunting #(choice D)# and #increase FRC# back to near-normal levels.  The increase in FRC has the following beneficial effects: $• There is a critical lung capacity (ie, closing capacity) at which some of the lung's small airways collapse during expiration (due to decreased radial traction at lower lung volumes).  When FRC drops below this critical capacity, alveoli supplied by the collapsed airways are without ventilation for part of the respiratory cycle, which contributes to intrapulmonary shunting and increases ventilation-perfusion mismatching.  Increasing FRC minimizes the time spent below @closing capacity@ and in doing so #decreases ventilation-perfusion mismatching#. $• Because the FRC air volume remains in the lungs throughout the respiratory cycle, it acts as a store of oxygen that the body can pull from during brief periods of increased need.  Therefore, increasing FRC #increases the oxygen reserves# in the lungs. $#(Choice A)#  PEEP increases, rather than decreases, alveolar pressure, which has the negative effect of increasing the risk of pulmonary barotrauma. $#(Choice B)#  Intrapleural pressure is normally negative throughout the respiratory cycle due to the opposing elasticity of the lungs (tend to collapse) and chest wall (tends to expand).  Increased end-expiratory airway pressure during PEEP reduces the collapsing force of the lungs, causing the intrapleural pressure to increase. $#(Choice E)#  Minute ventilation is determined by the product of tidal volume and respiratory rate.  PEEP causes breathing to occur at a higher baseline lung volume (ie, higher FRC), but tidal volume and respiratory rate are not directly affected, and minute ventilation is unchanged. $#Educational objective# Positive end-expiratory pressure helps treat acute respiratory distress syndrome by opening collapsed alveoli to reduce intrapulmonary shunting and increase functional residual capacity (FRC).

Afterward, there is a @gradual decline@ in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of approximately 25 mL/year.  In the average person who #smokes tobacco#, the rate of lung #function declines# approximately #3 times faster#. $Cigarette smoke contains numerous toxins (eg, formaldehyde, acrolein) that provoke# inflammatory proteolytic damage# to the airways and alveoli.

Together these conditions lead to expiratory flow limitation, typically measured as a# reduction in FEV1#. $Once lost, lung function is not recoverable.  However, smoking #cessation# can markedly #slow the decline# in FEV1.  Within a year of complete abstinence, a successful quitter's rate of FEV1 decline returns to that of normally aging nonsmokers.  Therefore, after this patient quits smoking, the slope of his FEV1 decline curve will decrease, but no function will be regained.  This trajectory is best represented by #Curve C#. $#(Choices A and B)#  FEV1 declines persistently with age in all individuals past age 30.

Smoking cessation does not restore lung function that has already been lost.  However, it slows the decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second, restoring its trajectory to that of normally aging nonsmokers.  ",

Invasion of surrounding structures can cause the following: $• #Shoulder pain# radiating toward the axilla and scapula (#most common# presenting symptom).  It occurs due to involvement of the lower brachial plexus.  Other associated symptoms include arm paresthesia, weakness, and muscle atrophy. $• #Horner syndrome# occurs due to involvement of the cervical sympathetic ganglia.  Symptoms include ipsilateral ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis. $• Upper extremity edema may be due to compression of subclavian vessels. $• #Spinal cord compression# and paraplegia can result from tumor extension into the intervertebral foramina. $#(Choice A)#  Squamous cell carcinoma is associated with parathyroid-related peptide secretion and hypercalcemia.  Cushing syndrome and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion can accompany small cell carcinoma of the lung. $#(Choice B)#  Centrally located lung cancers (squamous cell and small cell carcinomas) frequently obstruct the main bronchi, producing dyspnea and cough.

  "explanation_2": "This patient's presentation is consistent with #pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP)#, a rare condition characterized by progressive respiratory dysfunction due to the #accumulation of surfactant# debris within alveolar spaces.  Surfactant is a lipoproteinaceous material that appears pink with #periodic acid–Schiff# staining; it forms concentrically laminated structures (ie, #lamellar bodies#) that can be seen on electron microscopy. $PAP is caused by an imbalance between surfactant production and clearance.  In healthy lungs, surfactant is secreted by type 2 pneumocytes and eventually cleared by #alveolar macrophages#.  In PAP, surfactant removal is impaired due to compromised alveolar macrophage function (eg, usually because of defects in granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor #[GM-CSF]# signaling). $Treatment involves therapeutic whole-lung lavage to wash away surfactant and inhaled GM-CSF replacement therapy. $#(Choice B)#  Ciliated epithelial cells line the conducting airways and are responsible for mucociliary escalator function, a key process in airway clearance.  Primary ciliary dyskinesia (eg, Kartagener syndrome) is characterized by impaired ciliary function and leads to mucostasis, recurrent pneumonia, and bronchiectasis. $#(Choice C)#  Club cells (bronchiolar cells) are located at the bronchoalveolar alveolar junction and protect and repair the distal airway (terminal bronchioles).  Club cell dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of COPD. $#(Choice D)#  Fibroblasts produce and maintain the connective tissue matrix of the lung, lending structural support and elasticity.  Loss of fibroblast function contributes to degenerative airspace dilation in emphysema. $#(Choice E)#  Type 1 pneumocytes form the alveolar gas-exchanging surface.  Rapid destruction and loss of type 1 pneumocytes occurs in early acute lung injury.  It does not result in the abnormal accumulation of surfactant products. $#Educational objective# Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is a rare condition characterized by progressive respiratory dysfunction due to the accumulation of surfactant (periodic acid–Schiff positive material forming lamellar bodies) within the alveolar spaces.  The condition occurs most often due to the impaired clearance of surfactant by alveolar macrophages (eg, decreased granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor signaling).  "

  "explanation_2": "$This patient has intermittent vague #respiratory symptoms#, including dyspnea, wheezing, and chest tightness.  His symptoms developed a few months after he started a new industrial painting job and #regressed after sustained absence# from the workplace (eg, vacation).  This correlation is suspicious for #occupational asthma# (OA), a common form of adult-onset asthma. $Like other forms of asthma, OA involves airway inflammation with leukocyte-induced bronchoconstriction.  The underlying trigger may be immunologic or nonimmunologic: $• Immunologic OA (IgE-dependent, T-helper 2–mediated) involves exposure to #workplace aeroallergens# (eg, isocyanates in painters, grain proteins in bakers).  It often has a #latent period# of several months as the patient becomes sensitized to the allergen. $• Nonimmunologic OA (IgE-independent, irritant-induced) involves inhalation of noxious compounds (eg, chlorine, ammonia) that induce airway irritation and mast cell degranulation.  This typically occurs after large accidental exposures (eg, chemical spill); symptom onset is sudden. $#Normal spirometry# without obstruction (ie, normal FEV1/FVC ratio >0.7) #does not exclude# asthma, as asthmatic bronchoconstriction may be intermittent.  Outside of an attack, patients may be relatively asymptomatic with normal pulmonary function tests. $#(Choice B)#  Coccidioidomycosis is endemic to the southwestern United States.  It presents as fungal pneumonia (eg, fever, chest pain) often with extrapulmonary manifestations (eg, arthralgia, erythema nodosum).  In addition, chest imaging typically reveals pulmonary infiltrates and hilar adenopathy, and this patient's symptoms emerged before his trip to Arizona. $#(Choice C)#  Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, an inherited disorder, causes premature-onset emphysema out of proportion to smoking history.  Patients have dyspnea, cough, and wheezing.  However, imaging typically reveals basilar-predominant bullae, spirometry consistently shows an @obstructive pattern@, and symptoms would not resolve with travel. $#(Choice D)#  BMPR2 gene mutations cause hereditary pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); symptoms include progressive dyspnea and signs of right ventricular pressure overload (eg, peripheral edema, jugulovenous distension).  Because PAH affects the pulmonary vascular system instead of the airways or parenchyma, spirometry would be normal; resolution while traveling would be unexpected. $#(Choice E)#  Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a vasculitis of small- or medium-sized arteries characterized by asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis.  Chest imaging typically demonstrates patchy infiltrates; symptoms would not resolve while traveling. $#Educational objective# Occupational asthma involves airway inflammation and bronchoconstriction triggered by sensitization to a workplace aeroallergen (eg, isocyanates, grain proteins).  Improvement on sustained absence from work (eg, vacation) is an important clinical clue.  Normal spirometry does not exclude asthma because bronchospasm may occur intermittently.  ",

  "explanation_2": "$This patient has #diffuse pulmonary edema# (inspiratory wet crackles, bilateral patchy infiltrates) that can be cardiogenic (eg, decompensated left ventricular failure) or noncardiogenic (eg, acute respiratory distress syndrome).  With pulmonary edema, the #alveoli become flooded# and unable to fill with gas (ventilation: V ≈ 0).  However, they are still being perfused (Q), resulting in many alveoli with ventilation-perfusion @(V/Q) ratios@ approaching zero. $Because blood passing through the lungs returns to the left atrium without being oxygenated, this situation is analogous to a true right-to-left anatomic shunt (eg, atrial septal defect with flow from the right to the left atrium) and is termed #intrapulmonary shunt effect#.  Increasing the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) to 100% does not improve oxygenation because the shunted blood never \"sees\" the alveolar gas.  Therefore, this patient's low arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) has #not corrected with# 100% supplemental #oxygen#. $Because pure oxygen alone cannot improve hypoxemia, treatment depends on reducing the shunt effect.  This can be done by #pressurizing# the inspired gas in a closed circuit (eg, mechanical ventilator).  Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) #reduces the shunt# by propping the collapsed alveoli open, displacing extracellular lung fluid and exposing more alveolar surface area for gas exchange/oxygen uptake. $#(Choice A)#  Anatomical dead space refers to the volume of air in the conducting airways (eg, trachea, bronchi) that never reaches alveoli.  It is increased, not decreased, in an intubated patient due to the extra volume of the ventilator tubing.  At any given tidal volume, increased anatomic dead space causes less air to reach alveoli with each breath, contributing to hypoventilation and worsening hypoxemia. $#(Choice C)#  When fluid enters the alveolar airspace (ie, pulmonary edema), the surface tension increases (due to dilution of surfactant) causing the alveolar walls to cling together and collapse (ie, atelectasis), which decreases lung compliance.  PEEP props open (\"recruits\") the partially flooded alveoli, improving lung compliance. $#(Choices D and E)#  PEEP raises intrathoracic pressure, which compresses pulmonary capillaries and raises pulmonary vascular resistance.  This increases pressure within the right heart chambers and can increase right-to-left shunting through an existing intracardiac shunt (eg, atrial or ventricular septal defect), worsening hypoxemia.  Therefore, PEEP is generally avoided in patients with intracardiac shunts. $#Educational objective# Severe hypoxemia that does not correct with 100% supplemental oxygen is consistent with a right-to-left shunt.  Intrapulmonary shunt effect occurs when an alveolar filling process (eg, diffuse pulmonary edema) causes poor alveolar ventilation despite continued perfusion; this improves with positive end-expiratory pressure.

In addition, there is a characteristic #\"scooped-out\" expiratory pattern# consistent with the reduced expiratory flow rates seen in obstructive lung disease.  This hyperinflation and expiratory airflow obstruction occur in #chronic obstructive pulmonary disease# (COPD).  Airflow obstruction in COPD is partially due to anatomic narrowing of the bronchi (chronic bronchitis).  In addition, decreased lung elasticity resulting from #destruction of interalveolar walls# (emphysema) promotes dynamic compression of the airways during expiration (intrapleural pressure becomes greater than airway pressure), further contributing to expiratory airflow obstruction. $Hyperinflation in COPD also reduces the @inspiratory reserve volume@, limiting the maximal tidal volume.  This is especially true during exercise, when expiration time is limited.  Because patients with COPD require extra time for exhalation, increasing amounts of air can become trapped in the lungs during rapid breathing, leading to further reduction in tidal volume.  This is known as #dynamic hyperinflation# and is believed to be a major cause of dyspnea and exercise limitation in COPD. $#(Choice A)#  Alveolar hyaline membranes are seen in acute respiratory distress syndrome.  The pulmonary edema tends to reduce lung compliance, causing a restrictive flow-volume pattern (purple curve). $#(Choice B)#  Atelectasis due to extrinsic pulmonary compression may occur when the pleural cavity fills with air (ie, pneumothorax) or fluid (eg, exudate, blood).  Lung volumes and total lung compliance are likely reduced under such conditions, producing a restrictive flow-volume pattern. $#(Choice D)#  Diffuse intraalveolar hemorrhage tends to dilute alveolar surfactant, increasing alveolar surface tension and promoting alveolar atelectasis.  These changes would reduce lung volumes and lung compliance, resulting in a restrictive flow-volume pattern. $#(Choice E)#  Pulmonary fibrosis tends to decrease lung volume and compliance, producing a restrictive pattern.  In restrictive diseases, total lung capacity and residual volume are reduced.  The expiratory flow rate is increased relative to the low lung volumes but is reduced compared to normal peak expiratory flow rates. $#(Choice F)#  In pulmonary thromboembolism there is decreased perfusion but minimal effect on ventilation.  Therefore, the flow-volume curve will remain mostly normal. $#Educational objective# The flow-volume loop for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is characterized by increased residual volume and total lung capacity, as well as a \"scooped-out\" expiratory pattern due to reduced expiratory flow rates.

Immediate postmortem analysis of patients with sepsis reveals surprisingly minimal tissue necrosis but, often, extensive mitochondrial damage.  This mitochondrial dysfunction leads to #decreased oxidative phosphorylation# with loss of ATP production.  A compensatory bioenergetic shift toward glycolysis often results in #lactic acidosis#. $• Widespread microcirculatory failure with vasodilation causes blood to shunt rapidly through organs, decreasing the opportunity for oxygen extraction. $• Increased capillary permeability causes tissue edema (third spacing), which increases the diffusion distance for oxygen to reach mitochondria of target cells. $Because oxygen use decreases, the transorgan arteriovenous oxygen gradient is small; therefore, #oxygen saturation of central venous blood# (ScvO2) (superior vena cava) – returning from the periphery – #increases#.

It likely does so by reducing atelectasis of posterior alveoli to reduce intrapulmonary shunting and #improve ventilation-perfusion matching# throughout the lungs. $Because the heart occupies anterior space in the chest cavity, the #majority of lung mass is located posteriorly#.  When a patient is in the supine position (lying face up), the weight of the heart and anterior lung segments compresses the posterior lung segments and limits ventilation of posterior alveoli.  In addition, abdominal organ and tissue mass weighs considerably on the posterior portion of the diaphragm, displacing it cranially and further contributing to compression of the posterior basal lung segments.  The anterior alveoli, subjected to minimal compression and ample ventilation in the supine position, are often hyperinflated, increasing the risk of barotrauma in those regions. $Prone positioning causes the heart and anterior lung mass to rest on the anterior chest wall, #alleviating compression of the posterior lung segments#.  In addition, the freely hanging abdomen #removes pressure on the diaphragm#, allowing the diaphragm to move caudally and further open up collapsed posterior basal alveoli.

In most patients, #CT angiography#, which requires intravenous contrast administration, is the diagnostic test of choice.  However, the contrast used in CT studies should be avoided in patients with chronic kidney disease due to the increased risk of contrast-induced nephropathy; in such patients, a #ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan# is the preferred diagnostic study. $A V/Q scan is a nuclear medicine study that uses a radioactive tracer placed in both inhaled gas and the bloodstream to visualize areas of ventilation and perfusion in the lung.  In patients with PE, ventilation is preserved but the embolus prevents adequate blood perfusion to the affected areas of the lung.  Therefore, the most definitive diagnostic finding for PE on V/Q scan is a large area showing a #perfusion defect without ventilation defect# (mismatched perfusion defect). $#(Choice A)#  The absence of perfusion abnormalities is a useful finding on V/Q scan, as it likely rules out significant PE. $#(Choices B and E)#  @Matched ventilation and perfusion defects@ may result from chronic lung abnormalities (eg, airway inflammation or obstruction, atelectasis) that lead to localized areas of poor ventilation with corresponding hypoxic vasoconstriction, or they may represent a PE that happens to be in an area of poor ventilation.  These results are often inconclusive and necessitate additional testing to confirm or rule out PE. $#(Choice D)#  An area of @ventilation defect without perfusion defect@ is suggestive of conditions that lead to acute alveolar filling (eg, pneumonia, pulmonary edema). $#Educational objective# Ventilation/perfusion scanning can be useful for diagnosing pulmonary embolism.

  "explanation_2": "$The #ΔF508 mutation# in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (#CFTR#) protein is the most common mutation in patients with #cystic fibrosis# (CF).  In unaffected individuals, the CFTR protein serves as a chloride channel that regulates the flow of sodium, chloride, and water across the epithelial membranes of the airways, biliary tree, intestines, sweat ducts, and pancreatic ducts. $Newborn screening for CF is performed in the United States, but positive results should be confirmed by #sweat testing#.  When eccrine sweat is first produced, it is isotonic with extracellular fluid.  As sweat travels through the eccrine duct to the skin's surface, chloride is normally resorbed via CFTR, and sodium and water follow.  CFTR facilitates production of hypotonic sweat in patients without CF.  However, patients with CF are unable to reabsorb chloride and sodium in the eccrine ducts and therefore secrete #sweat with high sodium and chloride# levels. $The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms (lethargy, vomiting) is #hyponatremia due to excessive salt wasting# from his sweat.  Risk factors for hyponatremia in patients with CF include exclusive breast or formula feeding prior to the introduction of sodium-rich, solid foods; exposure to high-temperature environments; and exercise.  Therefore, #salt supplementation# is recommended for patients with CF. $#(Choice A)#  Chloride ions are an important contributor to extracellular fluid volume, and hypochloremia is also very common in patients with CF due to sweat losses.

When a pulmonary infarction does occur, it is typically #hemorrhagic# (red) rather than ischemic (white) due to the relatively low density of lung tissue and the dual blood supply. $#(Choice B)#  Alveolar inflammation triggered by PE can eventually lead to decreased surfactant and some degree of atelectasis.  This process can take up to 2 days to develop, and the resulting intrapulmonary shunting makes a small contribution to the hypoxemia that occurs with PE. $#(Choice C)#  Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) may be used to treat PE in patients who are hemodynamically unstable.  However, endothelial-derived TPA is limited primarily to the bronchial circulation, and spontaneous recanalization of the pulmonary artery is a slow process. $#(Choice D)#  PE leads to increased pulmonary arterial pressure; however, the pulmonary venous pressure is unchanged or decreased as blood flow through the proximal pulmonary circulation is obstructed.  Patients with an underlying elevation in pulmonary venous pressure (eg, decompensated heart failure) may be more likely to experience lung infarction with PE due to the high pulmonary venous pressure impairing collateral flow from the bronchial circulation. $#(Choice E)#  Intrapulmonary shunting occurs when an area of the lung is adequately perfused but poorly ventilated.  PE causes intrapulmonary shunting due to redistribution of blood away from segments directly affected by the clot; the remaining accessible alveoli are unable to fully oxygenate all the blood passing through the pulmonary circulation, resulting in hypoxemia.  In contrast, areas distal to the clot receive adequate ventilation but poor perfusion (ie, @dead space ventilation@). $#Educational objective# The lungs are supplied by dual circulation from both the pulmonary and bronchial arteries.  This collateral circulation can help protect against lung infarction due to pulmonary artery occlusion (ie, pulmonary embolism), as the bronchial circulation can continue to provide blood to the lung parenchyma.

Because of the close proximity of the subclavian vein to the apex of the lung, there is risk of lung puncture during the procedure. $Lung puncture allows air to pass into the pleural space.  If the puncture is small, the patient may remain asymptomatic.  With a large puncture, air rushes into the pleural space, leading to @pressure equalization@ and #loss of intrapleural negative pressure#, which causes shortness of breath due to inability to expand the affected lung.  Intrapleural and lung pressures usually remain nearly equivalent (ie, #simple pneumothorax#), and symptoms are limited to chest pain and respiratory difficulty. $Sometimes lung puncture results in formation of a #one-way tissue valve# that opens during inspiration to allow air into the pleural space and closes during expiration to trap that air, causing intrapleural pressure to @progressively increase@ with each breath (ie, #tension pathophysiology#).  The increasing pressure leads to contralateral mediastinal shifting (eg, tracheal deviation) and #vena cava collapse#, resulting in #decreased venous return# to the heart.  Cardiac output is reduced, leading to hypotension and tachycardia (ie, @obstructive shock@).  Treatment requires emergency decompression of the pleural space with needle insertion or chest-tube placement to prevent cardiac arrest. $#(Choices A and B)#  Decreased intravascular volume is the cause of @hypovolemic shock@ (eg, due to massive hemorrhage), and decreased systemic vascular resistance is the primary disturbance in @distributive shock@ (eg, due to sepsis).  The jugular veins are flat with these conditions, and unilaterally decreased breath sounds and tracheal deviation are not expected. $#(Choice D)#  An impaired baroreceptor reflex can cause or worsen hypotension due to failure of reflex-mediated vasoconstriction and increased heart rate.  This patient's tachycardia suggests that the baroreceptor reflex is intact. $#(Choice E)#  Increased intrapericardial pressure occurs in cardiac tamponade.  The increased pressure impairs diastolic filling of the right ventricle, leading to obstructive shock.  Although jugular venous distension is expected, cardiac tamponade does not explain this patient's unilaterally decreased breath sounds and tracheal deviation. $#Educational objective# Tension pneumothorax involves progressively increasing intrapleural pressure that leads to contralateral mediastinal shifting (eg, tracheal deviation) and vena cava collapse.  Hypotension, tachycardia, and obstructive shock develop due to decreased venous return to the heart.  ",

This line is the outer edge of the collapsed right lung; the dark space peripheral to the lung represents air in the chest cavity. $The following characteristic physical examination findings are expected with pneumothorax: $• Tactile fremitus represents airway vibrations generated by vocalized sound (eg, saying \"ninety-nine\") and is measured by the examiner placing hands on the patient's back.  Because air in the chest cavity insulates and dampens airway vibrations before they reach the patient's back, #decreased tactile fremitus# is expected #(choice C).# $• Breath sounds are caused by air movement within the airways, and the intensity varies by lung location.  Vesicular breath sounds are normal over the periphery; bronchial breath sounds are higher-intensity sounds that are normal over the hilum but indicate pathology (eg, lobar consolidation) over the periphery.  Because the lung is partially collapsed, leading to less air movement, and sounds from the airways are insulated by air in the chest cavity, #decreased breath sound intensity# is expected #(choices D and F)#. $• Resonance refers to the frequency of sound generated by percussion, and it varies with density.  Because air alone is less dense than a composite of lung parenchyma and air (ie, normal lung), higher-than-normal sound frequency to percussion (ie, #hyperresonance#) is expected. $#(Choice A)#  Like pneumothorax, fluid in the chest cavity (ie, pleural effusion) insulates airway vibrations and sounds, causing decreased tactile fremitus and breath sound intensity.  However, because fluid is more dense than normal lung, dullness to percussion is expected.  Atelectasis generates findings similar to those of pleural effusion; the collapsed lung reduces air movement and vibration within the airways, and the airless lung parenchyma is more dense than normal, air-filled lung. $#(Choice B)#  Consolidated, fluid-filled lung (eg, lobar pneumonia) is more dense than normal lung.  This leads to increased transmission of vibration and sound (ie, increased tactile fremitus and breath sound intensity) and dullness to percussion. $#(Choice G)#  Normal lung demonstrates resonance to percussion, baseline tactile fremitus, and vesicular (normal-intensity) breath sounds. $#Educational objective# Pneumothorax is recognized on chest x-ray by a continuous line without lung markings peripheral to it.

Compliance is defined as change in volume per change in pressure and is represented by the slope of the pressure-volume curve (eg, high compliance is illustrated by a steep-sloping curve).  Lung compliance demonstrates hysteresis (ie, compliance differs during inspiration and expiration) due to the effects of alveolar surface tension.  The flatness of the #inspiratory lung compliance# curve at very low lung volumes reflects the difficulty in inflating a collapsed lung and represents #decreased #compliance compared to that at the FRC. $#Educational objective# The lungs exert collapsing force, and the resting chest wall exerts expanding force.  These opposing forces are in equilibrium at the functional residual capacity and generate sustained intrapleural negative pressure that allows the lung and chest wall to move together as a combined respiratory unit.  Loss of intrapleural negative pressure (eg, pneumothorax) disrupts the combined system, causing the chest wall to spring outward to its equilibrium position, enlarging the hemithorax.  Similarly, the lung collapses to its equilibrium position where inspiratory compliance is decreased.   ",

  "explanation_2": "$#Acute respiratory distress syndrome# (ARDS) refers to inflammatory lung damage triggered by alveolar injury (eg, aspiration of water) or intense systemic inflammation (eg, sepsis, pancreatitis).  ARDS has a mortality rate of approximately 40%; those who survive often have #reduced lung function# that persists for months or years and is sometimes permanent. $The pathogenesis of ARDS can progress through 3 phases, although most patients move through only the first 2.  The #exudative phase# (phase 1) involves inflammatory disruption of the alveolar-capillary membrane with leakage of protein-rich fluid from the alveolar capillaries into the alveoli and surrounding interstitium.  Gas exchange is acutely impaired by alveolar edema and by hyaline membranes that develop on the alveolar surface.  After 1-2 weeks, ARDS progresses to the #proliferative phase# (phase 2), during which endothelial cells, pneumocytes, and fibroblasts proliferate in an attempt to repair damage.  Collagen is deposited in the interstitium and may lead to scarring. $The majority of ARDS survivors have a persistent #reduction in diffusion capacity# that eventually normalizes after several years #(choice B).#  These patients may remain in a prolonged proliferative phase in which interstitial collagen deposition and remodeling impair gas diffusion across the alveolar-capillary membrane, causing an #increased alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient# that manifests clinically with mild dyspnea.  A small percentage of surviving patients likely enter and remain in the fibrotic phase (phase 3) of ARDS, during which severe interstitial fibrosis develops and manifests as an irreversible reduction in diffusion capacity with marked clinical symptoms (eg, severe dyspnea). $#(Choices C and E)#  Collagen deposition during recovery from ARDS typically leads to decreased lung compliance, which in some patients manifests as a restrictive defect with reductions in both forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in 1 second on pulmonary function testing.  The reductions in expiratory lung volumes typically normalize within 6 months. $#(Choice D)#  The pulmonary edema in ARDS is noncardiogenic, meaning it does not result from heart failure and involves normal left atrial pressure (estimated by pulmonary capillary wedge pressure) during both the acute disease and recovery. $#Educational objective# Survivors of acute respiratory distress syndrome commonly have reduced lung function that persists for months or years and is sometimes permanent.  The majority of patients have reduced diffusion capacity that eventually normalizes after several years, whereas a small percentage develop extensive fibrosis with a marked and permanent reduction in diffusion capacity.

In healthy lungs, diffusion of oxygen occurs very rapidly: red blood cells become fully saturated with oxygen at only one-third of the total alveolar capillary length.  For this reason, oxygen saturation does not fall even with large increases in cardiac output during exercise.  In other words, normal oxygen transfer is #perfusion limited# (ie, diffusion is so fast that oxygen transfer depends on the perfusion rate [cardiac output] only). $#Diffusion limitation# is a mechanism of hypoxia that occurs in diseases that disrupt the alveolar-capillary membrane (eg, emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis).  This patient's progressive dyspnea and fine inspiratory crackles are consistent with #interstitial lung disease#.  Fibrotic thickening of the interstitial space (between the air and blood) increases the distance that oxygen must cross, limiting the degree of oxygen diffusion.  During @exercise@, the #increase in pulmonary blood flow #accelerates transit through the pulmonary capillaries, reducing the time for oxygen extraction.  In patients with diffusion limitation, the increased blood flow during exercise can result in #exertional hypoxemia#, even if oxygenation is normal at rest. $#(Choices A, B, and D)#  In healthy individuals, exercise results in increased minute ventilation (ie, product of increased respiratory rate × larger tidal volumes).  At the same time, recruitment of apical pulmonary capillaries (increased perfusion) promotes continued ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) matching as ventilation increases.  This remarkably stable V/Q matching during exercise enhances oxygen exchange, preventing hypoxemia. $#Educational objective# Diffusion of oxygen across the alveolar-capillary membrane is normally very rapid.  Decreased diffusion rate (eg, interstitial lung disease) can lead to diffusion-limited oxygen transfer, especially when the perfusion rate increases (eg, exertion).  ",

Progressive elastin degradation in COPD has significant effects on lung volumes: $• Beginning early in the disease course, loss of elastin tethering fibers leads to abnormal expiratory collapse of the distal airways.  Expiratory flow is reduced, leading to poor lung emptying.  This is measured as a markedly #increased residual volume# (RV), known as #air trapping#. $• With continued elastin loss, lung tissue becomes abnormally compliant (ie, distensible, \"loose and baggy\" alveoli); destruction of the interalveolar septal walls results in alveolar enlargement.  These conditions lead to an #increased total lung capacity# (TLC), known as lung #hyperinflation#. $Air trapping limits the lung's ability to expire air, decreasing expiratory reserve volume (ERV).  Lung hyperinflation flattens the diaphragm, impairing its ability to descend and draw air into the lungs during inspiration; this leads to reduced inspiratory reserve volume (IRV).  The reduced IRV and ERV (ie, decreased air movement during both inspiration and expiration) manifests as a #decrease in forced vital capacity# (the total volume of air that can be forcefully inspired after a maximal expiration). $#(Choice A)#  These findings are consistent with a restrictive process affecting the lung parenchyma (eg, interstitial lung disease) or chest wall (eg, severe kyphosis).  All volumes tend to be uniformly reduced due to poor distensibility of the lungs (eg, collagen deposition) and/or thoracic cage (eg, spine deformity). $#(Choice B)#  These findings are consistent with a restrictive process due to neuromuscular disease (eg, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, myasthenia gravis).  TLC is reduced due to inspiratory muscle (diaphragm) weakness, and RV is elevated due to expiratory muscle (eg, internal intercostals) weakness. $#(Choices C and E)#  Forced VC is the difference between TLC and RV.  Therefore, a low TLC and high RV would produce a low VC; conversely, a high TLC and low RV would produce a high VC. $#(Choice F)#  These findings can be seen in highly conditioned athletes due to increased airway diameter and robust respiratory muscle strength. $#Educational objective# Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is characterized by elevated residual volume (air trapping), elevated total lung capacity (hyperinflation), and reduced forced vital capacity.

In addition to promoting water retention (via renal collecting duct V2 receptors), vasopressin is one of the most potent vasoconstrictors (via arteriolar smooth muscle V1 receptors).  In septic shock, however, #vasopressin is suppressed#, possibly due to impaired baroreceptor reflexes and/or depletion of endogenous stores. $For this reason, infusion of vasopressin can be helpful during treatment of septic shock, often decreasing the need for other pharmacologic vasoconstrictor agents (eg, norepinephrine). $#(Choice A)#  C-reactive protein is an acute-phase protein produced in the liver in response to inflammation; it activates the classical @complement pathway@ and promotes phagocytosis, thereby facilitating clearance of bacteria and cellular debris.

This is consistent with #acute respiratory distress syndrome# (ARDS). $ARDS can be caused by events that injure the lung directly (eg, chemical inhalation, pneumonia) or #indirectly# (eg, pancreatitis, sepsis from #extrapulmonary infection#).  In both cases, the innate immune system is activated by 2 types of danger signals: $• Pathogen-associated molecular patterns #(PAMPs)#: exogenous motifs such as bacterial cell wall products (eg, lipopolysaccharide, peptidoglycans). $• Damage-associated molecular patterns #(DAMPs)#: endogenous (ie, self) motifs released during tissue injury (eg, mitochondrial DNA, histones, hyaluronic acid fragments).  DAMPs explain how sterile insults (eg, massive trauma) induce systemic inflammation (and ARDS). $In this patient with local cellulitis (ie, an infection #distant from the lung#), PAMPs (eg, from Streptococcus pyogenes) and DAMPs (eg, from damaged soft tissue) are released into the circulation.  They are highly immunogenic and engage pattern recognition receptors such as #toll-like receptors#.  Stimulation of these receptors results in increased #endothelial permeability# in the pulmonary circulation along with #neutrophil recruitment# into the alveolar tissue.  Subsequent release of cytokines (eg, IL-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha) causes inflammatory lung injury.  Widespread endothelial involvement can also lead to more generalized sepsis. $#(Choice A)#  Although local lipopolysaccharide production (eg, Pseudomonas pneumonia) can cause direct alveolar epithelial damage, lipopolysaccharide entering the circulation from a distant site (eg, perforated bowel) causes endothelial damage and indirect lung injury.  Furthermore, lipopolysaccharide is produced by gram-negative bacteria; this patient has a group A Streptococcus (gram-positive) infection. $#(Choice B)#  @Granulomatous inflammation@ involves proliferation of macrophages driven by T cells, such as with tuberculosis and sarcoidosis.  These conditions typically cause chronic lung disease developing over months (rather than acute respiratory distress) and present with nodules and lymphadenopathy (not diffuse alveolar infiltrates). $#(Choice C)#  Mast cell degranulation contributes primarily to bronchoconstriction (eg, asthma, anaphylaxis) due to release of preformed mediators (eg, histamine, prostaglandins).  Patients typically have wheezing (rather than crackles) and clear lungs (rather than diffuse alveolar infiltrates) on chest imaging. $#(Choice E)#  The @fibrotic phase of ARDS@ involves chronic (eg, weeks to months) replacement of damaged alveoli by fibroblasts and collagen driven by profibrotic cytokines (eg, TGF-beta).  It occurs after the acute inflammatory exudative response has subsided, which is ongoing in this patient. $#Educational objective# Pattern recognition receptors on innate immune cells (eg, neutrophils) respond to molecules produced by pathogens (eg, bacterial cell wall components) and damaged host tissue (eg, extracellular histones) to drive far-reaching inflammatory responses (eg, acute respiratory distress syndrome).

During its course, the SVC is surrounded by multiple mediastinal structures (eg, trachea, right bronchus, aorta, right pulmonary artery) and is close to the perihilar and paratracheal lymph nodes. $Due to its thin walls, the SVC can be easily #compressed by mediastinal masses# (most commonly #malignancy#) that either extend into the mediastinum from the central lung (eg, small cell lung cancer) or nearby lymph nodes (eg, non-Hodgkin lymphoma).

In contrast to COPD, patients with asthma sometimes develop a high DLCO (increased negative intrathoracic pressure during inspiration increases pulmonary capillary blood volume, causing additional gas uptake). $#(Choice C)#  Pulmonary arterial hypertension presents with reduced DLCO in the setting of normal spirometry and lung volumes, as the poor pulmonary capillary blood flow impairs the lungs' ability to extract oxygen (reduced DLCO); the airways and lung parenchyma are unaffected, resulting in intact lung mechanics (normal FEV1/FVC ratio and TLC). $#(Choices D and E)#  Restrictive processes demonstrate reduced lung volumes (eg, low TLC) with a normal or an increased FEV1/FVC ratio (although FEV1 and FVC are reduced individually).  The DLCO differentiates intrinsic restriction (eg, interstitial lung disease) from extrinsic restriction (eg, kyphosis, neuromuscular disease); it is decreased in the former (thickened basement membrane) and normal in the latter. $#Educational objective# Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency can induce early-onset emphysema, which is further accelerated by smoking.  Emphysema is characterized by expiratory airflow obstruction (decreased FEV1/FVC ratio), airspace enlargement and hyperinflation (increased total lung capacity), and a decreased diffusing capacity due to loss of alveolar surface area.

  "explanation_2": "This young adult has a history of recurrent epistaxis, @cutaneous telangiectasias@, and signs of pulmonary vascular disease.  These findings are consistent with #hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia# (HHT) (Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome).  HHT is caused by autosomal dominant mutations of genes involved in angiogenesis (eg, ENG, ACVRL1), leading to multiorgan #arteriovenous malformations# (AVMs).  In the lungs, HHT is associated with #pulmonary AVMs#, which may present with cyanosis, digital clubbing, hemoptysis, and #platypnea# (dyspnea aggravated by upright posture).  The mechanism of platypnea is a gravitational increase in perfusion through the arteriovenous (AV) communications in the lower lung, worsening V/Q mismatch. $HHT can induce #pulmonary hypertension# (progressive dyspnea, loud P2 [pulmonic component of S2]) in some patients.  This is usually due to extensive #systemic AVMs# (eg, hepatic) provoking #chronic, high-output heart failure# (widened pulse pressure, tachycardia) that elevates mean pulmonary arterial pressure.  HHT vascular gene mutations can also induce hypertrophic remodeling, leading to occlusion of the small precapillary pulmonary arteries, contributing to development of pulmonary hypertension. $#(Choice A)#  Obstructive airway disease (eg, cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis) may cause digital clubbing and a loud P2 (pulmonary hypertension due to lung disease).  However, lung examination would be abnormal (eg, wheezing, decreased air movement).  Furthermore, this patient's recurrent epistaxis, cutaneous angiomas, and platypnea are more suggestive of HHT. $#(Choices B and D)#  Infective endocarditis may cause digital clubbing and cutaneous lesions.  Dermal findings include @Osler nodes@, @Janeway lesions@, and @splinter hemorrhages@.  Involvement of the aortic valve can cause aortic regurgitation, resulting in widened pulse pressure and heart failure.  However, recurrent epistaxis, telangiectasias, and platypnea are more consistent with HHT. $#(Choice C)#  Pulmonary fibrosis can cause progressive dyspnea, digital clubbing, and a loud P2 (pulmonary hypertension due to lung disease).  However, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis affects individuals in late adulthood, and lung examination would reveal inspiratory crackles. $#Educational objective# Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia presents with mucocutaneous telangiectasias, epistaxis, and visceral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) (eg, liver, lung, brain).

However, asymptomatic patients may have normal lung function tests, with alterations in lung function occurring only during exacerbations.  This patient with intermittent shortness of breath has a normal FEV1/FVC ratio, therefore, further studies are required to exclude the diagnosis of asthma. $#Bronchial challenge testing# is a highly sensitive test with #high negative predictive value# used to assess #bronchial hyperreactivity# and exclude asthma.

However, patients may have allergic disease without asthma and patients with nonallergic (intrinsic) asthma may not have allergies; therefore this test is not useful for diagnosing asthma. $#(Choice D)#  During an asthma attack, the lungs may appear hyperinflated on chest x-ray.  However, chest x-rays are often normal between attacks; therefore, a chest x-ray cannot exclude asthma. $#(Choice E)#  Although serum IgE levels are generally elevated in patients with allergic asthma, patients with nonimmune-mediated asthma have normal levels of serum IgE.  Intrinsic asthma can be precipitated by pulmonary infections (especially viral), aspirin ingestion, cold air, inhaled irritants (eg, perfumes), stress, and exercise. $#Educational objective# Bronchial challenge testing is a highly sensitive but nonspecific measure that can help exclude a diagnosis of asthma.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient's clinical presentation is consistent with #pulmonary hypertension#.  The disease most commonly presents with progressive dyspnea, and patients may also experience exertional angina or syncope.  Physical examination reveals a #loud pulmonic component (P2) of S2#, caused by forceful pulmonic valve closure in the setting of high pulmonary arterial pressure.  In addition, the right ventricle becomes enlarged due to increased pressure load (ie, concentric right ventricular hypertrophy), which can create an accentuated impulse palpated at the left sternal border (#left parasternal lift# due to #right ventricular heave#). $@Pulmonary arterial hypertension@ describes pulmonary hypertension directly caused by vascular remodeling of the small pulmonary arteries/arterioles; relatively young women are most commonly affected.  Fatigue and exertional dyspnea are common and result from decreased cardiac output due to the inability of the right ventricle to pump blood through the lungs.  Right-sided heart failure eventually develops, but because left ventricular function remains intact, there is an #absence of pulmonary edema# in pulmonary arterial hypertension. $#(Choice A)#  Hypertensive heart disease occurs as the result of prolonged systemic hypertension.  It involves @concentric left ventricular hypertrophy@, leading to impaired ventricular compliance and diastolic heart failure.  Pulmonary edema is expected with diastolic heart failure that is severe enough to cause dyspnea. $#(Choice B)#  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy typically demonstrates a crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur best heard at the left sternal border.  The murmur intensifies with maneuvers that decrease left ventricular blood volume (eg, abrupt standing, Valsalva strain phase). $#(Choice C)#  Left bundle branch block can delay closure of the aortic valve, leading to later occurrence of the aortic component (A2) of S2 and narrowed or paradoxical @splitting@.  However, left bundle branch block is unlikely to significantly affect the relative audible intensity of A2 and P2. $#(Choice E)#  Pulmonic valve stenosis can delay the occurrence of P2 (later valve closure) but typically leads to a softer intensity of P2. $#Educational objective# Pulmonary hypertension can be recognized on physical examination by a loud pulmonic component of S2 and an accentuated, palpable impulse at the left sternal border (left parasternal lift due to right ventricular heave).

  "explanation_2": "$Chronic cough and recurrent sinusitis in a young patient should raise suspicion for #cystic fibrosis# (CF).  The diagnosis of CF typically is based on elevated sweat chloride concentrations, characteristic clinical findings (#recurrent sinopulmonary infections#, pancreatic insufficiency), and/or a positive family history.  However, patients with mild mutations of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene may have normal sweat testing.  In these cases, a useful diagnostic adjunct involves measuring the nasal transepithelial potential difference. $In intestinal and #respiratory epithelia#, the CFTR channel secretes chloride ions into the lumen and also has a tonic inhibitory effect on the opening of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), which decreases sodium reabsorption into the cell.  This high luminal salt content helps retain water in the lumen, forming well-hydrated mucus.  During the #nasal transepithelial potential difference# test, a saline solution is applied to the nose.  Because patients with CF have #increased sodium absorption# via the ENaC, sodium is absorbed intracellularly but chloride in the saline solution is retained in the lumen.  The higher relative amounts of negatively charged chloride on the epithelial surface result in a #more negative# transepithelial voltage difference. $CFTR channel functioning is reversed in @sweat ducts@ compared with that in respiratory and intestinal glands.  CFTR reduces the salt content of sweat by reabsorbing luminal chloride and stimulating ENaC to increase sodium absorption from the lumen into the cells.  CFTR mutations therefore result in the production of sweat with high chloride and sodium content. $#(Choice A)#  CFTR mutations lower the rate of bicarbonate secretion in the pancreatic ducts, promoting mucin precipitation and the formation of intraductal concretions that cause exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.  However, this effect is not related to the nasal transepithelial potential difference test. $#(Choice B)#  CFTR mutations impair the passive transport of chloride along its concentration gradient, decreasing chloride secretion by respiratory epithelial cells. $#(Choice C)#  The water content of mucus is decreased (not increased) in patients with CF, resulting in dehydrated mucus that predisposes to the formation of mucus plugs and chronic sinopulmonary infections. $#(Choice E)#  CFTR mutations do not significantly alter transmembrane potassium transport. $#Educational objective# In cystic fibrosis, impairment of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein reduces chloride secretion and increases sodium absorption by the respiratory epithelia, resulting in dehydrated mucus.  When saline is applied to the nasal mucosa, the increased sodium absorption in patients with CF causes a more negative nasal transepithelial potential difference, which can be used to diagnose cystic fibrosis.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient with fever, pulmonary symptoms, and a lobar consolidation on chest x-ray has #pneumonia#.  The presence of gram-positive diplococci in the sputum indicates the underlying pathogen is #Streptococcus pneumoniae#, the leading cause of community-acquired pneumonia.  Over 90 strains of S pneumoniae have been identified; they are distinguished based on antigenic variations in the #capsular polysaccharide#, the major virulence factor of the bacteria.  Antibodies against the polysaccharide capsule are generated during infection and provide long-lasting immunity against that strain. $The pneumococcal vaccine contains polysaccharide antigens from the most common disease-causing serotypes leading to the generation of protective antibodies against these strains.  In the United States, 2 types of pneumococcal vaccinations are available:  $1. #Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine# contains capsular material from 23 serotypes.  Because polysaccharides cannot be displayed by the major histocompatibility complex of antigen-presenting cells (only peptides can), immunogenicity to this vaccine is T-cell independent and generates a mild antibody response with no memory cells.  Although polysaccharide vaccines are fairly effective for most adult patients, they are not useful for infants (age <2).  $2. #Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine# consists of capsular polysaccharides from 13 serotypes that have been covalently attached to recombinant, inactivated diphtheria toxin.  Protein conjugation allows the polysaccharide to be displayed by the major histocompatibility complex and induces a much stronger immunogenic response that involves T-cell–mediated B-lymphocyte activation.  This generates high- affinity IgG antibodies and memory B-cells and also creates mucosal IgA antibodies, which reduce colonization rates. $Pneumococcal vaccination significantly reduces the risk of invasive pneumococcal disease.  Routine vaccination is recommended for all children as part of their childhood immunization series.  Adults age >65 and those at high risk for invasive disease (eg, HIV, asplenia, other immunosuppressed states) should also be vaccinated. $#(Choice A)#  Histoplasma is a fungal infection that is primarily transmitted by inhalation of particles from soil contaminated with bird or bat droppings.  Diagnosis is usually made by urine or serum antigen testing, but yeasts can sometimes be identified on histology/culture using specialized stains. $#(Choice B)#  Close contacts of patients who have pertussis should be given antibiotic chemoprophylaxis.  Pertussis is a gram-negative encapsulated coccobacillus; infected adults usually develop a few weeks of malaise and rhinorrhea followed by several weeks of severe, paroxysmal cough. $#(Choice C)#  The influenza vaccine contains 3 or 4 strains of inactivated influenza virus.  Influenza usually causes abrupt-onset fever, headache, myalgia, and malaise and would not appear on Gram stain. $#(Choice D)#  Legionella is a common cause of atypical pneumonia and is usually transmitted by contaminated water systems.  However, Legionella is a gram-negative bacterium (not a gram-positive diplococcus) and is usually diagnosed with urine antigen testing. $#Educational objective# Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccination reduces the risk of invasive disease and is recommended for young patients and the elderly.  The pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine is an unconjugated vaccine that induces a T-cell–independent humoral immune response.  In contrast, the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine contains polysaccharide material attached to a protein antigen, which creates a robust T-cell–mediated humoral immune response.  "

  "explanation_2": "#Blastomyces dermatitidis#, a fungus endemic in the southeastern United States (states east of the Mississippi River), is present in soil and rotten organic matter.  Blastomyces is a dimorphic fungus, meaning it assumes different forms at different temperatures.  In the human body (37-40 C), it assumes the @yeast form@ (single cells).  The image shows a typical #large yeast# with a single, #broad-based bud#.  The mold form (branching hyphae) predominates in the environment, at average temperatures of 25-30 C. $Infection occurs by inhalation of aerosolized fungus from the environment.  In about half of #immunocompetent# individuals, blastomycosis may present as a lung infection or cause a flu-like illness (fever, chills, myalgia, headache, nonproductive cough) or pneumonia (fever, cough, pleuritic chest pain).  #Pulmonary# blastomycosis is diagnosed by finding the typical yeast forms.  In #immunocompromised# patients, blastomycosis can cause #disseminated# disease.  Patients experience systemic symptoms (fever, weight loss, night sweats), lung involvement (cough, dyspnea), skin lesions (papules, pustules, ulcers, verrucous lesions), and #bone# pain (caused by lytic lesions). $#(Choice A)# @ Aspergillus fumigatus@ can cause lung disease in immunocompromised patients.  It has only a mold form; in tissue samples it is seen as septate hyphae that branch at 45-degree angles. $#(Choice C)#  @Candida albicans@ is characterized by small oval yeast with narrow-based budding.  Candida pneumonia is a very rare disease. $#(Choice D)#  @Coccidioides immitis@ is also a dimorphic fungus.  It is seen as spherules (round encapsulated structures containing many endospores) in tissue samples. $#(Choice E)#  @Cryptococcus neoformans@ causes lung disease and meningitis in immunocompromised patients.  In contrast to blastomycosis, it forms round yeast with variable sizes and narrow-based buds.  Cryptococcus has a thick polysaccharide capsule that appears clear with India ink staining and stains red with mucicarmine. $#(Choice F)#  @Histoplasma capsulatum@ can cause lung disease.  Like Blastomyces, it is a dimorphic fungus.  Unlike Blastomyces, the yeast form of Histoplasma is smaller and is often found intracellularly within macrophages.  H capsulatum is endemic in parts of the central and eastern United States along the Ohio and Mississippi river valleys. $#(Choice G)#  Rhizopus species can cause lung disease in immunocompromised patients.  Rhizopus is the most common genus causing @mucormycosis@.  It has only a mold form, with broad ribbon-like hyphae with rare septations. $ #Educational objective# Blastomyces dermatitidis is a dimorphic fungus seen in tissue as round or oval yeasts with thick walls and broad-based budding.  It is endemic in the southeastern United States (states east of the Mississippi River).  The lungs are the primary site of involvement, and the skin and bone are the major sites of dissemination.  ",

  "explanation_2": "#Legionellosis# can be divided into Pontiac fever (an acute, flu-like, self-limited disease) and the more common Legionnaires' disease.  Legionnaires' disease should be suspected in patients with recent exposure to #contaminated water# (sporadic cases or common-source outbreaks in cruise ships, spas, hospitals, or air-conditioned hotels), radiographic evidence of pneumonia (typically patchy infiltrates that may progress to consolidation), #high fever# (>39 C [102.2 F]) sometimes associated with #relative bradycardia#,# neurologic# symptoms (eg, confusion, headache), and #gastrointestinal #(GI) symptoms (eg, diarrhea).  Risk groups include the elderly or immunocompromised, smokers, and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. $Because Legionella pneumophila is a faintly staining gram-negative bacillus that is facultatively intracellular, Gram stain typically shows many neutrophils but few or no organisms.  Legionella is often diagnosed by urinary antigen testing; it grows on selective medium (buffered charcoal yeast extract [BCYE]).  The most common laboratory abnormality is #hyponatremia#, frequently associated with Legionella but not other causes of pneumonia.  The hyponatremia may be related to inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion and/or renal tubulointerstitial disease impairing sodium reabsorption (possibly due to either direct effect of Legionella, cytokines, or natriuretic peptides).  Elevated transaminases are also common. $#(Choice A)#  This patient does not have asthma, making allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (pulmonary infiltrates/bronchiectasis with eosinophilia and elevated IgE and anti-Aspergillus antibody titers) unlikely.  Some helminthic infections are associated with pulmonary infiltrates and eosinophilia (Löffler).  However, high fever, neurologic symptoms, and concurrent GI and pulmonary symptoms are unusual. $#(Choices B and D)#  Streptococcus pneumoniae (gram-positive diplococci on Gram stain) is the most common overall cause of community-acquired pneumonia.  Lobar consolidation is classic.  Patients with influenza A typically experience the abrupt onset of fever, headache, myalgias, and malaise that gradually improve over 2-5 days, with a subset developing secondary bacterial pneumonia (exacerbation of fever and respiratory symptoms after initial improvement).  However, dry cough, GI and neurologic symptoms, and interstitial infiltrates in the setting of a recent cruise make Legionella more likely. $#(Choice E)#  Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection can result in cold agglutinin formation.  However, M pneumoniae predominantly affects young adults and is more likely to cause tracheobronchitis than pneumonia.  Clinical presentation is typically mild with bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray appearing more severe than expected based on clinical findings. $#Educational objective# Legionella pneumophila is a facultative intracellular gram-negative bacillus that can cause a systemic infection.  Symptoms frequently include high fever, cough, confusion, and diarrhea.  The most common laboratory abnormality seen with Legionella pneumonia is hyponatremia, and sputum Gram stain often shows many neutrophils but few or no organisms.  "

This patient may have contracted the disease during karate sessions with his students.  Chest x-ray is unremarkable in most cases as there is no pulmonary consolidation.

Paroxysmal phase - marked by #severe coughing spells# with the classic inspiratory whoop or #post-tussive emesis/syncope  $##3. #Convalescent phase - during which the cough improves $Pertussis is caused by the #gram-negative coccobacillus# Bordetella pertussis, which produces virulence factors that include adhesins and toxins.  Pertactin, which forms the basis of the acellular pertussis vaccine, promotes B pertussis adherence to the ciliated upper respiratory epithelium.  Tracheal cytotoxin subsequently promotes local tissue destruction, resulting in cough.  #Pertussis toxin# causes excessive #adenylate cyclase activity#, which prevents effective phagocytosis and allows the organism to persist in alveolar macrophages and ciliated epithelial cells, leading to a prolonged disease course.  #Lymphocytosis#, induced by pertussis toxin, is also common. $#(Choice A)#  This patient lacks the constitutional symptoms (eg, night sweats, weight loss, fever) and chest x-ray findings (eg, upper lobe infiltrates with cavitation) expected in pulmonary tuberculosis, which is caused by the acid-fast bacillus Mycobacterium tuberculosis. $#(Choice C)#  Streptococcus pneumoniae, a gram-positive diplococcus, is the most common cause of pneumonia and typically presents with lobar consolidation on chest x-ray.

Detection of the pathogen is typically made with #urine antigen testing#, but the organism can also be visualized with silver stain and grown on buffered charcoal yeast extract agar supplemented with L-cysteine and iron (ground-glass colonies).  L pneumophila has a strong affinity for the lung (hence the name pneumophila) and typically causes a #multifocal pneumonia# that is preceded by nonspecific symptoms (eg, high fever, myalgia, headache) and diarrhea. $L pneumophila is a frequent contaminant of natural bodies of water, municipal #water supplies#, and water-based# cooling systems# found in commercial and hospital settings.  #Aerosolization# and subsequent inhalation of contaminated water can lead to #outbreaks# of Legionella pneumonia.  Common nosocomial sources of infection include showers/baths, cooling towers, nasogastric tubes, ventilators, nebulizers, and other respiratory therapy equipment.  Cigarette smoking and chronic lung disease increase the risk for infection. $#(Choice A)#  Staphylococcus aureus colonizes the anterior nares and can spread from asymptomatic carriers to hospitalized patients or other individuals.  Although methicillin-resistant S aureus can cause severe, rapidly progressive pneumonia, the organism appears as gram-positive cocci in clusters. $#(Choice C)#  Listeria can be transmitted by contaminated ready-to-eat food.  It is associated with febrile diarrhea and is poorly visualized by Gram stain.  However, the diagnosis is usually made by visualizing the organism on light microscopy (tumbling motility) or identifying it on blood or cerebrospinal fluid culture.  It is not typically identified by sputum sample silver stain or urine antigen testing. $#(Choice D)#  Influenza colonizes the nasopharynx, and outbreaks are common in long-term care facilities and other cohabitated settings.  Although influenza often causes nonspecific symptoms (eg, myalgia, malaise, fever) and cough, the virus is typically diagnosed by antigen testing from a nasopharyngeal swab. $#(Choice E)#  Widespread use of long-term intravascular devices increases the risk of catheter-related bacteremia and sepsis with skin flora such as coagulase-negative staphylococci and S aureus.  Bacteremia is typically identified by Gram stain and culture of peripheral blood. $#Educational objective# Legionella pneumophila commonly contaminates natural bodies of water, municipal water supplies, and water-based cooling systems.  The organism is inhaled in aerosolized water and establishes infection via the pulmonary route.

  "explanation_2": "$This asymptomatic patient with previously eradicated tuberculosis now has a spherical mass occupying a preexisting lung cavity, findings consistent with an aspergilloma.  #Aspergillus fumigatus# is a mold that is ubiquitous in the environment and widely present in soil and organic matter.  Spores are constantly inhaled and typically cleared by the respiratory tract's innate defenses (eg, mucociliary escalator, macrophages).  However, #chronic colonization# can occur in patients with underlying abnormal lung structure, such as those with bullae (eg, emphysema) or #old cavities# (eg, prior tuberculosis, postsurgical status). $Over months to years, Aspergillus proliferates in the cavity, forming a conglomeration of hyphae and cellular debris known as an #aspergilloma#.  The @fungus ball@ (mycetoma) appears as a round intracavity mass surrounded by a crescent of air (surrounding empty space).  The aspergilloma @shifts with gravity@, helping distinguish it from other lung masses (eg, neoplasm) fixed to the parenchyma. $Aspergillomas typically grow uneventfully and do not elicit a significant host immunologic reaction.  Therefore, they usually remain asymptomatic for years and are only #detected incidentally# (as in this trauma patient).  Occasionally, aspergillomas can erode into adjacent blood vessels, producing #hemoptysis#. $#(Choice A)#  Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is a TH2–induced, IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to Aspergillus spores that become trapped in dysfunctional airways (eg, asthma, cystic fibrosis).  It presents with difficult-to-control asthma and @bronchiectasis@ (copious, thick sputum; thickened dilated airways with mucus impaction). $#(Choice C)#  Aspergillus is not contagious (ie, transmissible from person to person); it is acquired passively from inhalation of fungal spores in the environment.  Reactivation tuberculosis can cause new areas of cavitation or consolidation (not a cavity-filling mass) and is typically accompanied by profound constitutional symptoms (eg, weight loss, night sweats, fever). $#(Choice D)#  @Dystrophic calcification@ is a frequent sequela of granulomatous inflammation (eg, old/healed histoplasmosis or tuberculosis).  However, such granuloma-related calcification would have radiodensity equal to that of bone (eg, similar to adjacent vertebrae), would not affect a preexisting cavity, and typically also involves the hilar lymph nodes. $#(Choice E)#  Squamous cell lung cancer can cavitate (representing central tumor necrosis).  However, invasive malignancies violate anatomic planes, appearing irregular and spiculated, and are typically symptomatic (eg, chest pain, hemoptysis, weight loss).  A well-circumscribed, round mass forming within a preexisting, thin-walled cavity is more consistent with aspergilloma. $#Educational objective# Aspergillus fumigatus, a ubiquitous environmental mold, can chronically colonize old pulmonary cavities (eg, prior tuberculosis), forming a fungus ball (aspergilloma) that does not elicit a significant host immune response and is typically discovered incidentally.

C. immitis is endemic to the southwestern United States (i.e., southern and central California, Arizona, New Mexico, and western Texas), northern Mexico, and some regions of Central and South America.  Patients with coccidioidomycosis are likely to live in or have recently traveled to an endemic area. $C. immitis is transmitted by spore inhalation.  Spores are formed by fragmentation of hyphae.  Once inside the lungs, the spores turn into spherules that contain endospores.  The spherules subsequently rupture and release endospores that disseminate to other organs and tissues.  Each endospore is capable of forming a new spherule. $In immunocompetent hosts, C. immitis causes lung disease, which can be asymptomatic or cause flu-like symptoms (e.g., cough, fever, and myalgia) accompanied by erythema nodosum.

  "explanation_2": "The procedure described above is the acid-fast stain, which is used in the detection of a select few pathogenic organisms (eg, Mycobacterium and some Nocardia species).  Although it is less sensitive than culture, the acid-fast stained smear allows for immediate microscopic evaluation. $In the acid-fast stain for mycobacteria, the smear is first treated with an aniline dye (eg, carbolfuchsin).  The dye (red color) penetrates the bacterial cell wall, where it binds with mycolic acids.  The slide is then treated with hydrochloric acid and alcohol.  This acid alcohol dissolves the outer cell membranes of nontuberculous bacteria, but the presence of mycolic acids prevents decolorization of mycobacteria.  A counterstain (eg, methylene blue) is then applied and taken up by decolorized bacteria.  As a result, the carbolfuchsin acid-fast stain produces red mycobacteria (initial stain) and blue non-acid fast bacteria. $The cell membrane and cell wall of mycobacteria are most similar to those in Gram-positive organisms, causing mycobacteria to appear weakly positive on Gram stain.  However, the mycobacterial cell wall differs from that of the typical Gram-positive organism in that they are encapsulated with mycolic acid, a waxy, long-chain fatty acid that is covalently bound to the sugars within the cell wall.  Another organism that will also stain positive with the acid-fast technique is Nocardia.  Nocardia is a Gram-positive rod that contains mycolic acid in its cell wall.  Because Nocardia possesses less mycolic acid than do mycobacteria, Nocardia is more weakly acid fast. $#(Choice A)#  N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetylglucosamine are the saccharides that combine with an amino acid chain to form the peptidoglycan layer in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative cell walls. $#(Choice B)#  Teichoic acid is a molecule linked to the peptidoglycan cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria (but not Gram-negative bacteria).  Teichoic acid serves as an antigenic determinant for organism identification in the laboratory and an antigenic target for the human immune system. $#(Choice C)#  Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a component of the outer cell envelope of Gram-negative bacteria. $#(Choice E)#  Unique to fungi, ergosterol is the sterol component of fungal cell membranes.  This molecule is not found in human cell membranes, as human cells have cholesterol in their cell membranes instead. $#Educational objective# The acid-fast stain identifies organisms that have mycolic acid present in their cell walls, including Mycobacterium and some Nocardia species.  Acid-fast staining is carried out by applying an aniline dye (eg, carbolfuchsin) to a smear and then decolorizing with acid alcohol to reveal whether the organisms present are \"acid fast.\"  "

Rhinovirus (a cause of the common cold) is a nonenveloped single-stranded RNA virus.  Adenovirus is a nonenveloped double-stranded DNA virus.  Although these viruses can cause respiratory illness, this patient's clinical features (2 weeks of progressive symptoms, impaired pulmonary function, no upper respiratory infection symptoms) and histologic findings make post-transplant CMV pneumonitis a more likely diagnosis, particularly given the lack of CMV prophylaxis. $#(Choice C)#  Organs affected by Nocardia and Actinomyces show filamentous branching beaded gram-positive rods in Gram stain preparations.  Nocardia is aerobic and positive for modified acid-fast stain; Actinomyces is anaerobic and negative for modified acid-fast stain. $#(Choice F)#  Histopathologic and cytologic findings in Pneumocystis jirovecii@ pneumonia (PCP)@ include eosinophilic foamy alveolar material and cystic and trophic forms that can be stained with Giemsa or @silver stain@ (producing a cup-in-saucer appearance).

The cells are arranged in long, slender, @serpentine cords@ due to the presence of a hydrophobic surface glycolipid called #cord factor#. $Cord factor is composed of two mycolic acid molecules bound to the disaccharide trehalose (trehalose dimycolate).  In vivo, cord factor forms cylindrical micelles that surround the organism and #prevent macrophage-mediated destruction# within the phagolysosome.  It also forms a highly toxic crystalline monolayer on hydrophobic surfaces (oil-water/air-water interface [eg, edge of cavitation]) that helps drive the formation of #caseating granulomas# (a hallmark of M tuberculosis infection). $#(Choice A)#  Mycolic acid is the primary component of the cell wall of all Mycobacterium species and is the source of their acid-fastness (ability to retain dye in the presence of acid).  Although mycolic acid is a component of cord factor, it alone does not cause M tuberculosis to grow in a serpentine pattern.  Other less virulent mycobacteria (eg, M avium) are also acid-fast but have lower concentrations of cord factor and do not typically form serpentine chains. $#(Choice B)#  M tuberculosis antibiotic resistance is due largely to mutations in the genes responsible for the synthesis of mycolic acid (isoniazid) and mycobacterial RNA polymerase (rifampin).  Antibiotic resistance does not cause the bacteria to grow in a serpentine pattern. $#(Choice C)#  Pigment production is characteristic of some mycobacteria, especially nontuberculous organisms such as M marinum, but is not associated with cord formation. $#(Choice D)#  The slow growth rate of M tuberculosis contributes to the need for prolonged antibiotic regimens due to decreased antibiotic responsiveness.  However, it does not affect the ability of the organism to form serpentine cords. $#Educational objective# Mycobacterium tuberculosis grows in long, serpentine cords due to the presence of cord factor, a surface glycolipid, on the cell wall.  Cord factor is a primary virulence factor of M tuberculosis; it protects the bacteria from digestion by macrophages and also leads to the formation of caseating granulomas.  ",

  "explanation_2": "$#Cystic fibrosis# (CF) is associated with the accumulation of @thick, viscous secretions@ in multiple organ systems.  In the lungs, secretions clog the airways, leading to the colonization of the lower respiratory tract with pathogenic bacteria early in the course of disease.  Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae are most commonly isolated in children, but #Pseudomonas aeruginosa#, a ubiquitous gram-negative bacillus, is the leading cause of respiratory tract colonization and infection in adults with CF. $P aeruginosa has several adaptations that make it well suited to the pulmonic environment of patients with CF including the ability to directly bind mucous, which shields the organism from phagocytosis.  Persistent colonization/infection is then primarily mediated by the following: $• #Biofilm formation# – The bacteria clump together within an extracellular matrix of polysaccharides, proteins, and DNA, which prevents phagocytosis and antibiotic-mediated destruction $• Conversion to a #mucoid phenotype# that produces an #alginate polysaccharide#, which strengthens biofilm structure and aids in the inhibition of opsonization and phagocytosis $• Downregulation of virulence factors (eg, flagella, pili, lipopolysaccharide components) reduces antigenic targets, which promotes persistent colonization $Neutrophils respond to the chronic infection by releasing elastase, myeloperoxidase, and other digestive enzymes.  However, these compounds fail to eliminate P aeruginosa and ultimately cause progressive destruction of the airway wall (ie, bronchiectasis) and a steady decline in pulmonary function. $#(Choices A and D)#  Pathogenic strains of H influenzae are able to form biofilms but do not convert to mucoid phenotype.

It exists as a filamentous mold in the environment and is found primarily in soil contaminated with #bird or bat droppings#.  Therefore, infected patients often report a history of exploring caves (exposure to bats) or cleaning bird cages or coops. $H capsulatum is transmitted when fungal spores from contaminated soil are inhaled into the alveoli.  At body temperature, the spores germinate into yeasts and are subsequently phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages.

  "explanation_2": "Although #HIV# is classically associated with impairment to the cell-mediated immune response, the virus also dramatically hampers the production of opsonizing antibodies and the recruitment of phagocytes to areas of infection.  Therefore, patients with HIV are at much greater risk for #invasive bacterial infections#, particularly with encapsulated organisms such as #Streptococcus pneumoniae#. $S pneumoniae is the most common cause of #community-acquired pneumonia# in both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected individuals, and usually presents with acute-onset fever, productive cough, leukocytosis, and signs of #lobar consolidation# (eg, dullness to percussion, crackles).  S pneumoniae is also a frequent cause of sepsis and bacterial meningitis.  To reduce the risk of invasive pneumococcal disease, all patients with HIV should be immunized with the pneumococcal vaccination, which provides immunity to the most common strains. $#(Choice A)#  Although invasive Aspergillus is much more common in patients with HIV, it primarily affects those with extremely low CD4 counts (<50/mm3).  Fever, cough, shortness of breath, and nodular or cavitary pulmonary infiltrate often occurs. $#(Choice B)#  Influenza usually causes acute-onset fever, malaise, myalgias, and headache.  Manifestations of lobar consolidation would be atypical and would likely indicate an influenza complication (eg, secondary pneumonia).  Patients with HIV should receive yearly influenza vaccination. $#(Choice C)#  Legionella is a common cause of atypical pneumonia and is far more common in patients with HIV than the general population.  Although Legionella often causes lobar consolidation, most cases are marked by several days of gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, vomiting, diarrhea) prior to developing pulmonary symptoms. $#(Choice D)#  Patients with HIV are at much greater risk of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, which usually presents over several weeks (not days) with cough, low-grade fever, weight loss, and fatigue.  Active pulmonary tuberculosis is usually characterized by cavitary disease in the upper lobes of the lung; signs of lower lobe consolidation would be atypical. $#(Choice E)#  Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a leading cause of \"walking pneumonia,\" a form of atypical pneumonia.  \"Walking pneumonia\" usually presents with several weeks (not days) of nonproductive cough and malaise.  The infection usually affects multiple lobes of lung and causes a bilateral patchy infiltrate on chest x-ray. $#(Choice F)#  Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is common in patients with HIV, but occurs primarily in those with CD4 counts <200/mm3 (unlike this patient).  It usually presents with several weeks (not days) of slowly worsening dyspnea and fever.  In addition, PCP usually affects both lungs and appears as @bilateral reticulonodular@ pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray. $#Educational objective# The most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia in both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected individuals is Streptococcus pneumoniae.  Risk of invasive pneumococcal disease is significantly increased in patients with HIV regardless of CD4 count.  ",

C neoformans is present in soil and pigeon droppings; it is transmitted by the respiratory route but not acquired via person-to-person contact.  Inhaled yeast forms enter the lungs, and in immunocompetent persons, they are cleared by a macrophage response directed by T cells.  In individuals with an impaired cellular immune response, C neoformans can disseminate and cause #symptomatic# disease, most commonly #meningoencephalitis#. $Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis is typically seen in patients with HIV, sarcoidosis, or leukemia and in those on high-dose corticosteroid therapy.  Headache, nausea, vomiting, and confusion are common symptoms.  Diagnosis can be made by examining @cerebrospinal fluid@ (CSF), which shows round, budding, encapsulated yeasts.  With @India ink staining@, the thick polysaccharide capsules classically appear as peripheral clearings or halos.  Serologic testing (latex agglutination) is used to detect the C neoformans capsular antigen in CSF. $#(Choices A and D)#  Esophagitis in a patient with HIV is most commonly caused by Candida infection; it presents with odynophagia and is diagnosed by endoscopy with biopsy.  Oral thrush due to Candida, which manifests as white oral plaques, is associated with diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression (eg, HIV), and treatment with antibiotics and corticosteroids. $#(Choice B)#  Although C neoformans enters the body through the lungs, pulmonary symptoms are often not prominent.  Some patients may develop cough, dyspnea, or pleuritic chest pain, but pulmonary cryptococcosis is a less common manifestation than cryptococcal meningoencephalitis.  In contrast, Pneumocystis jirovecii is a frequent cause of pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals, but microscopy would show cup- or crescent-shaped organisms (not budding yeast with thick, mucicarmine-positive capsules). $#(Choice E)#  Mucormycosis, which classically affects the paranasal sinuses, occurs in immunocompromised patients and is strongly associated with diabetes mellitus and diabetic ketoacidosis.  Aspergillus fumigatus is another fungus that may cause sinusitis. $#(Choice F)#  Cutaneous cryptococcal disease (eg, papules, pustules) is rare.  Dimorphic fungi Blastomyces and Histoplasma may cause cutaneous lesions, but the yeast forms do not have mucicarmine-positive capsules. $#Educational objective# Meningoencephalitis is the most common symptomatic presentation of Cryptococcus neoformans infection and typically occurs in immunocompromised patients.

  "explanation_2": "#Mycoplasma pneumoniae# infection is common in adolescents and usually presents with tracheobronchitis or walking pneumonia.  The pathogen attaches to the respiratory epithelium using surface antigens (#I-antigen#) that are also present on the plasma membrane of erythrocytes.  Therefore, patients with M pneumoniae typically develop @cross-reactive IgM antibodies@ that can attach to red blood cells, activate the complement system, and cause erythrocyte lysis.  These cross-reacting antibodies are called #cold agglutinins# because they bind to erythrocytes most strongly at temperatures #below core body temperature#.  Testing for cold agglutinins can be done at the bedside by drawing blood into an edetate disodium–containing tube and placing it in a cup of ice.  Removing the tube after several seconds will reveal clumping/agglutination that resolves as the tube warms. $Cold agglutinins are often asymptomatic, but some patients develop mild intravascular #hemolytic anemia# that usually resolves after 6-8 weeks (when IgM antibody titers fall).  Patients who have infectious mononucleosis and certain hematologic malignancies also commonly develop cold agglutinins. $#Educational objective# Infection with Mycoplasma pneumoniae can result in the formation of cold agglutinins, which are IgM antibodies (primarily) that bind red blood cells and cause clumping/agglutinations at low body temperatures.  Other illnesses resulting in cold agglutinin formation include infectious mononucleosis and certain hematologic malignancies.  ",

However, over 90 different antigenic variations (serotypes) of capsular polysaccharides have been identified, so future infection can occur with a strain that has not yet been encountered.  Therefore, patients at high risk for invasive pneumococcal disease (eg, HIV, extremes of age) are generally given the pneumococcal #vaccine#, which induces #immunity# against the #most common strains#. $Other virulence factors of S pneumoniae include IgA protease (inactivates secretory IgA), adhesins (necessary for adhesion to epithelial cells), and pneumolysin (cytotoxin that causes pores in cell membranes and cell lysis). $#(Choice A)#  Certain bacterial exotoxins (eg, Shiga toxin) enter the host cell and cleave a nucleobase from the host ribosome, thereby inhibiting host protein synthesis.

OHS results from physical restriction of lung expansion by excessive thoracic tissue mass.  As such, the hypoventilation mostly results from #reduced tidal volume# and patients may have normal or increased respiratory rate.  Most patients with OHS also have concomitant obstructive sleep apnea (OSA); unlike isolated OSA that involves hypoventilation only with sleep, OHS involves hypoventilation throughout the waking hours. $In healthy individuals, a normal alveolar to arterial (A-a) gradient ranges from 4-15 mm Hg, with older individuals having a gradient towards the higher end of normal.  A #normal A-a gradient# indicates that the efficiency of gas exchange between the alveoli and the blood is intact; therefore, hypoxemia must result from low partial pressure of alveolar oxygen (PAO2).  Low PAO2 can occur due to #alveolar hypoventilation# (eg, OHS, neuromuscular disease, central depression of respiratory drive) or inspiration of low partial pressure of oxygen at high altitude. $#(Choices B and C)#  Destruction of lung parenchyma occurs with both emphysema and interstitial lung disease.  This leads to disruption of the alveolar-capillary membrane and impaired diffusion capacity with an increased A-a gradient.  In OHS, the lung parenchyma is undamaged and diffusion capacity is intact. $#(Choice D)#  Although the lung parenchyma is unaffected in OHS, restricted expansion of the chest wall secondarily restricts lung expansion, effectively decreasing lung compliance. $#(Choice E)#  Tissue oxygen consumption does increase with increased body mass, but it is a relatively minor factor and would not cause hypoxemia or hypercapnia in the absence of hypoventilation. $#(Choice F)#  Right-to-left shunting (eg, Eisenmenger syndrome) results in hypoxemia with an elevated A-a gradient because a large percentage of cardiac output bypasses the alveolar capillaries and does not undergo gas exchange. $#Educational objective# Obesity hypoventilation syndrome commonly presents with chronic fatigue, dyspnea, and difficulty concentrating.  Patients will have BMI >30 kg/m2 and arterial blood gas while awake showing evidence of hypoventilation, including hypercapnia (PaCO2 >45 mm Hg) and usually hypoxemia (PaO2 <75 mm Hg).  The expected alveolar to arterial oxygen gradient is normal (4-15 mm Hg) with hypoventilation.  "

The dilation of alveolar ducts is homogenous, as opposed to the emphysema associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and is not associated with destruction of the alveolar walls. $Diminished elastic recoil and the collapse of supporting tissues around the airways cause a significant #increase# in #residual volume# (RV).

This value decreases to approximately 150 mm Hg in the trachea due to the partial pressure of water vapor.  @Normal@ #alveolar PO2 is 104 mm Hg#, which lies between the tracheal (150 mm Hg) and systemic venous blood (40 mm Hg) PO2 concentrations.  Likewise, normal #alveolar PCO2 is 40 mm Hg#, also between its respective tracheal (0 mm Hg) and systemic venous blood concentrations (45 mm Hg). $Transfer of O2 and CO2 between the blood and the alveoli depends on both perfusion and diffusion.  Under normal resting conditions, diffusion of O2 and CO2 is a quick process, with blood needing to traverse only one-third of the total pulmonary capillary length to completely equilibrate.  In this setting, gas exchange is perfusion-limited (ie, diffusion is fast enough that the total gas exchange depends only on the amount of blood supplied to the alveoli). $#Diffusion-limited gas exchange# takes place when diffusion across the alveolar membrane is relatively slow enough to become the major limitation to gas exchange.  This can occur with exercise (due to extremely high perfusion volumes that the diffusion rate cannot keep up with) or with pathologic conditions that disrupt the alveolar membrane (eg, pulmonary fibrosis, emphysema) and slow diffusion.  #CO2 diffuses 20 times faster than O2#, even when the alveolar membrane is somewhat disrupted; therefore, alveolar and capillary CO2 concentrations typically fully equilibrate while alveolar and capillary O2 concentrations do not. $In this experiment, there is a #large PO2 gradient# between the alveoli (104 mm Hg) and the pulmonary venous blood (70 mm Hg) but pulmonary venous #PCO2 is normal# (40 mm Hg), indicating incomplete gas exchange most likely due to diffusion impairment. $#(Choice A)#  @Bronchopulmonary shunting@ describes the normal small drop in PO2 and small increase in PCO2 that occurs due to the pulmonary veins receiving deoxygenated blood from the bronchial circulation.  However, this normally only results in about a 4 mm Hg drop in PO2 within the pulmonary veins. $#(Choice C)#  In normal alveolar ventilation and perfusion, the alveolar and pulmonary capillary PO2 rapidly reach equilibrium at 104 mm Hg. $#(Choice D)#  @Intrapulmonary shunting@ can occur when the alveoli fill with fluid (eg, pneumonia, pulmonary edema) or collapse (eg, atelectasis) and alveolar ventilation is essentially zero.  This patient's alveolar PO2 of 104 mm Hg is not consistent with shunting (alveolar PO2 equilibrates with venous blood at 40 mm Hg when ventilation is zero). $#(Choice E)#  @Poor alveolar ventilation@ (ie, hypoventilation) does not affect gas exchange between the alveoli and the blood; therefore, no O2 gradient is created. $#Educational objective# Gas exchange between the alveoli and pulmonary capillary blood depends on both perfusion and diffusion.  The exchange of O2 and CO2 in a normal individual at rest is perfusion-limited, so alveolar and capillary partial pressures are equal.  Situations in which O2 exchange becomes diffusion-limited (eg, emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis) cause a large gradient between alveolar and capillary PO2; PCO2 is less affected due to the greater diffusing capacity of CO2.

The initial responses to high altitude include: $• Peripheral chemoreceptors in the aorta and carotid body stimulate #hyperventilation# in an effort to increase arterial oxygenation (PaO2).  The hyperventilation also increases CO2 removal to decrease PaCO2 and cause respiratory alkalosis.  The alkalosis initially shifts the @hemoglobin dissociation curve@ to the left to increase O2 uptake in the lungs. $• Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction occurs to minimize ventilation-perfusion mismatching and optimize pulmonary O2 uptake.  This leads to #increased pulmonary vascular resistance#, which increases pulmonary arterial pressure. $• Sympathetic activity is increased, leading to #increased heart rate and cardiac output#. $• Despite the drop in PaCO2 (which encourages cerebral vasoconstriction), reduced PaO2 and marked tissue hypoxia lead to overall cerebral vasodilation to increase cerebral blood flow. $Additional responses occur over the next 24-48 hours: $• The kidneys increase HCO3− excretion (compensatory metabolic acidosis), which decreases blood pH.  Because central chemoreceptors inhibit ventilation when pH gets too high, the HCO3− excretion allows for additional hyperventilation. $• Hypoxemia suppresses aldosterone activity, which together with increased HCO3− excretion results in diuresis and total body volume loss.

In addition, the kidneys increase secretion of erythropoietin.  There is also upregulation of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) in cells throughout the body.  HIF stimulates erythropoiesis as well as increased angiogenesis in skeletal muscle and other tissues to improve O2 delivery. $Individuals who remain at high altitude for an extended period will experience the full benefit of increased erythropoietin secretion and upregulation of HIF, as secondary polycythemia (increased O2 carrying capacity) and angiogenesis are maximized after several weeks. $#Educational objective# An array of physiologic responses takes place to maintain adequate O2 delivery to the tissues in the hypoxic environment at high altitude.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient with #chronic obstructive pulmonary disease# (COPD) developed a #decrease in respiratory rate# as a result of oxygen supplementation.  Oxygen has a minimal effect on respiratory drive unless the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) drops below 60-70 mm Hg; therefore, the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) is the major stimulator of respiration in healthy individuals.  However, patients with long-standing COPD have decreased sensitivity to PaCO2 (due to chronic CO2 retention) and may also have profound hypoxemia (PaO2 <60 mm Hg); therefore, PaO2 levels can become a significant contributor to respiratory drive. $The depth and rate of respirations are controlled by the medullary respiratory center based on input from central and peripheral chemoreceptors and airway mechanoreceptors.  Peripheral chemoreceptors found in the #carotid and aortic bodies# are the primary sites for sensing PaO2 and are stimulated by hypoxemia.  When #supplemental oxygen# is administered, the rapid increase in PaO2 can #reduce peripheral chemoreceptor stimulation# and decrease the respiratory rate. $Reduced respiratory rate is a minor contributor to the @oxygen-induced hypercapnia@ that can occur in patients with COPD; increased ventilation-perfusion mismatch triggered by alleviation of pulmonary vasoconstriction in poorly ventilated areas is the major mechanism. $#(Choice B)#  Central chemoreceptors, located in the medulla, are more involved in the respiratory response to hypercapnia than to hypoxemia.  CO2 readily diffuses through the blood-brain barrier and forms hydrogen ions in the cerebrospinal fluid; the resulting decrease in pH is detected by medullary neurons, triggering an increase in respiration.  Because the blood-brain barrier is relatively impermeable to hydrogen ions, blood pH itself has little effect on central chemoreceptors. $#(Choice C)#  The juxtaglomerular apparatus is located in the kidneys and consists of juxtaglomerular cells and the macula densa.  It helps regulate renal blood flow and the glomerular filtration rate via renin secretion. $#(Choices D and E)#  Pulmonary stretch receptors include myelinated and unmyelinated C fibers in the lungs and airways.  These receptors regulate the duration of inspiration depending on the degree of lung distension (Hering-Breuer reflex). $#Educational objective# Arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) is the major stimulator of respiration in healthy individuals; even a slight increase in PaCO2 stimulates central chemoreceptors and triggers increased ventilation.  In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the response to PaCO2 is blunted and hypoxemia can contribute to respiratory drive.  Peripheral chemoreceptors are primarily responsible for sensing arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) and can be suppressed with oxygen administration.  ",

  "explanation_2": "$Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder due to mutations (eg, ΔF508) in the #CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)# protein.  The channel pore #opens# after binding of #2 ATP molecules#, allowing transport of chloride ions down the electrochemical gradient.  The movement of chloride establishes a membrane potential that draws sodium and water across the membrane as well.  By encouraging sodium chloride and water transport across epithelial membranes, the CFTR #hydrates mucosal surfaces# in the airways and bowel.  Mutations in the CFTR gene lead to intracellular protein degradation and decreased activity of the proteins that do reach the membrane.  This leads to #thick mucus# on the lining of epithelial cells, which results in clinical manifestations of chronic cough, recurrent pneumonias, and pancreatic damage. $The normal CFTR protein also plays a role in the production of hypotonic sweat.  In the eccrine gland, sweat is initially isotonic with the plasma, and normally sodium chloride is removed from the ductal lumen by CFTR.  In the absence of functional CFTR, patients with CF cannot remove salt from their sweat and therefore have #elevated sweat chloride# and sodium levels.  As early as the 17th century, increased mortality was recognized for children whose foreheads tasted salty.  Today, the sweat chloride test is frequently used to screen for CF. $#(Choice B)#  Cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels are important for photoreceptor and olfactory receptor neurons.  These nonselective channels are directly activated by cyclic nucleotides (eg, cyclic adenosine monophosphate [cAMP]).  In contrast, CFTR channels are modulated by cAMP-dependent phosphorylation, but they are not directly gated by cAMP binding. $#(Choice C)#  Mechanically gated (or stretch-activated) channels are ion channels that open in response to mechanical deformation of a cell membrane.  Touch and hearing depend on mechanically activated channel transduction of mechanical force into electrochemical signals. $#(Choice D)#  Temperature-gated ion channels open in response to heat and are responsible for human sensation of external temperature. $#(Choice E)#  Voltage-gated ion channels open and close in response to changes in electrical membrane potential and are permeable to various ions.  Congenital long QT syndrome is caused by a mutation in a voltage-gated potassium channel. $#Educational objective# Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene.  The CFTR protein is a transmembrane ATP-gated chloride channel.  Defects in CFTR result in thick, plugging mucous and elevated sodium and chloride levels in sweat.  "

The FVC and FEV1 are decreased as well.  However, the FEV1/FVC ratio is typically normal or increased as FEV1 decreases less than FVC (due to airway widening relative to the low lung volumes).  In addition, fibrosis causes a reduction in the diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide. $#(Choice A)#  Lung compliance is defined as the change in lung volume for a given change in pressure.

In a resting breath, a single tidal volume (TV) is exchanged.  With maximal inhalation, the curve includes both the TV and the @inspiratory reserve volume@ (IRV), which together equal the inspiratory capacity.  With maximal exhalation, the curve reflects the expulsion of the IRV and the TV, as well as the amount of additional air that can be expired, which is the expiratory reserve volume (ERV).  The air remaining in the lungs following full exhalation is the residual volume (RV). $In patients with COPD, the #RV is substantially increased# due to air trapping (eg, small airway collapse, mucous plugs) within floppy/inflamed airways.  The total lung capacity (#TLC#) can also increase over time due to emphysematous destruction of the lung parenchyma (with resulting expansion of alveolar airspaces), but this occurs primarily in advanced disease and to a #lesser extent# than the increase in RV (resulting in an #increased RV/TLC ratio#).  Increased airflow resistance and decreased pulmonary elastic recoil further contribute to hyperinflation of the lungs, causing COPD patients to breathe at higher baseline lung volumes (#higher FRC#). $#(Choice A)#  ERV is @decreased@ in obstructive lung disease, as less air can be forcefully exhaled due to airway obstruction and collapse. $#(Choices B, C, and D)#  Both forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) are decreased in obstructive lung disease due to airway obstruction.  Because FEV1 is decreased more than FVC, the FEV1/FVC ratio is also decreased (<0.7 in COPD). $#Educational objective# Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease causes air trapping and hyperinflation; consequently, these patients breathe at higher baseline lung volumes (higher functional residual capacity).

  "explanation_2": "$The human respiratory system undergoes significant changes during #normal aging#.  Pulmonary gas exchange becomes subtly impaired due to a sequence of gradual changes: $• Lung elastin degrades over time, leading to #alveolar simplification# (loss of surface area due to airspace enlargement).  Loss of elastic fiber support causes dynamic airflow obstruction resembling emphysema, leading to hyperinflation.  Therefore, inspired tidal volume has less opportunity to participate in gas exchange.  In other words, physiologic @dead space@ is #increased#. $• The muscles of respiration (chiefly the diaphragm) undergo remodeling over time, with atrophy of fast-twitch muscle fibers.  This leads to #lower peak force production# for maneuvers such as deep inspiration or coughing.  In combination with chest wall stiffening, this allows a small degree of #microatelectasis# to develop at the lung bases.  This results in #intrapulmonary shunting# (perfusion of blood through atelectatic [nonventilated] alveoli). $• This combination of increased dead space and increased shunt effect leads to greater #ventilation-perfusion mismatch#.  This ultimately causes the alveolar-arterial (A-a) oxygen gradient to progressively widen over decades.  When evaluating an #elevated A-a gradient#, patient age must be accounted for to determine whether it is within the expected limits of normal aging (expected A-a gradient = age/3 mm Hg). $• Because of the higher A-a gradient, arterial partial pressure of oxygen (#PaO2#) #falls# during aging (from 90 to 70 mm Hg by age 80).  Since PaO2 still remains on the plateau portion of the @oxyhemoglobin desaturation curve@, no change in SaO2 would be detected by simple pulse oximetry. $In contrast to decreased PaO2, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood (#PaCO2#) (reflecting total alveolar ventilation) is #not significantly changed#.  Although dead space increases and peak diaphragm strength is reduced, these changes are not enough to cause alveolar hypoventilation by themselves; resting hypoventilation (elevated PaCO2) at any age is always pathologic.  Instead, elderly persons are less able to compensate for high minute ventilation loads (eg, sepsis, thyrotoxicosis), making them prone to hypercapnia when acutely ill. $#Educational objective# Normal aging is characterized by a gradual increase in ventilation-perfusion mismatch (due to basilar microatelectasis causing shunt effect) and increased dead space (loss of alveolar surface area).  This manifests as a wider alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (ie, decline in PaO2) without hypoventilation (normal PaCO2).  ",

  "explanation_2": "$This patient most likely had a panic attack while trapped in the elevator.  Panic attacks are typically accompanied by #hyperventilation# with a resulting #decrease in arterial partial pressure of CO2# (PaCO2).  This hypocapnia can cause #decreased cerebral perfusion# with consequent neurologic sequelae, including generalized weakness, blurred vision, presyncope (ie, dizziness, lightheadedness), and syncope. $#Cerebral blood flow# (CBF) remains relatively constant over a wide range of perfusion pressures (cerebrovascular autoregulation) and is mainly influenced by arterial blood gas levels, particularly changes in PaCO2.  Hypercapnia triggers an increase in CBF (to aid in removal of toxins), and hypocapnia triggers a decrease in CBF.  In fact, because hypocapnia decreases CBF, mechanically ventilated patients with cerebral edema are often hyperventilated to decrease intracranial pressure and help prevent brain herniation. $CBF is less sensitive to the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2).  PaO2 has little influence on CBF until the level drops below 50 mm Hg, at which point a rapid increase in CBF is triggered. $#(Choices B and D)#  The total blood O2 content is predominantly made up of hemoglobin-bound O2 (determined by the blood hemoglobin level and PaO2) plus a small contribution of dissolved O2.  Hyperventilation increases the alveolar partial pressure of O2 and should somewhat increase (rather than decrease) both PaO2 and total blood O2 content. $#(Choice C)#  Hyperventilation produces respiratory alkalosis, marked by an increase in arterial pH. $#(Choice E)#  Disturbances that increase the alveolar-arterial O2 gradient include V/Q mismatch (eg, pulmonary embolism), diffusion limitation, and right-to-left shunting (eg, Eisenmenger syndrome).  Changes in ventilation rate (ie, hypo- or hyperventilation) have no effect on the alveolar-arterial O2 gradient. $#(Choice F)#  Increased arterial lactic acid content is a sign of tissue hypoxia (eg, due to sepsis or ischemia), which is unlikely in the setting of hyperventilation from a panic attack. $#Educational objective# Panic attacks are typically accompanied by hyperventilation, leading to hypocapnia.  Cerebral blood flow is directly related to the arterial partial pressure of CO2; therefore, hypocapnia can lead to reduced cerebral blood flow and symptoms of cerebral hypoperfusion (eg, blurred vision, dizziness, lightheadedness).

Hypoxemia triggers chemoreceptors in the carotid bodies to stimulate ventilation, and with hyperventilation, there is #increased exhalation of CO2#, leading to respiratory alkalosis.  Over several days, the kidneys compensate by increasing bicarbonate (HCO3−) excretion to #decrease serum HCO3−# and help normalize pH. $Hypoxemia persists because the low PiO2 allows hyperventilation to increase PaO2 only slightly.

In diffusion-limited gas exchange, the blood pO2 does not equilibrate with the alveolar pO2 by the end of its traversal through the alveolar capillaries. $#(Choice B)#  Dead space ventilation (wasted ventilation) refers to the volume of inspired air that does not participate in gas exchange.  Anatomic dead space refers to the volume of air that remains in the conducting parts of the airways, such as the bronchi and bronchioles.  Alveolar dead space refers to the volume of air in the alveoli that cannot participate in gas exchange due to poor perfusion. $#(Choice D)#  Perfusion-limited gas exchange occurs in the normal physiologic resting state, as equilibration of the blood with the alveolar gas is complete by the time the blood traverses one-third of the total pulmonary capillary length. $#(Choice E)#  The @hemoglobin dissociation curve@ shifts to the right in the systemic capillaries to increase oxygen delivery to the body tissues.  Increases in pCO2, temperature, and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate concentration cause right-shifting of the curve; the opposite conditions cause a left shift and favor oxygen loading in the lungs. $#Educational objective# The pO2 in the left atrium and ventricle is lower than that in the pulmonary capillaries due to mixing of oxygenated blood from the pulmonary veins with deoxygenated blood from the bronchial circulation and thebesian veins.

The #total O2# #content# of the blood (CaO2) is determined primarily by the #amount of hemoglobin# in the blood and its #percentage of O2# #saturation# (SaO2), which is directly influenced by changes in arterial O2 tension (PaO2) of the dissolved O2 according to the oxygen-hemoglobin @dissociation curve@.  Freely dissolved O2 normally accounts for only a very small proportion of the total O2 content of blood due to its low solubility in plasma. $This patient's #low CaO2# in the arterial blood but #normal PaO2# #and SaO2# are suggestive of #low hemoglobin# (ie, anemia), which reduces the total O2 content in the blood despite a normal partial pressure and percentage of O2 saturation.  A common cause of anemia in this patient's age group includes #chronic blood loss# (eg, heavy menses). $#(Choice B)#  Cyanide inhibits oxidative phosphorylation by inhibiting ferric iron (Fe3+) in cytochrome c oxidase, lowering O2 consumption in peripheral tissue.  Arterial PaO2, SaO2, and CaO2 remain unchanged, but venous O2 content rises and the arterial-venous O2 gradient falls.  Cyanide may also bind to the ferrous (Fe2+) iron of hemoglobin to form cyanhemoglobin but typically only in small amounts that do not appreciably change arterial O2 content. $#(Choice C)#  Primary polycythemia (polycythemia vera) is due to a genetic mutation causing increased red blood cell (RBC) production.  The hemoglobin within RBCs functions normally (normal SaO2), but there is a greater total amount of hemoglobin (increased CaO2).  There are no effects on dissolved oxygen (normal PaO2). $#(Choice D)#  The O2 tension in high-altitude settings is relatively low compared to that at sea level.  Recent exposure to a high-altitude environment would result in reduced alveolar O2 tension, leading to reduced PaO2 and SaO2, with a corresponding decrease in CaO2. $#(Choice E)#  Right to left intrapulmonary shunting occurs when venous blood flows through inadequately ventilated alveoli (eg, pulmonary edema).  This blood remains deoxygenated as it reenters the systemic circulation.

Causes of respiratory acidosis without compensation include any disorder that causes #acute hypoventilation# (eg, opioid overdose with depression of respiratory drive). $#(Choices A and E)#  Metabolic acidosis is indicated by low pH and low serum HCO3−.  The respiratory compensation involves hyperventilation to breathe off CO2 and help increase pH.  Respiratory compensation for metabolic disturbances begins right away and is usually maximized within hours; therefore, full (or nearly full) compensation is expected in both the acute and chronic setting unless the patient's breathing is compromised. $#(Choice B)#  Metabolic alkalosis is indicated by high pH and high HCO3−.  The respiratory compensation involves hypoventilation to retain CO2 and decrease pH. $#(Choice C)#  This patient's low pH and high PaCO2 are consistent with respiratory acidosis, but the normal HCO3− indicates that renal compensation has not yet occurred. $#(Choice D)#  Respiratory alkalosis is indicated by high pH and low PaCO2.  The metabolic compensation involves increased HCO3− excretion by the kidneys to help decrease pH and requires approximately 72 hours to complete. $#Educational objective# Respiratory acidosis presents with low pH and high PaCO2.

  "explanation_2": "$The partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli (PAO2) is normally 104 mm Hg, and due to the high rate of O2 diffusion across the alveolar-capillary membrane, the O2 level in the alveolar capillary blood rapidly equilibrates with the PAO2.  However, the blood O2 level then drops slightly due to the addition of deoxygenated blood from the @bronchial circulation@; therefore, the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2) is normally around 100 mm Hg.  This discrepancy between alveolar and arterial O2 concentration is termed the alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradient.  In healthy individuals, a #normal A-a gradient# is typically between #4 and 15 mm Hg#, with older individuals having higher normal values due to an age-related decline in O2-diffusing capacity. $This patient has low PaO2 and PAO2 with a normal A-a gradient (68 − 60 = 8), indicating that his low PaO2 is directly due to low PAO2.  Possible causes of hypoxemia in the setting of a @normal A-a gradient@ include #alveolar hypoventilation# and low partial pressure of inspired oxygen (PiO2) (ie, high altitude).  Common causes of alveolar hypoventilation include suppressed central respiratory drive (eg, sedative overdose) and diseases that decrease inspiratory capacity (eg, myasthenia gravis, obesity). $#(Choices B and D)#  @Dead space ventilation@ is one extreme of ventilation-perfusion mismatch that occurs when the alveoli are adequately ventilated, but there is no alveolar perfusion (eg, pulmonary embolism).  An @intrapulmonary shunt@ is the other extreme of ventilation-perfusion mismatch that occurs when blood perfuses alveoli that are not ventilated (eg, pneumonia, pulmonary edema).  The A-a gradient is elevated in ventilation-perfusion mismatch. $#(Choice C)#  Gas diffusion is impaired in diseases that disrupt the alveolar-capillary membrane, such as alveolar hyaline membrane disease (acutely) or emphysema (chronically).  @Diffusion impairment@ causes an elevated A-a gradient because O2 cannot be effectively transported into the blood. $#(Choice E)#  A left-to-right shunt occurs when oxygenated blood from the left side of the heart is shunted into the right side of the heart (eg, atrial or ventricular septal defect).  Left-to-right shunts do not cause hypoxemia; however, if left untreated, they may progress into a right-to-left shunt (ie, Eisenmenger syndrome) with hypoxemia, cyanosis, and an elevated A-a gradient. $#Educational objective# There are 5 major causes of hypoxemia (low arterial partial pressure of oxygen [PaO2]): alveolar hypoventilation, low partial pressure of inspired oxygen, ventilation-perfusion mismatch, diffusion impairment, and right-to-left shunting.  The A-a gradient is normal with alveolar hypoventilation and low partial pressure of inspired oxygen, which helps distinguish these causes from other causes of hypoxemia.  ",

The fibers can stretch to several times their length and recoil back to their original size once stretching forces are withdrawn.  Elastin assembly is closely related to that of collagen.  Similar to collagen, elastin is synthesized as a large polypeptide precursor (tropoelastin) composed of about 700, mostly nonpolar, amino acids (eg, glycine, alanine, valine) #(choice D).#  Elastin also contains proline and lysine residues; however, in contrast to those found in collagen, few of these amino acids are hydroxylated #(choice C).# $After tropoelastin is formed, it is secreted into the extracellular space where it interacts with microfibrils (fibrillin) that function as a scaffold.

  "explanation_2": "$The transition from point 1 to 2 on the graph represents the loading of O2 onto partially deoxygenated hemoglobin as occurs in the #lungs#.  At very low partial pressure of O2 (pO2), hemoglobin is mostly deoxygenated, and binding of O2 molecules is relatively difficult (as indicated by the early flatness of the curve).  As the partial pressure of O2 increases, O2 binds to 1 of the 4 binding sites on hemoglobin and #increases the O2-binding affinity# of the other available binding sites (steepening of the curve), a phenomenon known as #cooperative binding#.  Subsequently, additional O2 molecules bind more easily as the pO2 increases until hemoglobin becomes nearly fully saturated. $The binding of O2 molecules to hemoglobin in the lungs has two consequences, known as the #Haldane effect#: $• The affinity of hemoglobin for CO2 is decreased, resulting in unloading of CO2 from hemoglobin (this accounts for a small percentage of overall CO2 in the blood and is not pictured above). $• The acidity of the hemoglobin molecule is increased; in response, #protons (H+ ions) are released# from the hemoglobin binding sites. $The H+ ions combine with bicarbonate ions (the primary form of CO2 in the blood) in the lungs to facilitate the production of water (H2O) and CO2.  The CO2 is then transferred to the alveoli and expired while oxygen is taken up by hemoglobin. $In the peripheral tissues, high levels of CO2 create an increase in ambient acidity that shifts the @hemoglobin dissociation curve@ to the right and facilitates the unloading of O2 (#Bohr effect#).  The CO2 (and water) are converted into H+ and HCO3−.  The H+ ions are carried by hemoglobin while the HCO3− is transferred to the plasma for transport back to the lungs. $#(Choice A)#  In the lungs, chloride ions shift out of red blood cells and into the plasma in exchange for HCO3−.  These chloride ions are not bound to or released by hemoglobin. $#(Choice B)#  Heme is not released from hemoglobin during O2 loading or unloading.  However, it is released during the normal destruction of aged red blood cells in the spleen. $#(Choice C)#  O2 molecules bind to hemoglobin to increase hemoglobin saturation. $#(Choice D)#  2,3-diphosphoglycerate contains 2 phosphate groups and binds to hemoglobin to facilitate unloading of O2 in the tissues.  However, phosphate molecules are not directly bound or released by hemoglobin. $#Educational objective# The binding of O2 to hemoglobin increases the affinity for binding of subsequent O2 molecules (cooperative binding).  In the lungs, the binding of O2 to hemoglobin drives the release of H+ and CO2 from hemoglobin (Haldane effect).  In the peripheral tissues, high concentrations of CO2 and H+ facilitate O2 unloading from hemoglobin (Bohr effect).  ",

This mutation causes #impaired post-translational processing# (eg, improper folding and glycosylation) of CFTR, which is detected by the endoplasmic reticulum.

The phenomenon prevents atelectasis and end-expiratory collapse and increases pulmonary compliance. $In a fetus, efflux of lung fluid into amniotic fluid enables testing of markers of lung maturity.  Until 33 weeks gestation, the lecithin and sphingomyelin levels are about equal.  After 33 weeks, the lecithin levels rise dramatically compared to sphingomyelin.  A lecithin-to-sphingomyelin ratio >1.9 is indicative of mature fetal lungs. $Premature infants born at <32 weeks gestation are at significant risk of surfactant deficiency.

  "explanation_2": "$This neonate has respiratory distress with #asymmetric breath sounds# and a scaphoid abdomen, findings concerning for #congenital diaphragmatic hernia# (CDH).  This condition develops in the first trimester due to incomplete fusion of the pleuroperitoneal folds, which permits herniation of abdominal contents into the thoracic cavity (most commonly the left side).  Compression of the developing lung results in #pulmonary hypoplasia#, or underdevelopment of lung tissue. $Neonates typically develop respiratory distress (eg, tachypnea, retractions) within hours of birth and decreased unilateral breath sounds; a #scaphoid abdomen# from superiorly shifted abdominal viscera is common.  Chest x-ray findings include the presence of #thoracic bowel loops# with minimal or absent lung markings and an indistinct hemidiaphragm on the affected side.  In addition, the distal end of a #feeding tube# may be seen within the #thorax# instead of the abdomen. $#(Choices A and D)#  Pulmonary surfactant deficiency occurs in premature (not term) neonates and causes @respiratory distress syndrome (RDS)@.  X-ray reveals ground glass opacities and air bronchograms.  RDS can be complicated by bronchopulmonary dysplasia, characterized by dilation of airspaces with bronchiolar metaplasia.  Patients with CDH may also develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia, but this is a late complication (age >30 days) and is not present at birth. $#(Choice B)#  Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure reflects left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and is increased in left-sided congenital heart disease (eg, aortic stenosis).  Poor perfusion would be expected, but a scaphoid abdomen and abnormally placed feeding tube would not be seen. $#(Choice C)#  @Pneumothorax@ is characterized by loss of negative intrapleural pressure and can cause asymmetric breath sounds and respiratory distress.  Although a mediastinal shift can also be seen on imaging, a visceral pleural edge with the absence of distal lung markings would be expected. $#Educational objective# Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (herniation of abdominal contents into the thorax) causes pulmonary hypoplasia from compression of the lungs.  Neonates present with respiratory distress shortly after birth.  X-ray findings include thoracic bowel loops; the distal end of a feeding tube may also be seen within the thorax.  ",

  "explanation_2": "$#Ciliated mucosal epithelium# lines the pulmonary airways from the trachea to the respiratory bronchioles.  The airway epithelium gradually changes from pseudostratified ciliated columnar to ciliated simple cuboidal by the level of the terminal bronchioles.  #Ciliated cells# continue to be present through the proximal portions of the #respiratory bronchioles#, but are not present in the alveolar ducts or in the alveoli themselves.  This arrangement is important because cilia function to propel mucus toward the pharynx.  The presence of cilia beyond the most distal mucus-producing cells (goblet cells end before the terminal bronchioles) prevents bronchiolar mucus accumulation and airflow obstruction. $#(Choice A)#  The rings of hyaline cartilage that encircle the trachea are replaced by cartilaginous plates in the bronchi.  These rings and plates help keep the larger airways open and end at the termination of the smallest bronchi (they are not found in bronchioles). $#(Choice C)#  Goblet cells are mucus-secreting cells that are present from the trachea down to the larger bronchioles.  They are not found within the terminal bronchioles, which are lined by club cells. $#(Choices D and E)#  The submucosal mucous glands and serous glands are found from the trachea to the distal-most bronchi and produce mucinous components that help trap inhaled particles.  They are not present within the bronchioles. $#Educational objective# Bronchi have a ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium with mucin-secreting goblet cells and submucosal mucoserous glands.  The airway epithelium gradually changes to ciliated simple cuboidal by the level of the terminal bronchioles.  Bronchioles lack glands and cartilage, and the number of goblet cells decreases distally, ending before the terminal bronchioles.  Ciliated epithelium persists up to the respiratory bronchioles.

  "explanation_2": "This patient with respiratory failure, hypoxemia, and thickened bronchial walls with inflammatory infiltrates and mucous gland enlargement likely had #chronic bronchitis#.  Chronic bronchitis is characterized by chronic, productive cough with airflow limitation and is part of the spectrum of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  It is most commonly caused by #tobacco smoking#.  Chronic irritation by other inhaled environmental substances, such as air pollutants and grain, cotton, or silica dusts, can also contribute to its development.  Biopsy typically shows #thickened bronchial walls# with predominantly #lymphocytic infiltrates#, mucous gland enlargement with increased numbers of goblet cells (#increasing mucus production#), and patchy #squamous metaplasia# of the bronchial mucosa. $#(Choice A)#  Patients with allergic asthma can develop pathologic remodeling of the bronchial wall, which includes thickening of the bronchial epithelium, basement membrane, and bronchial smooth muscle as well as edema, inflammatory infiltrates, and submucosal mucous gland enlargement.  However, the infiltrates consist predominantly of eosinophils and mast cells.  In addition, although asthma is a risk factor for chronic bronchitis, smoking is a much more common cause. $#(Choice C)#  Genetic factors are not known to strongly predispose to chronic bronchitis.  Genetic mutation causing alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency can lead to panacinar emphysema; however, chronic bronchitis is not a significant component of the disease. $#(Choice D)#  Repeated bronchial/bronchiolar bacterial and viral infections can contribute to the development of chronic bronchitis, although less significantly than can smoking.  Tobacco smoke predisposes to infection by impairing ciliary clearance and directly damaging the respiratory epithelium. $#(Choices E and F)#  Nickel is a carcinogen, and occupational exposure is associated with nasal and lung cancers.  However, neoplastic transformation itself does not contribute to the development of chronic bronchitis.  Although this patient's history of nickel mining is also suggestive of silica dust exposure, smoking is the most important risk factor for chronic bronchitis. $#Educational objective# Thickened bronchial walls, lymphocytic infiltration, mucous gland enlargement, and patchy squamous metaplasia of the bronchial mucosa are features of chronic bronchitis.  Tobacco smoking is the leading cause of chronic bronchitis.  "
