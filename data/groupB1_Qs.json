  "explanation_2": "$This patient sustained a puncture wound and subsequently developed #inflammatory lymphadenopathy# in a draining lymph node, suggesting bacterial infection with lymphadenitis.  Lymph nodes serve as sentinel sites for generation of the #adaptive immune response#.  Large, unprocessed foreign antigens are displayed by #follicular dendritic cells# in the draining lymph node.  B cells recognize, bind to, and process the large antigens into smaller peptides that can be displayed on major histocompatibility II receptors to naïve T cells.  T cells subsequently differentiate into T-helper cells and secrete cytokines that promote the survival and proliferation of the antigen-specific B cells, leading to the generation of #germinal centers#. $Germinal centers are the sites where #B cells# compete for survival based upon the ability to bind with high affinity to a foreign antigen.  Within these regions, B cells rapidly #proliferate #and undergo #somatic hypermutation# (immunoglobulin mutation); this dramatically expands the B cell population capable of binding with high affinity to antigens from the infecting microorganism.  Antigen-specific B cells eventually evolve into plasma cells that secrete high affinity antibodies against the invading pathogen. $Because the formation of germinal centers results in significant cellular recruitment, patients generally develop lymph node swelling (#lymphadenopathy#) in the draining lymph node.  In addition, the release of large quantities of cytokines frequently causes #pain and inflammation# in that area. $#(Choice A)#  Atypical B-cell proliferation is seen in many forms of lymphoma.  However, the lymphadenopathy is usually painless and not associated with erythema because B-cell proliferation without antigen stimulation is not associated with significant inflammatory cytokine release. $#(Choice B)#  Granulomatous lymphadenitis can be seen in noninfectious (eg, sarcoidosis) or infectious (eg, tularemia, catscratch disease, cryptococcal) diseases.  This patient with a recent puncture wound in the foot and evidence of inflammatory lymphadenopathy in a draining lymph node is far more likely to have a typical bacterial infection than an atypical granulomatous infection. $#(Choice C)#  Necrotizing lymphadenitis (eg, buboes) in the groin can be caused by certain serovars of Chlamydia trachomatis.  However, this infection is typically seen in tropical and subtropical regions and would not be associated with a recent foot puncture wound. $#(Choice D)#  T cells primarily reside in the lymph node paracortex.  Paracortical hyperplasia is typically seen with infections primarily dependent on the cell-mediated response (eg, viral infection).  Although the paracortical region might expand slightly in bacterial infections, lymphadenopathy is primarily driven by the formation of germinal centers. $#Educational objective# Germinal centers are the sites where activated B cells proliferate and undergo affinity maturation during generation of a humoral immune response.  The formation of multiple germinal centers is typically marked by lymphadenopathy, pain, and inflammation in the affected lymph node due to cellular recruitment and the release of inflammatory cytokines.

  "explanation_2": "This patient has a purpuric rash, #arthralgia#, and signs of #renal disease# (ie, hypertension, proteinuria), which are classic features of #Henoch-Schönlein purpura# (HSP), or IgA vasculitis.  Other @common findings@ can include colicky #abdominal pain# and hematuria. $HSP is an immune-mediated type III hypersensitivity reaction in which #deposition# of #IgA immune complexes# (which may form in response to a preceding upper respiratory infection) triggers complement activation and inflammation of #small vessels# throughout the body.  Vasculitis within the papillary dermis manifests as nonthrombocytopenic #palpable purpura# on dependent areas, such as the buttocks and lower extremities.  Histopathology shows @leukocytoclastic vasculitis@, in which small superficial blood vessels are damaged by perivascular #neutrophilic inflammation#, resulting in fibrin deposition in the vessel wall (ie, #fibrinoid necrosis#) and red blood cell extravasation.  Neutrophil breakdown (leukocytoclasis) leads to the formation of perivascular nuclear debris.  Immunofluorescence reveals IgA and C3 in the vessel walls. $HSP is usually benign and self-limiting, particularly in children.  However, adults are at increased risk for renal complications, such as nephrotic syndrome and acute kidney injury. $#(Choice A)#  Disseminated intravascular coagulation is characterized by abundant intravascular fibrin deposition (ie, fibrin thrombi) in the absence of vascular inflammation.  It occurs most often in the setting of trauma, sepsis, or malignancy and presents with bleeding (eg, purpura) due to thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy.  Although fibrin thrombi may be seen with HSP, extensive inflammatory infiltrate is also present. $#(Choice B)#  Obliterative endarteritis with lymphocytes and plasma cells is seen with later-stage @syphilis@, which can cause arthralgias, renal abnormalities, and a rash; however, classic skin findings include scaly red/brown macules or papules that are typically diffuse and involve the palms and soles.  In contrast, this patient has purpuric lesions localized to the lower extremities. $#(Choice C)#  Perivascular necrotizing granulomas with eosinophilic infiltration are characteristic of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss syndrome), a small- to medium-vessel vasculitis.

The resulting sudden and massive release of inflammatory mediators (eg, histamine, leukotrienes) into the circulation can quickly lead to #airway obstruction# (eg, bronchospasm, oropharyngeal edema) and #distributive shock# (ie, profound peripheral vasodilation). $Although some patients (eg, those who experience rapid cardiovascular collapse) have no significant gross autopsy findings, the most common abnormal findings resulting from anaphylaxis include the following: $• #Laryngeal and/or pharyngeal edema# $• #Hyperinflation of the lungs# (due to air trapping from airway obstruction) $• Cerebral edema (due to cerebral hypoxia) $Cutaneous abnormalities (eg, urticaria, flushing) may also be present because anaphylaxis often involves the skin. $To help confirm the diagnosis, patient serum can be sent for tryptase level analysis.  #Tryptase#, a mediator released from mast cells, is elevated in many cases of anaphylaxis. $#(Choice A)#  In most cases of sudden death due to acute myocardial infarction (MI), death is due to an arrhythmia resulting from acute coronary occlusion, and an occlusive thrombus is often present on autopsy.  Although cerebral edema could be present from hypoxia, an acute MI would not be expected to cause laryngeal edema and hyperinflated lungs. $#(Choice C)#  Patients with sudden death from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation could have hyperinflation of the lungs due to airway obstruction, as well as cerebral edema due to hypoxia.  However, because COPD is a disease of the lower airway, it would not be expected to cause upper airway (eg, laryngeal) edema. $#(Choice D)#  Meningococcal meningitis can cause cerebral edema, as found on autopsy, but also commonly causes a purulent exudate in the meninges.  It would not be expected to cause laryngeal edema or lung hyperinflation. $#(Choice E)#  Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy is not well understood but is believed to be caused by central apnea or cardiac arrythmias.  It is the most common seizure-related cause of death and is frequently associated with cerebral edema, which is demonstrated on autopsy.  However, laryngeal edema and lung hyperinflation are not expected.  In addition, tongue lacerations and cutaneous abrasions are frequently present. $#Educational objective# Anaphylaxis (type 1 hypersensitivity) can quickly lead to respiratory compromise (eg, bronchospasm, oropharyngeal edema) and distributive shock.

Given her normal platelet count, which excludes Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, her findings are most consistent with #hyper-IgE syndrome #(Job syndrome), an autosomal dominant, primary immunodeficiency disorder. $Hyper-IgE syndrome is characterized by impaired JAK-STAT signaling, leading to defective differentiation and function of #T-helper cell type 17# (Th17).  Th17 cells normally produce IL-17, which activates #neutrophils# to #migrate# to the site of infection.  Without this cytokine, neutrophil function is impaired, causing recurrent skin and #sinopulmonary infections# most commonly due to Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans.  Neutrophil-induced inflammation is absent, so #abscesses# are often nontender (ie, #cold#), and patients are typically afebrile with a normal leukocyte count, as opposed to the leukocytosis expected with infection. $In addition to immunodeficiency, #chronic atopic dermatitis# is a prominent feature of hyper-IgE syndrome and typically begins in early infancy.  Colonization of S aureus and C albicans on the skin triggers mast cell histamine release, causing severe pruritus and an eczematous rash.  Patients characteristically have #eosinophilia# and #elevated IgE# related to the dermatitis, but #other immunoglobulin levels# are usually #normal#.  A low Th17 count supports the diagnosis, and molecular genetic testing is confirmatory. $#(Choice A)#  All immunoglobulin levels are decreased/absent in X-linked agammaglobulinemia due to impaired B-cell maturation.  Severe sinopulmonary and invasive bacterial infections begin in infancy, and failure to thrive is typical.  Without immunoglobulin replacement most children will have near fatal infections early in life. $#(Choice B)#  Chronic eczema without an underlying immunodeficiency can cause elevated IgE, and IgG may also be high if the rash is superinfected.  However, the affected area would be erythematous and tender, unlike this patient's cold abscess, making isolated atopic disease unlikely. $#(Choice C)#  Hyper-IgM syndrome, in which immunoglobulin class-switching is impaired due to CD40 ligand deficiency, typically presents in infancy with sinopulmonary and opportunistic infections.  Recurrent cold skin abscesses do not typically occur. $#(Choice E)#  Selective IgA deficiency can cause recurrent sinopulmonary infections and is associated with an increased risk for atopy.  However, skin infections would not be expected. $#Educational objective# Hyper-IgE syndrome is characterized by elevated IgE levels and is caused by impaired neutrophil activation and migration due to a defect in T-helper cell type 17 cells.  Typical findings include noninflammatory (ie, cold) abscesses, recurrent sinopulmonary infections, and chronic atopic dermatitis. "

  "explanation_2": "This patient with #impaired renal function# within the first few weeks following renal transplant likely has #acute rejection#.  This process is mostly #cell-mediated# and results from #sensitization of recipient T cells# to donor graft MHC antigens (human leukocyte antigens).  Humoral (antibody-mediated) immunity may also be involved in acute rejection, but it typically plays a smaller role. $Acute rejection usually occurs within the #first 6 months# following transplantation.  Patients often have an asymptomatic rise in serum creatinine, but they may also have low-grade fever, malaise, joint pains, and graft tenderness.  Histology reveals a #dense lymphocytic infiltrate# sometimes accompanied by vascular inflammation.  Acute rejection is typically reversible and usually treated with high-dose glucocorticoids.  Chronic immunosuppression with a calcineurin inhibitor–based regimen (eg, tacrolimus plus mycophenolate and low-dose prednisone) helps prevent acute rejection episodes. $#(Choices A and B)#  Graft versus host disease (GVHD) primarily involves activation of donor T cells within grafted tissue against recipient (host) antigens.  B cells are also involved to a lesser extent.  GVHD typically occurs only when the recipient lacks a competent immune response (eg, in the setting of bone marrow transplant). $#(Choice C)#  Host B-cell sensitization against donor antigens results in a humoral antibody response and is sometimes involved in acute rejection.  Histology is expected to show deposition of complement (eg, C4d), neutrophilic infiltrate, and necrotizing vasculitis; this patient's mononuclear (lymphocytic) infiltrate is consistent with a cell-mediated T-cell response.  Although it can occur acutely, the humoral response tends to be more involved in chronic rejection, which occurs months to years following transplant. $#(Choice E)#  Preformed antibodies against graft ABO or other antigens can lead to hyperacute graft rejection.  Because the antibodies are already present in the recipient circulation, there is rapid response against the donor graft, leading to arterial fibrinoid necrosis and vascular thrombosis with graft mottling and cyanosis.  Thorough crossmatching prior to transplant makes hyperacute rejection a rare occurrence. $#Educational objective# Organ rejection can be hyperacute, acute, or chronic.  Acute rejection most often occurs within weeks or up to 6 months after transplant and is predominantly cell-mediated, involving sensitization of host T lymphocytes against donor MHC antigens.  There is typically graft dysfunction with histology showing a dense, mononuclear (ie, lymphocytic) infiltrate. "

Binding of IFN-γ to its receptor on a macrophage causes transcription of IFN-γ-regulated genes through activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway.  The result is upregulation of IL-12 production, enhanced mycobacterial intracellular killing in phagolysosomes, and production of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) which promotes formation of granulomas. $Autosomal recessive deficiencies of the IFN-γ receptor (or other elements of this pathway) result in #disseminated mycobacterial disease# (or BCG infection if the vaccine is administered) in infancy or early childhood.

However, because neutralizing antibodies are required to clear Enterovirus, severe #life-threatening infection# can occur in infants with a primary humoral immunodeficiency such as #X-linked agammaglobulinemia# (XLA). $XLA, or Bruton agammaglobulinemia, is due to a mutation in the BTK gene encoding Bruton tyrosine kinase.

Therefore, patients have #low circulating B lymphocytes# and #low immunoglobulin levels#. $In addition to enteroviral infection, XLA also increases the risk for recurrent #sinopulmonary infections# by encapsulated bacteria (eg, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b), which require antibody opsonization for @phagocytosis@.

The cutaneous findings are consistent with @a wheal-and-flare reaction@, an erythematous papule or plaque often with central pallor (wheal) and peripheral erythema (flare). $During initial allergen exposure, a patient predisposed to an allergic response will undergo antibody class switching from IgM to #IgE antibodies# specific for the allergen.  IgE produced by B lymphocytes and plasma cells then binds to high-affinity IgE Fc receptors on #basophils# and #mast cells#.  Re-exposure to the allergen results in cross-linking of bound IgE antibodies with subsequent degranulation and release of inflammatory mediators (eg, #histamine#, proteases [tryptase], leukotrienes, prostaglandins).  Localized vasodilation and increased vascular permeability result in the characteristic wheal-and-flare lesions.  In severe cases, widespread release of these agents can also cause systemic vasodilation, bronchoconstriction, and massive fluid shifts, leading to anaphylactic shock and potentially death. $#(Choice A)#  C3b, the larger subunit produced by cleavage of complement component 3, binds to pathogens and enhances phagocytosis.

  "explanation_2": "$#Secretory IgA# is the major antibody associated with #mucosal immunity#.  Upon intestinal exposure to a novel antigen, B cells found in mesenteric lymph nodes and Peyer's patches become activated and preferentially migrate to the lamina propria underlying the intestinal mucosa.  There, they become fully differentiated plasma cells that begin to synthesize IgA dimers (linked by #J chain#).  These IgA dimers then bind to the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) found on the basolateral surface of intestinal epithelial cells and undergo transcytosis.  As the linked IgA dimer is released into the intestinal lumen, a portion of pIgR remains attached to the antibody (#secretory component#), forming the complete secretory IgA molecule. $Stimulation of local secretory IgA production is best promoted when the corresponding mucosal surfaces are #directly stimulated# by the antigen.  In addition, live attenuated vaccines generally produce stronger immune responses than killed vaccines by acting as a persistent stimulus that better activates helper and cytotoxic T cells.  As a result, the #live attenuated oral# (Sabin) poliovirus vaccine generates a much more robust oropharyngeal and intestinal mucosal IgA response than the inactivated poliovirus (Salk) vaccine. $#(Choice A)#  Cerebrospinal fluid IgG antibody levels can increase due to a rise in local production (eg, multiple sclerosis, viral CNS infections) or inflammation of the blood-brain barrier (eg, trauma, meningitis), leading to excessive leakage of plasma proteins. $#(Choices C, D, and E)#  Serum IgA (mainly monomeric), IgG, and IgM increase with both forms of the polio vaccine and are protective against viral dissemination.  Serum IgG and IgM can also be secreted by the mucosa although to a lesser extent than secretory IgA (explaining why most patients with selective IgA deficiency are asymptomatic). $#Educational objective# The live attenuated oral (Sabin) poliovirus vaccine produces a stronger mucosal secretory IgA immune response than does the inactivated poliovirus (Salk) vaccine.  This increase in mucosal IgA offers immune protection at the site of viral entry by inhibiting attachment to intestinal epithelial cells.  "

  "explanation_2": "Exposure to a pathogen or foreign substance (eg, venom) generates innate and adaptive immune responses.  The humoral component of the adaptive immune response culminates when activated CD4 cells prompt antigen-specific B cells to undergo somatic hypermutation and class switching, thereby generating a #pool# of highly specific IgG antibodies that neutralize #several different epitopes# on the antigen.  This is considered a #polyclonal response# because a number of different clonal plasma cells each produce a specific antibody that targets a different epitope on the antigen. $In contrast, #monoclonal# antibodies are derived from a single population of plasma cells and bind only a single epitope on the antigen.  Naturally occurring monoclonal antibodies are typically seen in pathologic conditions such as plasma cell dyscrasias (eg, #multiple myeloma#).  In the laboratory setting, myeloma cells can be fused to antigen-specific plasma cells to generate a large amount of monoclonal antibody against a particular antigen.  However, because monoclonal antibodies bind only a @single epitope type@ on an antigen, they typically generate a #less potent# immune response than polyclonal antibodies, which bind multiple different epitope types on an antigen. $#(Choice A)#  @Affinity@ is the binding strength of the immunoglobulin for a single epitope on the antigen; the greater the binding strength, the greater the affinity.  Each individual type of immunoglobulin in the polyclonal pool will have the same affinity as the monoclonal version of the immunoglobulin. $#(Choice B)#  Avidity is the strength of binding between the entire immunoglobulin and the antigen.  Therefore, IgM usually has greater avidity than IgG because IgM binds to up to 10 portions of the antigen while IgG binds to only 2.  However, avidity between individual IgG antibodies in a polyclonal versus monoclonal pool is the same. $#(Choice D)#  Valency is the number of epitope binding sites on each antibody.  IgM antibodies have 10 valence sites, and IgG antibodies have 2.  Each monoclonal and polyclonal IgG antibody has 2 valence sites; valency is no different between these pools. $#Educational objective# Plasma contains polyclonal antibodies, a pool of antibodies that bind different epitopes on an antigen.  In contrast, monoclonal antibodies bind a single epitope on an antigen.  Polyclonal antibodies are often better at neutralizing complex antigens because they contain antibodies that bind several different epitopes.  ",

  "explanation_2": "This kidney transplant recipient with #progressive decline in renal function# most likely has #chronic allograft rejection#.  The process is a #mixed cell-mediated and antibody-mediated# response and can occur anytime from #several months to years# posttransplantation. $Following transplant, T cells are activated and recipient antibodies are created against graft HLA and other antigens.  The activated T cells can initially cause cell-mediated acute rejection, which is generally reversible via an increase in immunosuppression (eg, high-dose glucocorticoids).  Chronic rejection represents progression of cell-mediated and antibody-mediated inflammation (eg, via activation of complement and recruitment of neutrophils) to the point that #irreversible# renal damage takes place; the kidney grossly decreases in size, and histopathology shows #obliterative vascular wall thickening# with #tubular atrophy# and #interstitial fibrosis#. $Due to increased sodium retention, declining renal function in chronic rejection is also commonly accompanied by new or worsening #hypertension#.  Chronic rejection is the most common cause of renal graft failure following transplant. $#(Choice A)#  A dense, interstitial, mononuclear (lymphocytic) infiltrate is characteristic of acute allograft rejection, which is most often a primarily T cell–mediated process.  Acute rejection typically occurs <6 months after transplant but can occur later in a patient in whom posttransplant immunosuppression has been stopped. $#(Choice B)#  Glomerular injury in chronic rejection is predominantly ischemic, and crescent formation is not typically observed.  Crescents develop mainly in anti–glomerular basement membrane antibody–mediated, antineutrophilic cytoplasmic autoantibody–associated, or immune complex–mediated glomerulonephritis. $#(Choice D)#  Muddy brown casts can be seen with acute tubular necrosis, which usually manifests as acute (rather than gradual) kidney injury.  Tubular hypertrophy may be present during the recovery phase.  These findings are not typical of chronic rejection. $#(Choice E)#  Vascular fibrinoid necrosis with capillary thrombotic occlusion occurs in hyperacute rejection, which is a rapid and profound form of antibody-mediated rejection caused by preformed antibodies to graft antigens.  Chronic rejection is a more gradual antibody-mediated process resulting from sensitization that occurs after a transplant has taken place. $#Educational objective# Chronic renal allograft rejection manifests months to years after a transplant and presents with worsening hypertension and a gradual decline in renal function.  It involves a chronic cell-mediated and antibody-mediated response against donor antigens and leads to obliterative vascular wall thickening, tubular atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis.

  "explanation_2": "$T-lymphocytes, or thymocytes, are initially produced in the bone marrow, but they migrate from that location to mature during the first trimester of gestation in the thymus.  In the thymus, the processes of T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement, positive selection, negative selection, and expression of extracellular membrane markers and co-stimulatory molecules occurs.  Pro-T cells arrive at the thymus as \"double negative\" cells – indicating that they lack both CD4 and CD8 antigens and begin their differentiation in the subcapsular zone.  Next, the process of TCR beta gene rearrangement occurs with simultaneous expression of both CD4 and CD8.  Once in thymic cortex, the alpha genes rearrange to produce a functional alpha-beta TCR.  Subsequently, the processes of positive and negative selection occur with cells that fail either of these tests being eliminated by apoptosis. $Positive selection is the process by which only T cells expressing a TCR that is able to bind self MHC are allowed to survive.  Those cells expressing a TCR that is not specific for self MHC are signaled for elimination by apoptosis.  This process occurs after TCR DNA rearrangement and prior to the process of negative selection.  It occurs in the thymic cortex and involves interaction of T cells with #thymic cortical epithelial cells# expressing self MHC #(choice D)#.  Positive selection is responsible for development of a T cell repertoire that can recognize self. $Negative selection occurs after positive selection and is the process by which T cells possessing TCRs that bind with high affinity to self antigen or self MHC class I or II are eliminated by apoptosis.  Negative selection occurs in the thymic medulla and involves interaction of the developing T cells with #thymic medullary epithelial and dendritic cells#.  This process serves to eliminate T cells that may be overly autoreactive against self antigens and therefore may play a role in autoimmunity if not destroyed.  This results in a population of T cells that have only an appropriately low affinity for self MHC molecules. $#(Choice A)#  Affinity maturation is the process of enhancing the hypervariable region antigen binding affinity that occurs after initial binding of antigen to membrane-bound immunoglobulin on a naïve B lymphocyte and subsequent migration of that B-lymphocyte to a lymph node.  Within the germinal center of the lymph node, affinity maturation is accomplished by the process of somatic hypermutation where the DNA coding for the immunoglobulin variable region is mutated randomly at a very high rate.  This process results in new immunoglobulins with similar, better, or worse affinity for the antigen; only B cells expressing antibody with enhanced affinity for antigen will be selected for.  This process does not occur in T-lymphocyte maturation. $#(Choice B)#  Isotype switching is a process that occurs in naïve B-lymphocytes upon initial exposure to antigen; this process does not occur in T-lymphocyte maturation. $#(Choice E)#  TCR DNA rearrangement is an exceedingly complex process that results in excess of 1015 different possible antigen binding sites.  The process is similar to that of immunoglobulin gene rearrangement in that it involves joining of V, D, J and C regions of the TCR gene and the processes of junctional flexibility, N and P-region nucleotide addition, alternative joining of genes, and multiple peptides combining to form the intact receptor.  The mature TCR is formed from joining of an a and a b protein segment, and these proteins are membrane-bound in close association with either CD4 or CD8 as well as the costimulatory CD28 and CD45. $#Educational objective# The process of negative selection in T cell maturation is essential for eliminating T cells that bind to self MHC or self antigens with overly high affinity.  This process occurs in the thymic medulla.  If these cells were permitted to survive, they would likely induce immune and inflammatory reactions against self antigens leading to autoimmune disease.

In contrast to bradykinin-mediated hereditary angioedema, allergic angioedema (eg, anaphylaxis) is due to histamine release from activated mast cells and presents with pruritis and urticaria in addition to swelling. $#(Choice C)#  C8 is involved in the formation of the membrane attack complex, which, when deficient, results in increased susceptibility to Neisseria infections.  Deficiency of terminal complement components (C5, C6, C7, C8, C9) does not occur with hereditary angioedema because the upstream complement fragments (C2b, C4b) are rapidly inactivated in the plasma. $#(Choice D)#  Selective IgA deficiency increases risk for anaphylaxis, which can cause angioedema.  However, this risk is only with transfusion of blood products and would present with other organ system involvement (eg, bronchospasm, hypotension, urticaria).  IgA deficiency is also associated with certain autoimmune conditions (eg, celiac disease, systemic lupus erythematosus), but none of these would present with isolated facial swelling. $#Educational objective# Hereditary angioedema is characterized by recurrent episodes of cutaneous and/or mucosal swelling due to C1 inhibitor deficiency.  C4 levels are low due to uninhibited cleavage of C4 by excess activated C1.  ",

  "explanation_2": "Although patients who undergo organ transplantation receive immunosuppressive therapy, rejection reactions still commonly occur.  The severity and timing of the rejection depends on the degree of difference between the donor and recipient major histocompatibility complex antigens in addition to other variables. $#Chronic lung transplant rejection# is marked by submucosal lymphocytic inflammation in the walls of the #small airways#.  Subsequent ingrowth of granulation tissue into the lumen leads to airway obstruction and obliteration (#bronchiolitis obliterans#).  Patients usually present with #slowly worsening dyspnea# and dry cough that begins #months or years after transplantation#.  Lung examination may reveal end-expiratory squeaks or pops, and spirometry typically demonstrates airflow limitation (obstructive pattern) with a drop in FEV1. $Other forms of lung transplant rejection include: $• Hyperacute rejection usually occurs on the first day of transplantation and is caused by preformed host antibodies against donor ABO or human leukocyte antigens (major histocompatibility complexes).  Histology generally shows fibrinoid necrosis with hemorrhage and ischemia (\"white graft\" reaction). $• Acute rejection normally occurs within 6 months of transplantation and is typically caused by a cell-mediated immune response to donor human leukocyte antigens.  Histology generally shows perivascular mononuclear infiltrates in the small blood vessels of the lung, which can expand to include the alveolar walls #(choices A and E)#. $#(Choice B)#  Bronchiolitis obliterans can occasionally cause large airway scarring, leading to bronchiectasis, but this is not the primary pathologic manifestation. $#(Choice C)#  Restrictive allograft syndrome, a less common type of chronic lung transplant rejection, can result in fibrotic changes to the pleurae.  However, pulmonary function tests would reveal a restrictive (reduced FVC), not obstructive, pattern. $#Educational objective# Chronic lung transplant rejection is due primarily to progressive scarring of the small airways, leading to bronchiolitis obliterans.

  "explanation_2": "This patient most likely experienced #vasovagal syncope#, which involves a pain-induced or an emotional distress–induced #cardioinhibitory and vasodepressor# response.  #Vaccine administration# is a known precipitant of vasovagal syncope, especially in adolescents.  Because syncope-related falls can lead to serious injury (eg, skull fractures, intracranial hemorrhage), patients should be closely monitored for 15 minutes following vaccine administration. $Patients with vasovagal syncope typically experience a #prodrome# (eg, pallor, nausea, diaphoresis) prior to losing consciousness.  The mechanism is not well understood, but the trigger, in combination with a state of orthostatic stress (eg, upright posture, dehydration), is believed to signal the CNS to decrease sympathetic activity and increase parasympathetic tone, overriding the @normal baroreceptor response@.  This leads to #bradycardia#, reduced LV contractility, and decreased peripheral vascular resistance, resulting in #hypotension#, decreased cerebral perfusion, and, ultimately, syncope.  Symptoms rapidly resolve within 1-2 minutes. $Postvaccination syncope can be confused with anaphylaxis, a rare but serious adverse effect resulting from IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to a vaccine component (eg, egg or yeast proteins).  Anaphylaxis can develop rapidly following vaccination and may cause hypotension and syncope; however, affected patients typically experience urticaria or flushing rather than pallor, respiratory symptoms (eg, upper airway edema, bronchospasm), and reflex tachycardia rather than bradycardia #(choice C)#. $#(Choice A)#  Delayed-type reactions are due to the direct action of sensitized T cells when stimulated by contact with an antigen.  They occur hours to days, rather than minutes, after exposure and typically present with a rash. $#(Choice B)#  An excessive cytokine response to the microbial components of a vaccine can result in a self-limiting local reaction (eg, redness or pain at the vaccination site) or, sometimes, systemic symptoms (eg, fever, malaise). $#(Choice E)#  The administration of a @live attenuated vaccine@ (eg, measles, mumps, and rubella) to an immunocompromised host may cause uncontrolled replication and systemic invasion of the virus.  Symptoms of an active infection would not manifest until >12-24 hours.  Neither the meningococcal nor the HPV vaccine is live, and this patient is not immunocompromised. $#Educational objective# Vasovagal syncope is a known complication of vaccine administration, particularly in adolescents.  It typically involves a prodrome and can be differentiated from anaphylaxis based on skin findings (pallor vs urticaria), absence of respiratory symptoms (eg, upper airway edema, bronchospasm), and presence of bradycardia (vs tachycardia).

Light chains have a variable and constant region; heavy chains have a variable region and 3 or 4 constant regions (CH1-4) depending on the immunoglobulin type. $Immunoglobulins are generally further divided into 2 functional pieces as follows: $• The #Fab fragment# is composed of the entire light-chain and the heavy-chain variable and first constant region.  This portion of the immunoglobulin uses the variable region of the light and heavy chain to #bind specific antigenic epitopes#.  IgM has 10 Fab fragments; other immunoglobulins have 2 $• The #Fc fragment# is composed of the remaining constant regions (eg, CH2-4) of the heavy chain.  The Fc fragment exerts the effector functions of the molecule, which may include activating the classical complement cascade (eg, CH2 on IgG) or binding the Fc receptor on phagocytic cells (eg, CH4 on IgM, CH3 on IgG) $IgG, IgA, and IgD also have a #hinge region# between the Fab and the Fc fragments.  The hinge region is rich in cysteine and proline amino acids, which provide #significant flexibility# to the immunoglobulin and allow greater movement of the Fab fragment arms.  Fab fragments with long hinge regions are better able to #reach multiple epitopes# on an antigen; this #increases immunoglobulin avidity# because @avidity@ is directly proportional to the number of Fab-antigen interactions.  However, long hinge regions are more susceptible to destruction by bacterial proteases (eg, IgA protease). $#(Choice A)#  Affinity is the binding strength of the Fab variable region for a given antigenic epitope.  Affinity is determined by the hypervariable amino acid sequence of the variable region; the hinge region does not play a role. $#(Choice B)#  IgM is a pentamer and IgA is usually dimeric.  These multimers form due to disulfide bonds between the Fc chains of the molecule and an additional amino acid sequence called the J chain.  Polymerization is not affected by the hinge region. $#(Choices D and E)#  The Fc portions of different immunoglobulins interact with different receptors on immune cells.  IgE interacts with the Fc epsilon receptor on mast cells, IgG interacts with the Fc gamma receptor on phagocytes and natural killer cells, and IgA interacts with the Fc alpha receptor on neutrophils, macrophages, and eosinophils.  The specificity of these interactions is mediated by the heavy-chain constant regions in the Fc portion of the immunoglobulins, not the hinge region. $#Educational objective# IgG, IgA, and IgD have a hinge region between the Fab fragment and the Fc fragment of the immunoglobulin.  The hinge region increases flexibility of the Fab arms, which makes the antibody more likely to bind to more than one site on the antigen.  This increases the avidity of the immunoglobulin but makes it more susceptible to destruction by bacterial proteases.  ",

  "explanation_2": "This patient's recurrent infections, failure to thrive, and defective signaling between CD4 cells and B cells indicate #hyper-IgM syndrome#, a genetic disorder most often caused by mutations in CD40 ligand (CD40L). $CD40L is expressed on the surface of #activated CD4 cells#.  It binds to CD40 on activated #B-cells#, which is required for B-cells to undergo @class-switch recombination@, allowing them to produce IgE, IgA, or IgG instead of IgM and IgD.  Cytokines released by nearby CD4 T cells determine which isotype is produced by promoting specific @splicing@ of the #heavy-chain constant region#.  The heavy-chain variable region, which binds antigenic epitopes, is unaffected. $Because patients with defects in CD40L are unable to generate significant immunoglobulins other than IgM, laboratory evaluation shows #elevated IgM# and absent or #low IgE, IgA, and IgG#.  Common manifestations of hyper-IgM syndrome include the following: $• #Sinopulmonary infections# (eg, pneumonia, otitis media) due to insufficient opsonizing IgG to help clear encapsulated bacteria (eg, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae) $• #Chronic diarrhea# (eg, Giardia lamblia) due to an absence of significant IgA at the mucosal border $• #Opportunistic infections# (eg, Pneumocystis, Cryptosporidium) due to impaired cell-mediated immunity from decreased antigen-presenting cell activity (CD40 is also expressed by antigen-presenting cells and helps to stimulate them) $• #Minimal lymphoid tissue# (eg, lymph nodes, tonsils) due to the impaired formation of germinal centers. $Recurrent infections often result in failure to thrive. $#(Choice B)#  All 3 complement pathways (alternative, classical, lectin) converge on @C3 convertase@, which splices C3 into the anaphylatoxin C3a and the opsonizing protein C3b.  Although the alternative and lectin pathways are unaffected by hyper-IgM syndrome, the classical pathway may be mildly impaired because it relies primarily on IgG to serve as a foundation for the C1 complex.  However, complement levels tend to be normal, particularly when no acute infection present. $#Educational objective# Hyper-IgM syndrome is usually caused by a defect in CD40 ligand, which prevents B cells from undergoing class-switch recombination.  Clinical features include recurrent sinopulmonary, gastrointestinal (eg, Giardia), and opportunistic infections.  Laboratory findings include elevated IgM and low or absent IgG, IgA, and IgE.  ",

  "explanation_2": "$Immunoglobulin is composed of a pair of light and heavy chains linked by disulfide bonds.  The light chain contains a variable region and a constant region; the heavy chain contains a variable region and 3 or 4 constant regions (CH1-4).  The functional structure of the immunoglobulin is broadly divided into the 2 following components: $• The #Fab fragment# is the entire light chain plus the variable and first constant (CH1) regions of the heavy chain; Fab fragments bind to specific #epitopes on antigens# using a hypervariable cluster of 110-130 amino acids in the variable portion of the molecule #(choices D and E)#. $• The #Fc fragment# is the remaining constant regions of the heavy chain; the Fc fragment is the #effector portion# of the immunoglobulin that #interacts with complement and immune cells#. $IgG, the most prevalent immunoglobulin in serum, is the immunoglobulin primarily responsible for controlling most #recurrent bacterial infections#.  It binds to bacterial epitopes with the Fab fragment and then exerts its bactericidal effects with the second and third #heavy chain constant regions# of the Fc fragment, as follows: $• #Complement activation:#  The second heavy-chain constant region serves as a platform for activation of the classical complement cascade.  This generates membrane attack complexes and @opsonizing C3b ligands@ for the CR1 receptor on erythrocytes and reticuloendothelial phagocytes. $• #Direct phagocytosis:#  The third heavy-chain constant region is the ligand for the #Fc receptor# (CD16) on the surface of #phagocytic cells#.  Binding results in phagocytosis of the immunoglobulin-covered bacteria and subsequent destruction. $#(Choice B)#  The constant region of the light chain is bound to the first constant region of the heavy chain with disulfide bonds.  It does not play a significant role in opsonization or phagocyte binding. $#(Choice C)#  Immunoglobulins have hinge regions between the Fab and Fc fragments that provide flexibility to the Fab arms.  Longer hinge regions are associated with increased antibody avidity because the Fab fragments can reach antigens that are farther apart on the bacteria.  The hinge region does not bind to the Fc receptor on phagocytes. $#Educational objective# Immunoglobulin contains a Fab fragment that binds to antigen and an Fc fragment that activates complement and/or interacts with immune cells.  The Fc fragment of IgG activates the classical complement cascade (constant heavy chain region 2) and serves as a ligand for the Fc receptor on phagocytes (constant heavy chain region 3).",

Nerve damage can lead to loss of sensation while damage to venules can result in fluid extravasation through gaps between injured venule endothelial cells.  The result is a blister formed from a collection of serous fluid between the dermis and epidermis #(choice A)#. $#(Choices C and E)#  Platelets and neutrophils play an important role in healing after a thermal burn by releasing prostaglandins, cytokines, and growth factors that stimulate increased blood flow, inflammation, and tissue regrowth.  Although both cells contribute to the erythema in and around a burn wound, these changes occur hours to days after the burn rather than minutes after, as in this patient. $#(Choice D)#  Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is released by platelets, macrophages, and endothelial cells and plays an important role in generating the vascular and fibroblast proliferation needed for normal wound healing over the days to weeks following the initial injury. $#Educational objective# The earliest morphologic change that occurs after a superficial thermal burn is erythema due to the release of preformed mediators (eg, histamine) from mast cells.

  "explanation_2": "T-lymphocytes, or thymocytes, are produced in the bone marrow and undergo maturation in the thymus during the first trimester of gestation.  In the thymus the processes of T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement, positive selection, negative selection and expression of extracellular membrane markers and co-stimulatory molecules occur.  Pro-T cells arrive at the thymus as \"double negative\" cells - cells that lack both CD4 and CD8 antigens.  Next, the process of TCR gene rearrangement begins first with rearrangement of the b chain genes.  Synthesis of a productive rearrangement of the b chain of the TCR leads to stimulation of production of BOTH CD4 and CD8 antigens with simultaneous expression of BOTH CD4 and CD8.  These cells are referred to as \"double positive\" T cells or immature T-lymphocytes #(choice A)#.  Subsequently, the process of rearrangement of the a chain of the TCR occurs followed by positive selection in the thymic cortex and negative selection in the thymic medulla.  Once these processes are complete, the final step in maturation of the T-lymphocytes is loss of either the CD4 or the CD8 antigen so that the mature thymocytes only express one or the other of these antigens. $#(Choice B)#  Mature cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are also referred to as CD8+ T-lymphocytes; these cells do not express the CD4 antigen on their surfaces.  These cells recognize and kill altered self cells by recognizing foreign antigen presented by these cells on MHC Class I molecules on the cell surface. $#(Choice C)#  Mature helper T lymphocytes are also referred to as CD4+ T-lymphocytes; these cells do not express the CD8 antigen on their surfaces. $#(Choice D)#  Antigen presenting cells include dendritic cells, macrophages and B-lymphocytes.  Dendritic cells are professional antigen presenting cells.  They take up antigen by endocytosis, constitutively express MHC Class II and the co-stimulatory B7 molecule, and are able to activate all forms of T cells (naïve, effector and memory).  Macrophages are phagocytes that only inducably express MHC II and B7 and can only activate effector and memory T cells, not naive T cells.  B-lymphocytes take up antigen by receptor-mediated (membrane-bound antibody) endocytosis and constitutively express MHC II.  These cells are able to stimulate all forms of T-lymphocytes. $#(Choice E)#  Natural killer (NK) cells are part of the innate immune system and function in a fashion very similar to CD8+ CTLs though they express neither CD8 nor CD4 on their cell surfaces. $#(Choice F)#  Thymic epithelial cells play a role in positive selection of immature thymocytes in the thymic cortex.  These cells express MHC antigens on their cell surfaces that interact with the TCR on the immature thymocytes.  Thymocytes able to bind MHC receive a protective signal and do not undergo apoptosis, while thymocytes unable to bind MHC will be killed.  This is how self-MHC restriction is generated in the T-lymphocyte population. $#Educational objective# Immature T-lymphocytes express both the CD4 and CD8 cell surface antigens in addition to a complete TCR or a pro-TCR.  These lymphocytes exist in the thymic cortex where they undergo positive selection and in the thymic medulla where they undergo negative selection."

In this case, the #absent CD40 ligand# (CD40L) on flow cytometry is diagnostic for #hyper-IgM syndrome#. $CD40L is normally present on activated CD4+ T cells and interacts primarily with CD40 on B cells in the secondary germinal centers of lymphoid tissues.  This T-cell–dependent interaction is required to form B-cell @germinal centers@; without it, patients with hyper-IgM syndrome #lack secondary germinal centers# and often have small/#nonpalpable lymph nodes#. $Because the interaction of @CD40L@ with CD40 allows for @B-cell activation@ and differentiation into immunoglobulin-producing plasma cells and memory B cells, lack of CD40L causes B cells to remain in their native IgM-producing state.  Without opsonizing IgG antibody, patients with hyper-IgM syndrome are predisposed to recurrent #sinopulmonary# infections (eg, pneumonia, sinusitis) caused by encapsulated bacteria.  In addition, lack of mucosal IgA increases the risk for #gastrointestinal infections# (eg, Giardia).  #Failure to thrive# is also common because of increased metabolic demands from recurrent infections, as well as nutrient loss from chronic diarrhea. $#(Choice A)#  Absent thymic tissue, which can be seen in DiGeorge syndrome, results in absent T-cell production.

Neonates are protected with maternal anti-Hib IgG antibodies from placental transfer in utero, but this protection wanes as the immunoglobulins are degraded during the first few months of life.  Therefore, widespread vaccination with the Hib @polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccine@ series is recommended starting at age 2 months; this practice has dramatically reduced the incidence of Hib infection. $Bacteria with polysaccharide capsules (eg, Hib, Streptococcus pneumoniae [pneumococcus], Neisseria meningitidis) are antiphagocytic.  The #polysaccharide capsule# provokes an #antibody-mediated (B cell) immune response# and is the primary antigenic constituent of vaccines against encapsulated bacteria.  However, vaccines containing the polysaccharide antigen alone are ineffective in children age <2 years due to their immature humoral immunity.  Therefore, the polysaccharide is #conjugated# with a #carrier protein# to amplify the patient's humoral response against the polysaccharide through T cell recruitment.  The Hib conjugate vaccine contains a carrier protein that is derived from either a tetanus toxoid (TT) protein or an outer membrane protein (OMP) of Neisseria meningitidis.  The polysaccharide-protein conjugate then becomes a T cell-dependent antigen.  #Immunogenicity is increased# as a result of #T cell-dependent stimulation of B lymphocytes# and the #production of memory B lymphocytes#. $#(Choice A)#  Conjugation does not affect vaccine safety.  The main adverse effects of the Hib vaccine include fever, irritability, and injection site reactions (eg, pain, redness, swelling). $#(Choice C)#  Although conjugation allows for a more robust immune response, a 2- or 3-dose primary series in infancy followed by a booster dose is still required to achieve protective Hib antibody levels. $#(Choice D)#  Nontypeable H influenzae represents nonencapsulated strains that generally cause local disease (eg, sinusitis, otitis media).  These bacteria colonize the nasopharynx of most individuals age >5 years.  The Hib vaccine does not confer protection against nontypeable H influenzae. $#(Choice E)#  Conjugated OMP and TT protein do not elicit protective antibody levels.  Therefore, a patient is not considered to be immunized against the pathogen that the carrier protein is derived from. $#Educational objective# The Haemophilus influenzae serotype b vaccine consists of a capsular polysaccharide conjugated to a carrier protein (tetanus toxoid [TT] protein or outer membrane protein [OMP] of Neisseria meningitidis).

Once activated, calcineurin dephosphorylates nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), which allows NFAT to enter the nucleus and bind to an interleukin-2 (IL-2) promoter.  IL-2 stimulates the growth and differentiation of T cells and is an important component of the immune response.  #Cyclosporine# and #tacrolimus#, 2 of the more commonly used immunosuppressants in transplant patients, #inhibit# calcineurin activation. $#(Choice A)#  Bcl-2 is an apoptosis inhibitor.  When Bcl-2 is overexpressed, cell death is delayed and an accumulation of indolent malignant cells occurs.  Bcl-2 involvement has been implicated in follicular cell lymphomas, most of which have a characteristic t(14;18) translocation.  Bcl-2 inhibition would not be specific to T cells. $#(Choice C)#  E-cadherin is a transmembrane glycoprotein that orchestrates epithelial cell adhesion.  If this glycoprotein is lost, cell clusters may be disrupted.  The loss of e-cadherin is associated with metastasis and is a predictor of disease progression in some cancers. $#(Choice D)#  Neurofibromin is a tumor suppressor protein encoded by the NF1 gene on chromosome 17.  Neurofibromin can protect against cancer as it is a key suppressor of Ras, one of the more powerful activators of cell growth and proliferation. $#(Choice E)#  p53 is a tumor suppressor that causes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.  It is rendered ineffective in the majority of cancers. $#Educational objective# Calcineurin is an essential protein in the activation of interleukin-2, which promotes the growth and differentiation of T cells.  Immunosuppressants such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus work by inhibiting calcineurin activation.  "

  "explanation_2": "$Apoptosis can be triggered by a number of mechanisms, including deprivation of growth factors, DNA damage, intracellular accumulation of misfolded proteins, mediation by cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and activation of receptors in the TNF receptor family (such as Fas).  Fas receptors initiate the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis through a cytoplasmic component known as the death domain.  Upon binding Fas ligand (FasL), the receptors trimerize, allowing their death domains to form a binding site for an adapter protein called Fas-associated death domain (FADD).  Receptor-bound FADD then stimulates the activation of initiator caspases (8 & 10) that begin an activation cascade culminating in the activation of executioner caspases (3 & 6).  These initiate the terminal processes of apoptosis, including cleavage of DNA, fragmentation of the nucleus, organelle autodigestion, and plasma membrane blebbing. $The Fas receptor is expressed on T-lymphocytes and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases, including cancer and autoimmune disorders.  Once activated, T lymphocytes begin to express FasL, which can bind to Fas on the same cell or adjacent lymphocytes.  During initial clonal expansion, activated T lymphocytes are resistant to Fas-induced apoptosis.  However, they become more sensitive with progressive stimulation.  In the constant presence of stimulating self-antigens, activated T lymphocytes eventually undergo apoptosis in a process known as activation-induced cell death.  Mutations involving Fas or FasL impair this process, resulting in excessive accumulation of autoreactive T-cells and the development of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (which this patient appears to have). $#(Choice B)#  As B lymphocytes undergo affinity maturation, cells that exhibit a stronger affinity for the antigen (which acts as a limited growth resource) are able to proliferate more than cells with lower affinity.  This results in cells that are more efficient and accurate in binding to pathogens.  Affinity maturation does not involve the Fas pathway. $#(Choice C)#  Anergy is a state of prolonged unresponsiveness that occurs in T lymphocytes as a form of immune tolerance.  It occurs when self-reactive T cells bind MHC molecules without receiving the necessary costimulatory signal (ie, binding of CD28 on T cells with the B7 on antigen-presenting cells). $#(Choice D)#  Isotype switching is the process through which activated B lymphocytes switch production from IgM immunoglobulins to IgG and IgA isotypes.  This process requires the interaction of CD40 on activated B cells with CD40 ligand expressed by activated T cells and is modulated by cytokines secreted by T cells. $#(Choice E)#  On exposure to an antigen, naïve T helper (TH0) cells differentiate into TH1 (cell-mediating) and TH2 (antibody-mediating) subtypes based on the local cytokine milieu.  IFN-γ and IL-12 induce TH1 formation; IL-4 stimulates TH2 development. $#Educational objective# The Fas receptor acts to initiate the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis.  Mutations involving the Fas receptor or Fas ligand can prevent apoptosis of autoreactive lymphocytes, thereby increasing the risk of autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus.  "

These proteins are processed by antigen presenting cells, displayed on class II major histocompatibility complexes, and the nonhuman components are #recognized as foreign# by patrolling CD4 cells.  The CD4 cells then stimulate activated B-cells to undergo somatic hypermutation and class switching, which generates plasma cells that secrete high-affinity #IgG antibodies against foreign components# of the drug. $With subsequent infusions, the foreign proteins in the medication trigger memory B cells to differentiate into plasma cells, which generate a burst of IgG against the monoclonal antibody.  Binding of the IgG to the medication generates #immune complexes# (ICs), which are then #cleared by mononuclear phagocytes# in the reticuloendothelial system, as follows: $• #Classic complement activation:#  The Fc portion of the bound IgG activates the @classical complement system@, leading to the generation of C3b on the IC.  C3b binds to CR1 on erythrocytes/leukocytes, which bring the IC to reticuloendothelial mononuclear phagocytes (eg, Kupffer cells, splenic macrophages) for clearance. $• #Direct removal:#  Mononuclear phagocytes bind to the Fc portion of the bound IgG using their Fc receptor (CD16) and remove the IC from the circulation. $IC clearance generally proceeds without issue, but significant quantities of ICs can saturate the phagocytic system and lead to IC aggregation; IC aggregates can deposit in tissue (eg, skin, joints), where persistent complement activation can result in a @type III hypersensitivity@ reaction called #serum sickness#.  This is typically marked by fever, urticarial rash, and joint pain #5-14 days# after exposure.  Most cases #resolve spontaneously# over days as mononuclear phagocytes continue to remove the excess ICs. $#(Choice B)#  Glucocorticoids trigger apoptotic cell death of eosinophils and tissue mast cells in patients with allergic conditions (eg, asthma).  Apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death, is not typically associated with degranulation or allergic symptoms. $#(Choices C and D)#  Antibodies are too large to be cleared from the bloodstream through fenestrations in the liver or kidney.  Instead, they are typically removed via endocytosis or phagocytosis after binding Fc receptors on the surface of immune cells (eg, macrophages, eosinophils, mast cells).  Endocytosis and degradation of mast cell-bound IgE occurs with type I hypersensitivity reactions (which occur within minutes, not days later); in addition, this process is only responsible for removing tiny amounts of IgE (not ICs) from the body. $#(Choice E)#  Regulatory T cells downregulate the cytotoxic T-cell response.  Although cytotoxic T cells mediate Stevens-Johnson syndrome (destruction of keratinocytes that are displaying drug antigens), they do not play a role in the development of serum sickness. $#Educational objective# Serum sickness is an immune complex–mediated type III hypersensitivity reaction that typically forms 5-14 days after exposure to foreign proteins in an antitoxin, antivenom, monoclonal antibody, or vaccine.

The presence of a large number of intact bacteria inside the neutrophils suggests #chronic granulomatous disease# (CGD), an X-linked recessive immunodeficiency marked by #impaired NADPH oxidase# activity. $NADPH oxidase resides on the plasma membrane of neutrophils and is incorporated into the membrane of the phagolysosome during phagocytosis; it catalyzes the formation of #superoxide free radicals#, which subsequently destroy engulfed pathogens (eg, fungi, bacteria) as part of the @oxidative burst@.  Because patients with CGD have impaired NADPH oxidase activity, they are not able to efficiently destroy bacteria and fungi following @phagocytosis@; therefore, microscopy will often reveal #intact microbes# in the neutrophil phagolysosome during active infection. $Patients with CGD are most susceptible to #catalase-positive organisms#, particularly Staphylococcus aureus, Burkholderia, Serratia, Nocardia, and Aspergillus.  Catalase degrades hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen, which reduces oxidative damage and protease activation by reactive oxygen species.  Although most pathogenic bacteria and fungi produce catalase, catalase-positive organisms pose a particular risk to patients with CGD because they require higher levels of free radicals (ie, greater NADPH oxidase function) for effective killing. $#(Choice B)#  S aureus produces coagulase, which binds to prothrombin and increases conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin.  Fibrin subsequently coats the exterior of the organism, which helps it evade phagocytosis.  Although patients with CGD are at elevated risk for S aureus, most of the other common pathogens in CGD do not produce coagulase. $#(Choice C)#  Lecithinase (alpha toxin) is the major virulence factor of Clostridium perfringens; it causes hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids, activating inflammatory pathways that increase platelet and leukocyte aggregation in the adjacent microvasculature, leading to vasoocclusion and ischemic necrosis. $#(Choice D)#  Lipopolysaccharide, a major virulence factor in the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, is not present in the gram-positive bacteria (eg, S aureus, Nocardia) and fungal organisms (eg, Aspergillus) that usually infect patients with CGD. $#(Choice E)#  The polysaccharide capsule is a major virulence factor for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and certain strains of Haemophilus influenzae.  Its primary role is to inhibit opsonophagocytosis.  Many of the common pathogens in CGD (eg, Nocardia, Aspergillus) do not contain a polysaccharide capsule. $#Educational objective# Chronic granulomatous disease is a primary immunodeficiency due to impaired NADPH oxidase, an enzyme that generates reactive oxygen species in phagolysosomes.

  "explanation_2": "This patient has a severe respiratory infection with #Aspergillus fumigatus#, an opportunistic, catalase-positive fungus usually seen in immunocompromised individuals.  He also has a history of recurrent infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus, another #catalase-positive organism#, as well as #normal immunoglobulin levels# and an appropriately elevated leukocyte count in response to infection (ie, #no leukopenia#).  These findings are suggestive of #chronic granulomatous disease# (CGD). $CGD is most commonly due to an X-linked recessive mutation affecting @NADPH oxidase@.  This enzyme is the first step in the respiratory burst pathway, initiating the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS).  In addition to directly damaging phagocytized pathogens, ROS also activate granule proteases that aid in the @destruction of organisms@ within the phagolysosome. $Without NADPH oxidase, patients with CGD have #impaired respiratory burst#.  Although protease degranulation occurs normally #(Choice A)#, these enzymes are not activated due to the absence of ROS, resulting in #defective phagocytic intracellular killing#.  Catalase-positive bacteria and fungi are most pathogenic in CGD because they can degrade their own metabolically produced hydrogen peroxide (ie, ROS), further limiting microbicidal protease activation.  Patients commonly develop S aureus abscesses (eg, lymphadenitis) and severe lung infections, as seen in this patient. $#(Choices B and E)#  Disrupted phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils refers to the impaired engulfing of organisms, which can occur when opsonization is absent due to antibody or complement deficiency.  In contrast, this patient's serum immunoglobulin levels are normal. $#(Choice C)#  Dysfunctional neutrophil trafficking is seen in leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) and causes impaired @leukocyte migration@.  Patients have recurrent mucosal infections and skin abscesses without pus, often due to S aureus, but recurrent lymphadenitis and Aspergillus infection would not be expected.  Moreover, marked leukocytosis (often >50,000/mm3) is typical with LAD because leukocytes cannot migrate out of blood vessels. $#Educational objective# Chronic granulomatous disease should be suspected in a child with recurrent infections by catalase-positive organisms (eg, Staphylococcus aureus, Aspergillus) who has normal immunoglobulins and no leukopenia.  Pathogenesis involves the defective intracellular killing of phagocytized organisms within neutrophils due to an impaired respiratory burst.",

  "explanation_2": "$Interactions between multiple receptors and ligands are generally required to activate effector cells of the adaptive immune response.  This redundancy slows immune cell activation and prevents development of autoimmunity.  #CD40 ligand# (CD40L), a transmembrane protein on the surface of #activated CD4 T cells#, is the most important #costimulatory# signal for #antigen-presenting cells# (APCs) as follows: $• #B Cells#:  Binding of CD40L to CD40 on B cells promotes the formation of germinal centers, somatic hypermutation (increased antigen-binding specificity), and @immunoglobulin class switching@ (secretion of IgG/IgA/IgE instead of IgM).  These actions significantly enhance the humoral immune response by generating the full range of effector immunoglobulins. $• #Macrophages# and #dendritic cells#:  Binding of CD40L to CD40 causes the APC to produce proinflammatory cytokines, express T-cell costimulatory signals (eg, CD80/86), increase phagocytosis, and increase major histocompatibility complex class II surface expression.  These changes promote the activation of additional CD4 T lymphocytes, which are critical for mounting a potent cell-mediated immune response. $Because CD40L is required for B-cells to undergo class-switching, mutations to CD40L generally cause B cells to overproduce IgM and dramatically underproduce other immunoglobulin classes (IgA, IgE, IgG).  Patients with this disorder #(hyper-IgM syndrome)# generally have significant deficits in both cell-mediated (eg, prevention of Pneumocystis pneumonia) and humoral (eg, opsonization and destruction of encapsulated bacteria) immunity. $#(Choice A)#  Certain complement components can reduce the amount of antigen necessary for B-cell activation by binding CD19 or CD21 on the B-cell surface.  This contributes to T-cell–independent B-cell activation and does not involve CD40L. $#(Choice B)#  Antigen-specific B-cell receptors bind to foreign antigens, the first step in B-cell activation.  CD40L plays a role in costimulation of the B cell by binding to CD40; it does not significantly alter B-cell antigen-receptor binding. $#(Choice C)#  CD18 on neutrophils binds to intercellular adhesion molecule-1 on vascular endothelial cells, allowing the neutrophils to migrate into tissue from the bloodstream.  Leukocyte adhesion deficits are usually triggered by mutations to CD18 and marked by recurrent infection.  They do not involve CD40L. $#(Choice D)#  The Fc receptor (CD16) on phagocytes binds to IgG attached to microorganisms or cellular debris, leading to opsonophagocytosis.  Although IgG levels are very low in hyper-IgM syndrome, which significantly reduces IgG-mediated phagocytosis, the interaction between the phagocyte Fc receptor and antigen-bound antibody remains unaffected. $#Educational objective# CD40-ligand (CD40L) is expressed primarily on activated T cells.  It binds to CD40 on antigen-presenting cells, including B cells, leading to their full activation (costimulation).  Therefore, CD40L plays a vital role in both the cell-mediated and humoral immune response.  ",

  "explanation_2": "Inflammation is an important process in the defense against various pathogens.  It is characterized by the passage of leukocytes into the inflamed tissue.  The following steps are involved in @inflammatory leukocyte accumulation@: $ 1. Margination:  Increased vascular leakage in the microvasculature leads to hemoconcentration and decreased wall shear stress, improving the contact of neutrophils with the endothelial lining #(choice B)#.  $2. Rolling:  Neutrophils roll on the endothelium via the loose binding of sialylated carbohydrate groups, such as Sialyl Lewis X or PSGL-1, to #L-selectin# on neutrophils or #E-selectin/P-selectin# on endothelial cells #(choice C)#.  Cytokine stimulation greatly increases expression of endothelial selectins.  $3. Activation:  Slow rolling allows the leukocytes to sample the chemokines secreted by the inflamed tissue.  This activates integrins by inducing a signaling cascade that results in a conformational change in the integrins necessary for binding.  $4. Tight adhesion and crawling:  Neutrophils become firmly attached to the endothelium via the binding of #CD 18 beta 2 integrins# (#Mac-1# and #LFA-1#) to #intercellular adhesion molecule-1# (#ICAM-1#) on endothelial cells (#choices A and D)#.  $5. Transmigration:  After crawling to the endothelial cell periphery, neutrophils eventually migrate out of the vasculature by squeezing in between the cells via integrin attachments and adherence to #platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1# (#PECAM-1#).  This protein is found primarily at the peripheral intercellular junctions of endothelial cells. $Three leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) syndromes have been identified whereby leukocytes cannot leave the vasculature to migrate into tissues under conditions of inflammation.  All are rare, autosomal recessive disorders. $LAD type 1 results from the absence of CD18.  This leads to the inability to synthesize the beta-2 integrins Mac-1 and LFA1, affecting tight adhesion, crawling, and transmigration.  The clinical manifestations include recurrent skin infections #without pus formation#, #delayed detachment of the umbilical cord#, and poor wound healing.  LAD type 2 is a milder condition, with no delay in the separation of the umbilical cord and less severe and fewer infections.  LAD type 3 is similar to type 1 and causes severe, recurrent bacterial infections, delayed separation of the umbilical cord, and bleeding complications (due to affected beta-3 integrins on platelets). $#Educational objective# Inflammation is characterized by the passage of circulating inflammatory leukocytes into the inflamed tissue.  The steps involved include margination, rolling, activation, tight adhesion and crawling, and transmigration.  ",

Expression of these receptors does not depend on lysosomal acidification and would not directly affect T cell binding to antigen presenting cells. $#(Choice B)#  Integrins are necessary for the binding of inflammatory cells to vascular walls during the process of transmigration through the endothelial layer from the bloodstream to tissues. $#(Choice C)#  Most nucleated cells of the human body express MHC Class I molecules on their surfaces.  MHC Class I molecules present intracellular antigens produced in tumor or virus-infected cells.  Cytoplasmic proteins are degraded by a proteasome and transported into the rough endoplasmic reticulum (via TAP proteins) where they are loaded onto MHC Class I molecules and routed to the cell surface.

Although the TCR is essential for T cell activation in response to antigens presented on MHC Class II molecules, prevention of lysosome acidification would have no effect on the expression of TCR on the surface of T cells. $#Educational objective# MHC class II is expressed on the surface of antigen presenting cells (APC) and presents extracellular antigens to T cells after extracellular protein is degraded within acidified lysosomes.

However, the presence of microbes or damaged cells amplifies the production of C3b, which then engages with #factor B# and factor D and generates C3 convertase. $C3 convertase catalyzes the formation of proteins that opsonize pathogens, promote inflammation, and lead to the generation of membrane attack complexes. $The most common cause of complement deficiency is #autoantibodies#, which activate the classical complement system after binding host antigens.

These findings are consistent with the early and late phases of a @type I hypersensitivity@ reaction. $After first exposure to an allergen (eg, peanuts), antigen specific IgE is produced by B-cells and binds to the surface of mast cells.  If repeat exposure occurs, the bound IgE can cross-link and stimulate the release of preformed histamine and leukotrienes that cause vasodilation and increased capillary permeability.  The result is a rapid (eg, minutes after exposure) #early-phase# type I hypersensitivity response characterized by superficial dermal edema and erythema (eg, @wheal and flare reaction@) that can progress to a more systemic response (eg, anaphylaxis) #(choice D)#. $IgE also initiates the #late phase# of a type I hypersensitivity reaction by stimulating type 2 helper T cells to release cytokines (eg, IL-5) that activate #eosinophils#.  Cationic proteins (eg, #major basic protein#, eosinophil peroxidase) released from eosinophils cause #tissue damage#, which usually manifests as a palpable, #indurated lesion# 2-10 hours following the early-phase reaction. $#(Choice A)#  Binding of preformed IgG antibodies to cell surface antigens initiates cell lysis mediated by complement and/or natural killer cells (@type II hypersensitivity@ reactions).  These reactions can develop hours to days after exposure to an antigen (eg, medications, transfused red blood cells), resulting in destruction of erythrocytes (causing fatigue, pallor), platelets (petechial bleeding), or leukocytes (fever, sepsis). $#(Choice B)#  Immune complex-mediated complement activation typically causes tissue damage in sites where immune complexes tend to deposit (eg, skin, joints, kidneys) days to weeks after initial antigen exposure in @type III hypersensitivity@ reactions.  Although an Arthus reaction can cause local swelling within hours of an exposure, it is usually associated with intradermal injection of a vaccine. $#(Choice E)#  In @type IV (delayed) hypersensitivity@ reactions, CD4+ T cells release cytokines (eg, interferon gamma) that promote T cell- and macrophage-mediated tissue damage.  Although these reactions can also present as an indurated skin lesion (eg, tuberculosis skin testing), type IV hypersensitivity reactions develop over days (rather than hours) because of the time needed for cellular amplification. $#Educational objective# The late phase of dermatologic type I hypersensitivity reactions manifests as an indurated skin lesion hours after exposure to the allergen due to local tissue damage caused by major basic protein released from eosinophils.  In contrast, type IV hypersensitivity reactions develop over days because of the time needed to produce a cell-mediated immune response. ",

Molecular and immunologic advances have led to a dramatic expansion in treatments for chronic systemic inflammatory diseases such as GPA; treatments are generally classified as follows: $• #Cytokine inhibitors:#  These bind free inflammatory cytokines or block cytokine receptors on cell surfaces; they target tumor necrosis factor (eg, infliximab, etanercept), IL-1, IL-6, IL-17, or IL-12/23 #(choice E)#. $• #T-cell costimulation inhibitors:#  Two steps are required to activate cytotoxic T cells.  The T cell must bind a specific antigen on the major histocompatibility complex type 1 of an antigen-presenting cell, and then the T cell must be costimulated by the interaction between the T-cell surface receptor CD28 and the antigen-presenting cell surface ligand CD80/86.  T-cell costimulatory inhibitors (eg, abatacept) block the CD28 receptor on the cytotoxic T cell, which prevents T-cell costimulation and causes T-cell anergy #(choice A)#. $• #B-cell depletion or inhibition:#  Because B cells generate inflammatory cytokines, promote T-cell activation, and differentiate into plasma cells that generate autoantibodies, medications that inhibit B-cell activation (eg, belimumab) or deplete B-cell populations (eg, #rituximab#) are highly effective in many systemic inflammatory disorders. $Rituximab is an #IgG monoclonal antibody against CD20#, a surface molecule present on developing and mature #B cells#.  Binding of rituximab to CD20 results in Fc receptor–mediated B-cell cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent B-cell phagocytosis, which #significantly reduces the B-cell population#.  Although existing plasma cells are unaffected (they do not express CD20), the reduction in total B-cell population significantly improves inflammatory symptoms.  However, depletion of B cells also increases the risk for severe and recurrent bacterial infections, a major adverse effect of therapy. $#(Choice C)#  Natalizumab is a monoclonal antibody against integrin, an adhesion molecule that mediates leukocyte interaction with the endothelium and subsequent leukocyte attachment/migration into tissue.  Natalizumab is used in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. $#(Choice D)#  Cytoplasmic kinases (eg, Janus kinase) transmit inflammatory cytokine receptor binding to the nucleus.  Rituximab does not operate via this mechanism, but new therapies that target these intracellular signaling pathways are under development. $#Educational objective# Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody directed against CD20, a cell surface receptor on developing and mature B cells.  Binding of rituximab to CD20 results in B-cell cytotoxicity and phagocytosis, which reduces the B-cell population.  This reduces inflammatory symptoms in a wide range of rheumatologic diseases. "

  "explanation_2": "This young woman's rapid-onset high fever, confusion, neck stiffness, and petechial rash likely indicate bacterial meningitis due to #Neisseria meningitidis# infection.  Although healthy, college-aged individuals are at high risk for a single episode of bacterial meningitis, this patient's recurrent pneumonia and previous meningitis suggest an underlying #immune system impairment#.  Culture results from her previous infections are unknown, but the leading cause of pneumonia and meningitis is #Streptococcus pneumoniae#. $The major virulence factor for both N meningitidis and S pneumoniae is a #polysaccharide capsule#, which allows the bacteria to evade the following host defenses: $• #Phagocytosis:#  Capsules have a negative charge, which repels the negative charge of the phagocyte surface.  Capsules are also hydrophilic, which reduces surface tension at the interface between the capsule and the phagocyte, making engulfment more difficult. $• #Opsonization:#  Capsules cover underlying antigenic epitopes on the bacterial cell membrane, which limits immunoglobulin binding.  This impairs immunoglobulin-mediated opsonization and classical complement pathway activation. $Therefore, initial control of encapsulated bacterial infections is largely dependent on the @alternative complement cascade@, which is triggered when autoactivated C3 lands on the bacterial cell and undergoes amplification.  The alternative pathway generates the opsonin C3b (which increases bacterial phagocytosis), but it primarily kills encapsulated bacteria via the creation of #membrane attack complexes# (MACs).  MACs form pores in the bacterial surface, leading to membrane destabilization and osmotic lysis.  Therefore, patients who have defects in the complement proteins that generate the MAC (C5-C9) are at risk for #recurrent, life-threatening infections# from encapsulated bacteria. $#(Choice A)#  DiGeorge syndrome causes T-cell lymphopenia due to congenital absence of the thymus and parathyroid glands.  Absent T-cells cause recurrent viral and fungal infections, not recurrent bacteremia. $#(Choice B)#  Excessive IgE production is seen in hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome.  Although recurrent sinopulmonary infection is common, patients also have severe eczema and recurrent abscesses. $#(Choice C)#  Impaired @neutrophil chemotaxis@ is seen in leukocyte adhesion defects, which prevent neutrophil extravasation and migration to areas of infection.  Although recurrent bacterial infection is common, patients often have a variety of other findings (eg, absence of pus, delayed umbilical cord separation, impaired wound healing). $#(Choice E)#  Chronic granulomatous disease is an X-linked immunodeficiency due to impaired @NADPH oxidase@, which prevents neutrophils from generating an oxidative burst.  Although recurrent pneumonia is common, meningitis is not.  In addition, infections associated with this defect are caused by certain catalase-positive organisms (eg, staphylococci), not encapsulated bacteria (eg, N meningitidis). $#Educational objective# Deficiency of the complement factors that form the membrane attack complex (C5-C9) results in recurrent infections of the lung and meninges by encapsulated bacteria (eg, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis).

Because the antivenom contains #foreign proteins#, exposure triggers the #adaptive immune response# to form high-affinity IgG antibodies against the foreign components of the antivenom.  This typically takes #1-2 weeks# due to time lag between antigen processing, antigen presentation, CD4 T-lymphocyte activation, and T-cell–mediated B-cell activation/differentiation. $Once formed, IgG then binds to the free-circulating antivenom, which creates #immune complexes# (ICs).  The Fc portion of the IgG triggers clearance of the ICs by activating the classical complement system and by directly binding to the Fc receptor on mononuclear phagocytes in the reticuloendothelial system.

On first exposure to a new antigen, naïve #B cells# become @activated@ and undergo clonal expansion.  Some differentiate into short-lived plasma cells that release antigen-specific IgM through a T-cell–independent process.  However, most activated B cells migrate to lymphoid follicles located in the @lymph node cortex@ where they form #germinal centers#, the major sites of B-cell proliferation and affinity maturation during the immune response.  Ultimately, some of these B cells become long-lived memory cells that remain dormant until the next encounter with the same antigen, but the majority transform into long-lived, antibody-secreting plasma cells. $#Isotype switching# (ie, @immunoglobulin class switching@) occurs in the germinal centers late in the primary response and allows B cells to produce antibodies of isotypes other than IgM.  The immunoglobulin heavy-chain constant regions are isotype specific and distinguish the 5 isotypes (ie, IgM, IgG, IgA, IgE, IgD), whereas the variable regions are antigen specific; light chains are antigen specific and do not determine isotype. $Isotype switching requires interaction of the CD40 receptor on activated B cells with the CD40 ligand on activated helper T cells (#costimulation#).  The subsequent genetic rearrangement of the heavy-chain constant regions is #modulated by T-cell cytokines# (eg, interferon-gamma, IL-4, IL-5).  After the primary IgM immune response, later encounters with the same antigen typically generate a predominantly IgG response (or IgA for mucosal pathogens). $#(Choices A and C)#  Self-tolerance (ie, immunologic unresponsiveness to self-antigens) develops via 2 mechanisms: central and peripheral.  Central tolerance, acquired during lymphocyte maturation, occurs in the primary lymphoid organs (eg, bone marrow [B cells], thymus [T cells]).  During this process, immature lymphocytes go through negative selection, in which cells that strongly recognize self-antigens undergo apoptosis (ie, deletion). $#(Choices D and E)#  Recombination of the V, D, and J regions of immunoglobulin heavy chains and the V and J regions of light chains occurs via DNA rearrangement during B-cell maturation within the bone marrow.  Although an enormous variety of immunoglobulins can be produced through recombination, after undergoing this process, each B cell makes antibodies of a single specificity. $#Educational objective# The primary immune response to a new antigen initially results in plasma cells that produce only IgM.  Isotype switching occurs later in germinal centers and gives B cells the ability to produce antibodies of differing isotypes (eg, IgG, IgA). ",

However, they also typically have oculocutaneous albinism, peripheral neuropathy, and @giant cytoplasmic granules@ on peripheral blood smear. $#(Choice D)#  DiGeorge syndrome results from maldevelopment of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches, which causes hypoplasia of the parathyroid glands and thymus (T cell deficiency), cardiac and aortic arch abnormalities, and characteristic facies due to maldevelopment of the mandible. $#(Choice E)#  Hemolytic uremic syndrome most often occurs in children after infection with Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli.  Patients typically have thrombocytopenia with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and acute renal failure. $#Educational objective# Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is characterized by the triad of eczema, thrombocytopenia, and combined B and T cell deficiency.

Following contact with these plants, patients develop a #highly pruritic#, erythematous rash consisting of papules, vesicles, and bullae that may show signs of excoriation.  The rash most frequently affects exposed skin (eg, legs, forearms) and often forms #linear streaks# as the patient walks past the plant, dragging it along the skin. $Contact dermatitis is a type IV (#delayed-type#) hypersensitivity reaction that occurs in 2 distinct phases:  $1. The #sensitization phase# leads to the creation of hapten-specific T cells and takes 10-14 days.  Cutaneous dendritic cells take up the haptens and express them on MHC-I and MHC-II molecules as hapten-conjugated peptides.  These dendritic cells travel to the draining lymph nodes and interact with hapten-sensitive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, causing activation and clonal expansion.  $2. The #elicitation phase# occurs within 2-3 days following re-exposure to the same antigen (or following sensitization after first exposure to a highly antigenic antigen such as urushiol).  In this phase, the hapten is taken up by skin cells and causes activation of hapten-sensitized T cells in the dermis and epidermis.  This results in an inflammatory response and the clinical manifestations of contact dermatitis. $Depending on the etiologic agent, contact dermatitis can be mediated primarily by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells or CD4+ TH1 cells (that cause indirect damage by activating macrophages).

  "explanation_2": "This patient with sudden-onset rash and hypotension after ingesting a likely allergen has #anaphylaxis#.  Anaphylaxis classically involves a @type 1 (immediate) hypersensitivity@ reaction to an antigen, resulting in IgE-mediated mast cell and basophil degranulation.  Sudden and #massive release of inflammatory mediators# (eg, histamine, leukotrienes) into the circulation can quickly lead to urticaria, oropharyngeal edema (eg, lip swelling), and shock (eg, hypotension, tachycardia). $#Epinephrine# is the only pharmacologic therapy that both decreases the release of inflammatory mediators from mast cells and addresses all other manifestations of anaphylaxis.  It binds to adrenergic receptors (eg, beta-2 receptors) on the surface of mast cells, #inhibiting mast cell degranulation#.  In addition, it #counteracts existing inflammatory effects# via widespread stimulation of alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors: $• Alpha-1: causes vasoconstriction and decreases vascular permeability, raising blood pressure and decreasing upper airway edema $• Beta-1: increases cardiac contractility and cardiac output, improving blood pressure and peripheral perfusion $• Beta-2: causes bronchodilation, relieving airflow obstruction $Because of its ability to both treat and prevent further inflammatory mediator effects, epinephrine is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis. $#(Choice A)#  @H1 antagonists@ (eg, diphenhydramine) block tissue histamine receptors, preventing the effects of circulating histamine on capillaries (eg, vasodilation, increased vascular permeability).  However, they do not decrease the mast cell release of histamine or other inflammatory mediators. $#(Choice B)#  Omalizumab is a monoclonal anti-IgE antibody that binds to free IgE at the same site where IgE normally binds to mast cell IgE Fc receptors.  It prevents receptor binding and decreases circulating IgE levels, which eventually induces IgE Fc receptor down-regulation to help stabilize mast cells. $#(Choice C)#  Zileuton, a medication commonly used in the management of asthma, decreases the leukocyte synthesis of leukotrienes by @inhibiting 5-lipoxygenase@.  This results in decreased leukotriene activity, reducing inflammation and bronchospasm. $#(Choice E)#  Glucocorticoids reduce inflammation by several mechanisms.  One such mechanism is by promoting eosinophil apoptosis, either directly or by decreasing production of IL-5, which usually promotes eosinophil survival.  This decreases the number of circulating eosinophils. $#Educational objective# Anaphylaxis is a type 1 (immediate) hypersensitivity reaction involving IgE-mediated mast cell and basophil degranulation.  Epinephrine is the primary treatment for anaphylaxis because it decreases further mast cell release of inflammatory mediators and counteracts existing systemic inflammatory effects (eg, shock, bronchoconstriction).

  "explanation_2": "Dyspnea, hypotension, and tachycardia soon after administration of β-lactam antibiotics are suggestive of anaphylactic shock.  Hypotension occurs in anaphylactic shock secondary to collapse of peripheral vascular resistance, increases in vascular permeability, and leakage of capillary fluid.  Stimulation of the smooth muscle tone within the bronchial wall, along with an increase in bronchial secretion, accounts for the dyspnea seen in anaphylaxis.  Skin symptoms (urticaria and angioedema) may occur secondary to vasodilatation and increased vascular permeability of skin capillaries.  Increases in GI smooth muscle tone may result in vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea. $Epinephrine is the drug of choice for the treatment of anaphylactic shock due to its ability to reverse all of the pathophysiologic mechanisms of anaphylaxis.  Stimulation of α1 receptors counteracts the vasodilatation of cutaneous and viscera vasculature, thus increasing blood pressure.  Epinephrine-mediated increases in cardiac contractility (β1 effect) and cardiac output also increase blood pressure and improve peripheral perfusion.  Epinephrine-induced stimulation of β2 receptors results in bronchodilatation, making it also a popular choice for the treatment of severe asthmatic reactions. $#(Choice A)#  Steroids inhibit inflammation by reducing capillary permeability and suppressing neutrophil activity.  Steroids also inhibit phospholipase A2, resulting in decreased formation of prostaglandin inflammatory mediators.  Because steroids anti-inflammatory effects are not acute, they are not effective in the acute treatment of life-threatening anaphylaxis.  Epinephrine should be given prior to steroids and antihistamines in the treatment of anaphylaxis. $#(Choice C)#  Norepinephrine has a predominantly alpha-1 adrenergic effect; thus, it can cause intense vasoconstriction, which may limit cardiac output.  Furthermore, it has little effect on the beta-2 adrenoceptor, so it has little or no bronchodilator action. $#(Choice D)#  Dobutamine is a synthetic drug with primary beta-1 adrenergic action that can cause an increased cardiac output without the other effects of epinephrine. $#(Choice E)#  Diphenhydramine is a first generation antihistamine drug that competitively inhibits peripheral H1 receptors in the GI tract, blood vessels, and respiratory tract.  Diphenhydramine may be used for the treatment of anaphylaxis after the patient is stabilized with epinephrine. $#Educational objective# Anaphylactic shock is characterized by vasodilatation, increased vascular permeability, and bronchoconstriction.  Epinephrine counteracts these physiological mechanisms and is the drug of choice for the treatment of anaphylaxis.  "

  "explanation_2": "$Low serum levels of C1 esterase inhibitor (and its substrate C4) are diagnostic of #hereditary angioedema#, an inherited autosomal dominant condition that causes episodes of painless, non-pitting, well-circumscribed edema.  The face, neck, lips, and tongue are most commonly affected, but internal organs may also be involved.  Angioedema affecting the tracheobronchial tree can cause respiratory obstruction and is potentially fatal.  Angioedema of the gastrointestinal tract manifests with abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. $Normally, #C1 esterase inhibitor# suppresses activation of the C1 complement component and therefore the rest of the classic complement pathway.  It also inactivates #kallikrein#, which catalyzes the conversion of kininogen to bradykinin.  In #hereditary# angioedema, low C1 esterase inhibitor activity leads to an increase in active kallikrein and bradykinin levels.  #Bradykinin #(along with C3a and C5a) mediate angioedema by increasing vasodilation and vascular permeability. $Angioedema may also occur as a side effect of #angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor# medications.  ACE normally catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I into angiotensin II.  ACE also converts bradykinin into inactive metabolites.  ACE inhibitors can therefore lead to #bradykinin accumulation#.  These medications should #not# be used in patients with hereditary angioedema as they may precipitate disease episodes. $#(Choice B)#  Furosemide can cause hypokalemia, hyperuricemia, and hypovolemia.  Ototoxicity may occur if furosemide is used with aminoglycosides. $#(Choice C)#  Methotrexate can cause hepatitis, pulmonary fibrosis, and bone marrow suppression. $#(Choice D)#  Metoprolol is a selective β1-adrenergic blocker with few side effects.  It may cause heart block in patients with conduction system disease and bronchoconstriction in asthmatic patients (rare due to β1 selectivity but can still occur). $#(Choice E)#  The most common side effect of penicillin is hypersensitivity. $#Educational objective# Angioedema can be hereditary (autosomal dominant) or acquired (associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitor treatment).  In hereditary angioedema, low C1 esterase inhibitor activity leads to increases in bradykinin activity.  ACE inhibitors should not be used in these patients.  "

In addition, wheals are not expected. $#(Choice B)#  Gram-positive bacterial enterotoxin is the cause of staphylococcal food poisoning, which can cause vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps.  However, symptoms typically occur 2-8 hours after ingestion (vs immediately) of contaminated food, and wheezing and wheals are not expected. $#(Choice C)#  Kallikrein-generated bradykinin plays a role in bradykinin-mediated angioedema (eg, hereditary, ACE inhibitor–related), which can cause bowel wall edema and result in nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.  In contrast to mast cell–mediated angioedema, bradykinin-mediated angioedema does not typically cause bronchospasm, urticaria, or hypotension. $#(Choice E)#  Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide is secreted by VIPomas, rare functioning neuroendocrine tumors most often located in the pancreas.  VIPomas can cause watery diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting; however, acute-onset hypotension, wheezing, and wheals are not expected. $#Educational objective# Anaphylaxis is an IgE-mediated response to an allergen that results in the release of histamine by mast cells and basophils.  Histamine causes widespread physiologic effects, including vasodilation and increased vascular permeability (eg, hypotension), increased catecholamine secretion (eg, tachycardia), and bronchoconstriction (eg, wheezing).

  "explanation_2": "This patient with throat tightness, dizziness, hypotension, and urticaria (ie, diffuse erythematous plaques) has #anaphylaxis,# a #type I (immediate) hypersensitivity# reaction that occurs in response to an allergen (eg, wasp venom). $In patients who will eventually develop anaphylaxis, the #initial exposure# to an allergen results in antibody class switching and the #production of allergen-specific IgE# by plasma cells.  The allergen-specific IgE then @binds to an IgE receptor@ on mast cells or basophils.  @Subsequent reexposure@ leads to allergen interaction with cell-bound IgE, IgE receptor aggregation, mast cell or basophil degranulation, and #release of chemical mediators# (histamine, prostaglandin, leukotrienes) that can cause anaphylactic shock. $Anaphylactic shock is characterized by profound #peripheral vasodilation#.  Arteriolar vasodilation causes decreased systemic vascular resistance and consequent hypotension; venular vasodilation causes decreased central venous pressure and reduces venous return to the right atrium.  In addition, the inflammatory chemical mediators #increase vascular permeability#, leading to large fluid shifts from the intravascular to the extravascular space; this #decreases intravascular volume# and worsens #hypotension#. $#(Choice A)#  Chemical mediators (eg, histamine) released from cardiac mast cells may exert negative ionotropic effects on the heart, decreasing cardiac contractility.  However, this is typically counterbalanced by the body's sympathetic response to anaphylaxis; increased sympathetic activity has a positive inotropic effect and increases the heart rate in an attempt to compensate for widespread peripheral vasodilation. $#(Choice C)#  Increased, not impaired, endogenous sympathetic nerve activity is the body's early compensatory response in anaphylaxis.  In response to anaphylaxis-induced hypotension, an intact @baroreceptor reflex@ leads to increased sympathetic activity, tachycardia, and compensatory vasoconstriction. $#(Choices D and E)#  A toxin-mediated decrease in myocardial contractility and an increase in capillary permeability occur in toxic shock syndrome (TSS).  Most cases are linked to a prolonged use of tampons and wound/nasal packing (not wasp envenomation), which provide a medium for Staphylococcus aureus to replicate and release an exotoxin (eg, TSS toxin 1) that is capable of nonspecifically activating T cells (ie, a @superantigen@).  The subsequent dramatic release of inflammatory cytokines results in increased capillary permeability and hypotension, as well as high fever and a diffuse, erythematous rash.  In addition, the exotoxin can directly inhibit myocardial function. $#Educational objective# n anaphylaxis, allergen exposure triggers widespread IgE-mediated release of inflammatory chemical mediators (eg, histamine, prostaglandin, leukotrienes).

  "explanation_2": "#Severe combined immune deficiency# (SCID) is a life-threatening immunodeficiency syndrome that presents in #infancy#.  It is caused by a variety of mutations in different genes that result in impaired T and B cell development and function.  This leads to compromised cell-mediated and humoral immunity with the eventual development of #severe viral and bacterial infections# as maternal immunity wanes.  Other common features include mucocutaneous candidiasis, persistent diarrhea, and failure to thrive.  Laboratory studies show very low or #absent CD3+ T cells# and #hypogammaglobulinemia#.  Thymic hypoplasia or aplasia is another common finding in infants with SCID due to severe T cell deficiency. $#(Choice A)#  Common variable immunodeficiency is a heterogenous condition caused by B and T cell dysfunction and characterized by hypogammaglobulinemia.  It presents with recurrent infections in adults and children (after the neonatal period).  While not entirely unaffected, cell-mediated immunity is not as impaired as in SCID and thymic aplasia is unlikely. $#(Choice B)#  DiGeorge syndrome (DGS) classically presents with craniofacial abnormalities, conotruncal cardiac anomalies, hypoplastic thymus, and hypocalcemia resulting from parathyroid hypoplasia.  Immunodeficiency can also occur and is related to the degree of thymic hypoplasia.  Although complete DGS (<1% of cases) is a form of SCID, the absence of other characteristic findings makes DGS a less likely diagnosis. $#(Choice D)#  In Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, functioning of both T and B cells is impaired due to abnormal cytoskeletal functioning.  Patients experience recurrent viral, bacterial, and fungal infections that generally worsen with age.  However, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome also typically causes bleeding due to thrombocytopenia and eczema. $#(Choice E)#  X-linked (Bruton's) agammaglobulinemia is an immunodeficiency syndrome caused by insufficient production of mature B cells, which predisposes mainly to recurrent infections with encapsulated pyogenic bacteria (eg, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae type B).  The quantity and functioning of T cells is generally not affected, so an absent thymic shadow is unlikely. $#Educational objective# Severe combined immune deficiency is characterized by combined T and B cell dysfunction.  It is a life-threatening condition that presents in infancy with severe bacterial and viral infections; mucocutaneous candidiasis; persistent diarrhea; and failure to thrive.

Xanthine oxidase deficiency leads to abnormally low levels of uric acid in the serum; it can also lead to renal calculi due to the relative insolubility of xanthine at urine's pH level. $#Educational objective# The second most common cause of severe combined immunodeficiency is autosomal recessive deficiency of adenosine deaminase, an enzyme necessary for the elimination of excess adenosine within cells.  Toxic levels of adenosine accumulate within lymphocytes in this condition, leading to lymphocyte cell death and resultant cellular and humoral immunodeficiency.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient with craniofacial abnormalities, recurrent sinopulmonary infections, and congenital heart disease most likely has a #22q11 deletion syndrome# (22qDS).  The various 22qDS phenotypes, including @DiGeorge syndrome@, are caused by loss of genes responsible for embryonic transformation of the pharyngeal apparatus (eg, head and neck structures) and the secondary heart field (eg, cardiac outflow tract).  The @third pouch@ is commonly affected, typically manifesting as #thymic hypoplasia# (eg, attenuation of the @thymic shadow@ on chest x-ray). $The thymus is the site of #T-cell maturation#, and its maldevelopment precludes the normal migration of mature T cells to secondary lymphoid organs.  In lymph nodes, mature T cells are found in high number within the #paracortex# (a region lying internal to the cortex, between the follicles and medulla).  Normally, this region will enlarge significantly during cell-mediated immune responses due to proliferation of cytotoxic and helper T cells.  The loss of mature T reservoirs in patients with 22qDS results in recurrent infections by viral, fungal, protozoan, and intracellular bacterial pathogens. $#(Choices A and E)#  B cells mature in the bone marrow before migrating to the periphery; in the lymph nodes, they cluster in the outer cortex as primary (inactive) follicles.  When exposed to antigens (aided by follicular T cells and dendritic cells), B cells begin proliferating and form a germinal center.  In x-linked agammaglobulinemia, B cells are unable to mature in the bone marrow, preventing migration and resulting in absent lymph node cortical follicles. $#(Choices B and C)#  The medulla of the lymph node consists of medullary cords (aggregates of reticular cells, plasma cells, and macrophages) and medullar sinuses. $#Educational objective# 22q11.2 microdeletion syndromes (eg, DiGeorge syndrome) may present with thymic hypoplasia (eg, thymic shadow attenuation).  Because the thymus is required for T-cell maturation, reservoirs that receive migrating mature T cells (eg, paracortex of lymph nodes) will be poorly developed.  In contrast, x-linked agammaglobulinemia halts B-cell maturation in the bone marrow, preventing migration to lymph node cortical follicles.  ",

  "explanation_2": "$This boy developed fever, irritability, and local inflammatory symptoms (eg, redness, tenderness, swelling) within hours of vaccination, indicating #reactogenicity#, an inflammatory reaction that occurs shortly after vaccination. $Vaccinations typically inject a foreign, unencountered antigen into subcutaneous tissue in order to promote the development of adaptive immunity against the antigen.  However, foreign antigens can also trigger a #rapid-onset innate immune response# driven by the presence of #pattern recognition receptors# (eg, toll-like receptors) on local stromal and local/circulating immune cells (eg, #macrophages#, monocytes, mast cells). $Pattern recognition receptors identify conserved motifs present on many pathogens (eg, lipopolysaccharide).  Activation of these receptors leads to the release of #pyrogenic cytokines# (eg, TNF-alpha, IL-1, #IL-6#), which can cause #local inflammation# (eg, edema, warmth, swelling) due to increased vascular permeability/immune cell recruitment and #systemic inflammation# (eg, fever, irritability, fatigue, headache) due to increased circulating inflammatory cytokines. $Many vaccines also contain #adjuvants# (eg, aluminum salts, virosomes, oil-in-water) to increase the immune response to the injected antigen.  Adjuvants are strongly immunostimulatory and frequently increase the risk of reactogenicity.  However, manifestations of reactogenicity tend to improve 24-36 hours after vaccination. $#(Choices A and C)#  Dendritic cells are antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that display foreign antigens on their surface on major histocompatibility complex class II molecules.  CD4 T lymphocytes with antigen-specific receptors bind to the antigen on the APCs and are costimulated by the interaction between CD80/86 on the APCs and CD28 on the T-cell surface.  Activated CD4 T-cells then increase display of @CD40 ligand@, which binds CD40 on the APC, leading to full APC maturation.  These adaptive immune responses take several days to form and do not cause local reactions soon after vaccination. $#(Choice B)#  Cytotoxic T-cells recognize a foreign antigen on major histocompatibility complex class I and release perforins to induce cell lysis; they primarily attack cells infected by intracellular pathogens (eg, viruses).  Cytotoxic T-cells do not significantly contribute to vaccination reactions within hours of vaccination. $#(Choice E)#  Some activated B-cells differentiate into short-lived plasma cells that secrete IgM.  However, this typically takes several days to occur and would not cause local inflammatory symptoms. $#Educational objective# Vaccine reactogenicity is a local (eg, warmth, swelling, edema) and systemic (eg, fatigue, fever, headache) inflammatory reaction to the vaccine due to the innate immune response.  It is primarily caused by pattern recognition receptors present on the surface of macrophages and mast cells, which identify the antigen and release inflammatory cytokines (eg, IL-1, IL-6).  ",

  "explanation_2": "$This patient likely experienced traumatic splenic rupture 2 years ago with the splenic remnants removed during laparotomy (spleen is the most commonly injured organ with blunt abdominal trauma).  He subsequently experienced overwhelming #asplenic sepsis#, a condition that carries a 50% mortality risk. $The #spleen# is a part of the systemic lymphoid system and receives roughly 6% of the cardiac output.  Many of the splenic capillaries are open-ended and sinusoidal, permitting whole blood to flow into the red pulp cords.  These cords form a reticular meshwork that acts as a fine sieve with spaces as small as 1 micron in diameter.  Large numbers of macrophages line the red pulp cords and sinusoids and ingest any particulate matter that becomes trapped.  The splenic red pulp is important for:  $1. Destroying aged and #abnormal erythrocytes# (eg, spherocytes) and serving as an emergency store of blood cells and platelets that can be delivered into the circulation when needed.  $2. Clearance of #circulating bacteria# that become lodged in the cords.  Macrophages then present captured antigens to the B- and T-cells residing in the splenic white pulp to generate an active immune response. $Nearly half of the body's total immunoglobulins are produced by splenic B-lymphocytes.  Splenic #opsonizing antibody# is of particular importance in the clearance of #encapsulated species#, as the capsule allows them to resist innate phagocytosis.  Vaccination against encapsulated bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis is recommended for all asplenic patients. $#(Choice A)#  The liver is the primary site for complement production.  C3 deficiency predisposes to recurrent infections with encapsulated organisms.  Deficiencies of C5-9, the components of the membrane attack complex, can lead to recurrent infections with N meningitidis or N gonorrhoeae. $#(Choice B)#  Immediate hypersensitivity results from IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation.  It is not affected by splenectomy. $#(Choice C)#  Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a condition where catalase-positive organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus are phagocytosed but cannot be killed effectively.  Patients experience recurrent suppurative infections (eg, abscesses). $#(Choice E)#  Interferons α and β are released from virally-infected cells and cause macrophage and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activation, leading to destruction of infected cells.  Defects in type I interferon release lead to increased susceptibility to viral infections. $#Educational objective# The spleen acts as both a blood filter capable of removing circulating pathogens and as a major site of opsonizing antibody synthesis.  Asplenic patients are prone to infections caused by encapsulated organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis.  "
