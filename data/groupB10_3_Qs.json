PAM is caused by #Naegleria fowleri#, a free-living, motile, protozoan parasite that lives in warm water and soil worldwide.  Exposure primarily occurs when humans inadvertently inhale the organism during #recreational water activities# such as swimming, diving, or using hot springs.  Most individuals do not become ill, but a minority develop fatal meningoencephalitis after N fowleri penetrates the olfactory mucosa, crosses the cribriform plate, and invades the olfactory bulb. $Patients with PAM usually develop acute confusion, high fever, photophobia, and meningeal symptoms (eg, neck stiffness, headache).  Lumbar puncture opening pressures are often markedly elevated, and CSF analysis typically reveals neutrophilic pleocytosis, high protein, and low glucose.  Suspicion is usually raised when CSF testing is negative for bacterial, viral, or fungal pathogens.  The diagnosis is confirmed when #wet mount# of the CSF reveals #motile trophozoites# (the activated, feeding form of certain protozoa).

Within days to a few weeks, liver schizonts rupture the hepatocytes, releasing thousands of merozoites into the bloodstream. $Merozoites from different species of malaria have different affinities for erythrocytes.  Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale primarily infect very young, large erythrocytes recently released from the bone marrow (ie, reticulocytes), whereas Plasmodium malariae primarily infects old erythrocytes that have been in the bloodstream for months.  In contrast, #Plasmodium falciparum# has the unique ability to infect #erythrocytes of all ages#. $Because P falciparum can target a much larger pool of erythrocytes, patients infected with this species typically have much #greater levels of parasitemia# than those infected with other species.  In addition, P falciparum has a unique ability to significantly increase cytoadherence molecules on the surface of infected erythrocytes, leading to increased risk for microvascular adhesion with subsequent tissue ischemia.  The combination of a high degree of parasitemia and a high risk for #microvascular adhesion# make P falciparum the most severe and deadly species of malaria. $#(Choice A)#  All Plasmodium species that cause malaria rely primarily on anaerobic metabolism because they are unable to perform oxidative phosphorylation in their mitochondria.  Parasite anaerobic glycolysis likely contributes to the hypoglycemia and acidosis (eg, lactic acidosis) typically seen in severe malaria. $#(Choice B)#  All Plasmodium species that cause malaria digest hemoglobin in vacuoles to supply the parasite with amino acids.

Transmission occurs when the bug feeds on human blood during the night and defecates the underlying pathogen, #Trypanosoma cruzi#, into the bite wound. $Chagas disease is divided into 2 phases: $• The acute phase (8-12 weeks after transmission) is characterized by circulating @trypomastigotes@ that are detectable on blood microscopy.  Most patients are asymptomatic, but a minority develop nonspecific symptoms (eg, fever, malaise, anorexia) and inflammation/swelling at the site of inoculation (eg, eye swelling following conjunctival inoculation). $• The chronic phase begins when the immune system eliminates circulating parasitemia, leading to resolution of acute symptoms.  Patients subsequently develop a prolonged asymptomatic phase (\"indeterminate form\"), whereby serology is positive for T cruzi, but there are no symptoms, signs, detectable parasitemia, or indications of end-organ damage.  After 1-3 decades, a minority of those with asymptomatic chronic infection develop end-organ disease of the heart or gastrointestinal system. $#Chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy# is the most common complication of Chagas disease.

These pathogens are called hookworms because the head of the worm is often curved away from the body, giving the organism a \"hooked\" appearance.  Most cases occur in #tropical and subtropical# regions where sanitation is poor.  Transmission occurs when #egg-containing human feces# is deposited into shady, warm, moist soil, which allows the eggs to hatch into larvae.  Spread occurs when larvae come into direct #contact with human skin# (eg, when walking barefoot). $Dermal penetration often results in a transient, pruritic, maculopapular or serpiginous rash at the entry site.  The larvae then spread through the bloodstream to the lungs, where they rupture into the alveoli and are subsequently coughed up and swallowed.  In the small intestine, the larvae mature into adults, attach to the gastrointestinal mucosa, and feed on human blood by lacerating capillaries.  Because these organisms can live in the gastrointestinal tract for up to 14 years, total blood loss can be substantial.  Therefore, the biggest risk of hookworm infection is iron-deficiency anemia #(microcytic anemia)# due to chronic blood loss. $Although many patients with hookworm infection are asymptomatic for months or years, some individuals develop transient pulmonary symptoms (eg, cough) during pulmonary migration or gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) during gastrointestinal migration.

Transmission typically occurs when humans walk barefoot on ground contaminated with human feces. $Filariform larvae in the soil #penetrate the skin#, travel through the bloodstream/lymphatics, and enter the alveoli.  They ascend the tracheobronchial tree and are swallowed.  The larvae mature into adult worms in the gastrointestinal tract, enter the mucosa of the duodenum and jejunum, and secrete noninfectious rhabditiform larvae into stool for excretion.  A few @rhabditiform larvae@ mature into filiform larvae in the gastrointestinal tract and reinfect the host through the intestinal mucosa or perianal skin (autoinoculation). $Many patients are asymptomatic because the host immune system keeps the organism in check; however, symptoms may emerge in the setting of #immunocompromise# due to medications (eg, #glucocorticoid therapy#) or comorbid illness (eg, cancer, HIV).  Common manifestations include the following: $• #Larva currens:#  Larvae migrate through cutaneous tissue near the site of penetration, leaving narrow, reddish-brown streaks. $• #Pulmonary symptoms:#  Larvae passing through the lungs can cause dyspnea, wheezing, and dry cough. $• #Gastrointestinal symptoms:#  Larvae in the gastrointestinal tract can cause diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal pain. $Most patients also have peripheral #eosinophilia#.  The diagnosis is typically made when rhabditiform larvae are identified in the stool or, less commonly, sputum. $#(Choice A)#  Mosquitos can transmit viral (eg, dengue) and parasitic (eg, malaria) infections.  However, these illnesses cause high fever and other systemic symptoms shortly after transmission.  Eosinophilia and a nematode (ie, roundworm) in the sputum are more suggestive of helminth infection. $#(Choice B)#  Borrelia burgdorferi, a spirochete, is transmitted by Ixodes scapularis tick bite.  It causes Lyme disease, which typically presents with a migrating, target-shaped rash that may progress to involve the nervous system or joints.  Gastrointestinal/pulmonary symptoms and eosinophilia indicate an alternate diagnosis. $#(Choice D)#  Ingestion of oocysts is a common mode of transmission for protozoan parasites (eg, Giardia, Cryptosporidium), which often cause diarrhea and crampy abdominal pain.  However, a nematode on sputum microscopy indicates a helminth (ie, parasitic worm) infection; helminths (eg, strongyloidiasis, ascariasis, schistosomiasis) produce eggs (containing multicellular embryos), not oocysts (thick-walled spores). $#(Choice E)#  Inhalation of spores can cause a variety of pulmonary fungal infections (eg, histoplasmosis, aspergillosis).  Although these pathogens can cause peripheral eosinophilia and pulmonary symptoms, helminths would not be seen in sputum samples. $#Educational objective# Strongyloides stercoralis is transmitted in tropical/subtropical climates when human skin comes into direct contact with filariform larvae.  The larvae penetrate the skin, enter the bloodstream, pass through the lungs, and are swallowed into the digestive system.  Common manifestations include linear skin rash and irritative digestive/respiratory symptoms.  ","clickable_1":"images/img1.20848.jpg"},

Transmission occurs when an infected female Anopheles mosquito injects the parasite while blood feeding.  To prevent infection, travelers to @malaria-endemic regions@ should be counseled on mosquito-avoidance measures and given chemoprophylaxis. $#Mosquito avoidance# strategies include staying indoors at dawn/dusk (when mosquitos are most active), wearing insect repellant, limiting exposed skin, and sleeping within insecticide-treated nets.  #Chemoprophylaxis# targets the predominant species of the region and considers the presence of drug resistance.

Because Plasmodium species mature in the liver over 8-30 days, patients must generally continue chemoprophylaxis for a period after return from travel to ensure merozoites released from the liver are destroyed when they infect red blood cells.  Chemoprophylaxis is particularly important for individuals at greatest risk for severe disease, particularly those with malnutrition, splenectomy, and #HIV#. $#(Choice A)#  Patients with HIV who do not adhere to antiretroviral therapy are at high risk for opportunistic infections.  In this case, the presence of ring-shaped forms within erythrocytes is highly suggestive of malaria; although symptoms are often more severe in patients with advanced HIV, antiretroviral therapy does not prevent malarial infection. $#(Choice C)#  Patients with HIV are at much greater risk for pneumococcal infection compared to the general population.  Therefore, vaccination is generally recommended.  Pneumococcus typically causes pneumonia, bloodstream infection, or meningitis, not intraerythrocytic ring forms on blood smear. $#(Choice D)#  Sulfadiazine-pyrimethamine is first-line treatment for toxoplasmosis, a common opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS.  Toxoplasmosis usually causes encephalitis (eg, delirium, headache, focal deficits, seizure), but pneumonitis or retinitis can occasionally occur.  It is usually diagnosed with imaging and/or serology, but tissue microscopy would show cysts or tachyzoites, not intraerythrocytic ring forms. $#(Choice E)#  Ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis are transmitted by ticks and can be visualized on peripheral blood smear.  However, both appear as intracytoplasmic inclusions (morulae) within neutrophils (Anaplasma) or monocytes (Ehrlichia); ring-shaped intraerythrocytic erythrocyte inclusions are not seen. $#Educational objective# Malaria is diagnosed when intraerythrocytic, diamond ring–shaped parasites are seen on peripheral blood smear.  This disease should be suspected in travelers to endemic regions who develop a febrile illness.  It can generally be prevented with mosquito-avoidance measures and chemoprophylaxis.
