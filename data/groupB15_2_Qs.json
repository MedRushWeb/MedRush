However, if 100,000 loci are studied at that 5% (ie, 0.05, 5 √ó 10‚àí2) level, then 100,000 √ó 0.05 = 5,000 false positives would be expected.  With a much smaller p-value, this number decreases substantially.  For this reason, a p-value of 5 √ó 10‚àí8 (\"genome-wide p-value\"), as seen here, is often chosen in GWAS. $#(Choice A)#  A meta-analysis combines results from different studies, thereby increasing sample size, which increases power (eg, to detect statistical differences between groups). $#(Choice B)#  Logistic regression was used because it analyzes the association between exposures (eg, multiple loci) and binary outcomes (eg, yes = cases with RA; no = controls without RA). $#(Choice C)#  An odds ratio (OR) <1 does not imply a lack of statistically significant association.  If an OR >1 means that patients with RA have higher odds of having a specific locus compared to those without RA (ie, risk factor), an OR <1 means that patients with RA have lower odds of having that specific locus (ie, protective factor).  The OR for the association between Locus 1 and RA is statistically significant because its p-value (3.5 √ó 10‚àí8) is less than the genome-wide p-value (5 √ó 10‚àí8). $#(Choice E)#  GWAS help explain disease heritability (ie, effect of genotypic differences on phenotypic differences).  Although this study identified 3 new loci, there is no indication that the full group of 33 loci will explain most RA disease heritability.  GWAS have identified many genes associated with specific conditions, but these genes only seem to explain a small amount of the variance (\"missing heritability\"). $#Educational objective# Genome-wide association studies aim to identify associations between thousands of genetic variants and a disease.  Because of the increased risk of false-positive results when multiple tests are performed simultaneously, a smaller genome-wide p-value is typically used. "},

Because the exposure status is determined at the time of enrollment in the study, recall bias is #minimized#. $#(Choice A)#  Allocation bias can result from the way patients are assigned to the treatment and control groups.  It may occur when subjects are nonrandomly assigned to the study groups of a clinical trial (eg, physicians may preferentially enroll sicker patients into the experimental group).  Allocation bias is different from selection bias, which occurs when the studied sample does not represent the general population (eg, because of nonrandom selection). $#(Choice B)#  Detection bias refers to the fact that a risk factor itself may lead to extensive diagnostic investigation and increase the probability that a disease is identified.  For instance, patients who smoke may undergo increased imaging surveillance due to their smoking status, which would detect more cases of cancer in general. $#(Choice D)#  Referral (admission rate) bias occurs when the case and control populations differ due to admission or referral practices.  For instance, a study involving asbestos as a risk factor for lung cancer conducted at a hospital specializing in treating asbestosis may select patients with lung cancer (cases) from the respiratory department and a control group without lung cancer from other departments.  Because the hospital specializes in asbestosis treatment, patients in the respiratory department with lung cancer are more likely to have a history of asbestos exposure (compared to patients with lung cancer at other, nonspecialized institutions).  Therefore, the study may erroneously report a stronger association than actually exists. $#(Choice E)#  Selection bias occurs when the method of selection used in a particular study results in selection sample of participants who are not representative of the intended population.  A common example is patients with cancer who fail standard therapy and who are therefore the most likely to enroll in experimental trials (self-selection), leading to results that are not applicable to patients with less advanced cancers. $#Educational objective# Recall bias results from study participants' inaccurate recall of past exposure and occurs most often in retrospective studies such as case-control studies.

If these lost subjects had a higher incidence of breast cancer than those remaining in the study, then a selective loss of high-risk subjects would have occurred in the exposed group.

The \"standard deviation\" of a series of sample means is known as the #standard error# (#SE#) of the mean, and it estimates how far the sample mean is likely to be from the unknown population mean.  The SE is estimated considering both the SD and the size of the sample (n) in the following manner:  #SD/‚àön#. $A sample mean is a point estimate of the true population mean; however, a #confidence interval# (#CI#) better accounts for the variability due to sampling by including the SE in its calculation.  The CI of the mean can be calculated as follows: $‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ CI of mean = mean ¬± [z-score for confidence level] √ó [SE] $where the z-score for confidence level represents the number of SEs containing the desired percentage of observations around the mean (eg, 95%, 99%).  In this case, the 95% CI can be calculated: $‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ CI of mean = #mean ¬± 1.96 √ó (SD/‚àön)# $The sample size and the SD of the sample determine the magnitude of the variability due to sampling.  As n increases, SE decreases, and the CI becomes narrower and more precise.  Conversely, as the SD increases, SE increases, and the CI becomes wider and less precise. $#(Choice A)#  CI estimates use the SE of the mean, which takes into account the SD and the size of the sample (n).  As such, the equation divides the SD by the square root of n. $#(Choices C, D, and E)#  As noted, the SD reflects the spread of individual values in a normal distribution.  Multiplying the SD by a specific constant (z-score) gives us a range of values that encompass a certain proportion of the observations.  The mean ¬± 1 √ó SD would cover 68% of the observations, and the mean ¬± 2.58 √ó SD would cover 99% of the observations.  However, the question is asking for a 95% CI, so the equation should use a z-score of 1.96 and the SE (ie, SD/‚àön). $#Educational objective# The standard deviation reflects the spread of individual values in a normal distribution (ie, it measures the variability of the observations within a single sample).  The standard error of the mean reflects the variability of means (ie, variance between the means of different samples) and helps estimate the true mean of the underlying population.

In this case, it represents the odds that the outcome (eg, major arrhythmia) occurred in the presence of the exposure (eg, beta blocker use) compared with the odds that the outcome occurred in the absence of that exposure.  The OR can be calculated using a standard contingency table (with exposures in the rows and outcomes in the columns).$","explanation_2":"$Odds of developing major arrhythmia in exposed group = 20/70 $Odds of developing major arrhythmia in unexposed group = 30/40 $(note that the total number of people in the exposed and unexposed groups is #not# used to calculate odds, unlike calculating probabilities) $Therefore, the OR of developing a major arrhythmia in patients who took beta blockers compared with those who did not is as follows: $‚Ä¢ (a/b) / (c/d) = (20/70) / (30/40) = (20 √ó 40) / (70 √ó 30) = 0.38 $In this case, the OR calculated was the OR of disease (among exposed individuals relative to nonexposed individuals), given by (a/b) / (c/d); in some cases, the OR of exposure (among diseased individuals relative to nondiseased individuals) is calculated, given by (a/c) / (b/d).  Both OR definitions are mathematically equivalent and reduce (by a @mathematical shortcut@) to: OR = ad/bc.  Any of these formulas would give the same result. $Because the OR is <1, the odds of developing a major arrhythmia is lower for patients who were taking beta blockers compared with those who were not. $#(Choice E)#  Relative risk (RR) is the probability of an outcome occurring in the exposed group compared with the probability of the outcome occurring in the unexposed group.  It is calculated using the following formula: $‚Ä¢ RR = [a/(a + b)] / [c/(c + d)] = (20/90) / (30/70) $RR often has more clinical utility than the OR since it gives the change in disease risk based on the presence or absence of risk factors.  However, RR cannot be calculated in case-control studies as patients are preselected based on disease status (cases and controls) instead of being sorted into exposure groups and followed over time to assess disease outcomes. $#Educational objective# The odds ratio (OR) is a measure of the strength of an association between an exposure and an outcome.

Other laboratory analysis methods involve performing more specific calculations when it is important to detect a difference in one direction (eg, for a cancer marker, knowing that the value is significantly higher than normal is more important than knowing that it is significantly different‚Äîeither higher or lower‚Äîthan normal).  In some cases, high-sensitivity assays (eg, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein testing) allow the detection of values in the lower range of normal, which would not have been possible with standard assays. $#Educational objective# In a normal (bell-shaped) distribution, 68% of all values are within 1 standard deviation (SD) from the mean; 95% are within 2 SD from the mean; and 99.7% are within 3 SD from the mean.

An example is shown in the @exhibit@.  In a primary school, it may appear on crude analysis that students with bigger shoe sizes have a higher level of intelligence.  However, this association is actually a result of age, not shoe size: Older students tend to have bigger shoe sizes and also to be more intelligent.  Age is a confounder because it is associated with both shoe size and intelligence and muddles the association between them.  When study subjects are grouped by age (#stratification#), the association between shoe size and intelligence is no longer significant. $Similarly, initial crude analysis suggested that alcohol use was associated with bladder carcinoma (similar to shoe size being associated with intelligence), with a relative risk (RR) of 1.81 and a p-value <0.05.  However, smoking is associated with both bladder carcinoma and alcohol use.  Therefore, #smoking# is a potential confounder that may explain the association observed between alcohol use and bladder cancer (similar to age in the school example).  Stratified analysis by smoking status shows that both smokers and non-smokers have an RR ~1 with large p-values (>0.05).  The RR of 1.81 found on crude analysis disappears and there is no true association between alcohol consumption and bladder cancer. $#(Choice B)#  #Effect modification# results when an external variable positively or negatively impacts the observed effect of a risk factor on disease status.  When analysis is performed based on stratification by this external variable, there will be a significant difference in risk between the stratified groups.  For instance, aspirin use is associated with Reye syndrome in children but not adults; therefore, age modifies the effect of aspirin on Reye syndrome development.  Effect modification can easily be confused with confounding; but stratified analysis can help distinguish between them.  With confounding, there is usually no significant difference between the strata (as in this case with the smoker and non-smoker strata). $#(Choices C and E)#  Measurement bias and observer bias distort the strength of association by misclassifying exposed/unexposed and/or diseased/nondiseased subjects.  The scenario does not describe any issues that could affect the classification process. $#(Choice D)#  Meta-analysis refers to compiling results from several studies to increase analysis power. $#(Choice F)#  Recall bias results from inaccurate recall of past exposure by people in the study and applies mostly to retrospective (eg, case-control) studies. $#Educational objective# Confounding occurs when the exposure-disease relationship is muddled by the effect of an extraneous factor associated with both exposure and disease.  Confounding bias can result in the false association of an exposure with a disease. ","clickable_1":"images/img1.1173.jpg"}
