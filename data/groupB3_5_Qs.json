Chagas disease is caused by infection with the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, which is transmitted by the triatomine 'kissing' bug (Reduviid family) found throughout the Americas as far north as the southern United States.  Infection is rare in developed regions, but the disease is endemic throughout #Central and South America# where widespread open-air and thatched-roof housing exposes individuals to routine contact with the triatomine vector. $ Years following initial infection, some individuals develop serious end-organ damage affecting the cardiac, gastrointestinal, and/or central nervous systems.

Chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy is relatively unique among DCMs in that there is characteristically localized #apical wall thinning# with the development of a large apical #aneurysm#.  In addition to impairing ventricular systolic function, the aneurysm can harbor #mural thrombus# that may systemically embolize and cause stroke.  Damage to the cardiac conduction system can also trigger #ventricular arrhythmias# (eg, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation) that can lead to sudden cardiac death (the likely cause of death in this patient). $ The gastrointestinal manifestations of Chagas disease result from destruction of the myenteric plexus, which can lead to progressive dilation and dysfunction of the esophagus and, less commonly, the colon. $ #(Choices A, C, D, and E)#  Excessive alcohol consumption can lead to DCM.  Measles, mumps, and rubella are typically vaccinated against in childhood and are potential causes of viral DCM.  Genetic mutations of the gene encoding for the cardiac sarcomere protein titin can lead to familial DCM.  Miners and metal workers who are exposed to high levels of cobalt can develop DCM.

Numerous viruses, including coxsackievirus, adenovirus, influenza, and HIV have been implicated.  Histopathology of viral myocarditis typically shows #myocyte necrosis or degeneration# accompanied by an #inflammatory mononuclear cell infiltrate# primarily consisting of lymphocytes with some macrophages.  Other less common etiologies of acute myocarditis, including bacterial, parasitic, and rheumatologic, can have a similar histologic appearance but may demonstrate additional findings (eg, granulomas in mycobacterial disease, visible organisms in parasitic disease). $ The clinical presentation of acute myocarditis can vary significantly; many patients remain asymptomatic with subclinical infection, but some experience severe complications including decompensated #heart failure# (eg, dyspnea, fatigue, peripheral edema) due to #dilated cardiomyopathy#.  Ventricular arrhythmias leading to #sudden cardiac death# (SCD) can also occur.$ (Choice B)  @Cardiac amyloidosis@ involves deposition of abnormal proteins in myocardial tissue and typically manifests as restrictive cardiomyopathy initially.  SCD can occur, but histopathology demonstrates pink amorphous material (amyloid) surrounding cardiomyocytes. $ (Choice C)  Congenital long QT syndrome can trigger ventricular arrhythmias and lead to SCD; however, histopathology is generally unremarkable and would not demonstrate myocardial necrosis with inflammatory infiltrate. $ (Choice D)  Coronary artery disease can lead to SCD by triggering ventricular arrhythmia, either in the setting of acute myocardial infarction or chronic ischemic heart disease.  However, microscopic changes in the early stages of acute myocardial infarction include areas of coagulative necrosis and subsequent neutrophilic infiltrate, and @chronic ischemic heart disease@ typically shows evidence of healed myocardial infarctions (eg, collagenous scars).  In addition, this patient's relatively young age and short duration of preceding exertional symptoms make acute myocarditis more likely. $ (Choice E) @Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy@ is characterized by cardiac myocyte disarray and interstitial fibrosis that can predispose to ventricular arrhythmia and SCD.  An inflammatory infiltrate is not expected. $ Educational objective Acute myocarditis is most commonly caused by a viral infection (eg, coxsackievirus, adenovirus, influenza).  It often resolves without noticeable symptoms, but patients can develop serious complications, including decompensated heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy or sudden cardiac death due to ventricular arrhythmia.  Histopathology typically demonstrates myocyte necrosis with inflammatory mononuclear infiltrate.","clickable_1":"images/img1.14789.jpg","clickable_2":"images/img2.14789.jpg","clickable_3":"images/img3.14789.jpg"},

With inspiration, a reduction in intrathoracic pressure pulls additional blood into the right side of the heart and the pulmonary circulation, causing normal inspiratory collapse of the inferior vena cava (IVC). $With cardiac tamponade, increasing pericardial pressure begins to compress the relatively low-pressure, #right-sided heart chambers# and #restrict diastolic filling#.  The increased right-sided pressures are transmitted backward to the vena cava, causing #engorgement of the IVC# with decreased inspiratory collapse that can be seen on echocardiography.  In addition, because the right ventricle is compressed and unable to expand during diastole, the increase in right-sided blood flow during inspiration causes the ventricular septum to bow into the left ventricle; this reduces left ventricular stroke volume during inspiration and is responsible for the observed >10 mm Hg drop in systolic blood pressure. $As tamponade progresses, impaired right-sided filling causes the left ventricle to receive less blood, resulting in decreased cardiac output and #obstructive shock#.  Because the obstruction to blood flow is primarily right sided, there is no pulmonary edema and the lungs remain clear to auscultation. $#(Choices A, B, D, and E)#  A segmental (eg, apical) wall motion abnormality suggests myocardial ischemia or infarction, dilation of all 4 cardiac chambers is seen with dilated cardiomyopathy, severe tricuspid regurgitation can occur with carcinoid syndrome, and systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve is seen with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (and often exacerbates obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract).  None of these conditions are expected to cause pulsus paradoxus or distant heart sounds. $#Educational objective# Cardiac tamponade involves restriction of diastolic filling of the right-sided heart chambers, with engorgement and decreased inspiratory collapse of the inferior vena cava seen on echocardiography.  Pulsus paradoxus (>10 mm Hg drop in systolic blood pressure during inspiration) is commonly present with tamponade.  ","clickable_1":"images/img1.20257.jpg"},
