It is a tetramer consisting of two alpha and two beta chains.  Normally the synthesis of alpha and beta chains is tightly regulated such that one α-chain is synthesized for every β-chain.  Hemoglobin formation begins within a few weeks of conception.  The initial hemoglobin formed by a fetus in utero is called embryonic hemoglobin (Gower).  This hemoglobin is composed of two zeta (ζ) and two epsilon (ε) chains (ζ2ε2) and is produced in the embryonic yolk sac.  Within a few weeks the fetal liver starts synthesizing hemoglobin F (fetal hemoglobin).  This form of hemoglobin is composed of two alpha and two gamma chains (α2γ2).  HbF is the major hemoglobin in the fetus during last few months of gestation and in infants during first few weeks of postnatal life.  HbA synthesis starts during the final month of gestation and gradually replaces HbF during postnatal life.  Knowing the chronology of fetal hemoglobin formation and the gradual transition to adult hemoglobin (HbA) is important in understanding the relationship between clinical manifestations and postnatal age in beta thalassemia. $Thalassemias are hereditary hemolytic anemias resulting from defective synthesis of globin chains.  As described above, the synthesis of alpha and beta globin chains is very coordinated.  In patients with thalassemia, the synthesis of either alpha or beta chains is defective.  Beta thalassemia is caused by defective synthesis of beta chains.  There are two copies of the beta globin gene (one from each parent).  If only one gene is defective the patient will have beta thalassemia trait (beta thalassemia minor) and lack significant anemia.  A defect in both beta globin genes results in severe hemolytic anemia known as beta thalassemia major.  In this disease, alpha chains are produced normally but they cannot form stable tetramers due to the lack of beta globin chains.  This failure to form stable hemoglobin leads to precipitation of alpha globin chains and premature lysis of red blood cells.  Beta thalassemia cannot become symptomatic as long as there are significant amounts of gamma chains present because gamma chains make up for the absence of HbA beta chains in forming tetramers.  Thus, in late gestation and early postnatal life, the expression of hemoglobin A is offset by gamma chain production #(choice C).#  As gamma chain production wanes, patients will become symptomatic. $#(Choice A)# α-globin is a normal component of both HbA and HbF.  α-globin synthesis is defective in α-thalassemia but it is normal in β-thalassemia.  α-globin is able to combine with γ-globin to form HbF.  This allows patients with β-thalassemia major to be asymptomatic in utero and in the first few months following birth. $#(Choice B)# β-globin synthesis is defective in patients with b-thalassemia. $#(Choice D)# δ-globin is a minor globin gene that is expressed at very low levels in normal adults.  Two α-globins and two δ-globins combine to form hemoglobin A2. $#(Choice E)# ζ-globin is a component of hemoglobin Gower, the initial hemoglobin formed by the embryo very early in embryogenesis. $#Educational objective# HbF contains γ-globin instead of β-globin.  Patients with homozygotic β-thalassemia (β-thalassemia major) are asymptomatic at birth due to the presence of γ-globins and HbF.  Switching to HbA production and the cessation of  γ-globin synthesis precipitates the symptoms of β-thalassemia.  "},

Breastmilk contains only a low concentration of iron.  Therefore, breastfed infants who do not receive additional iron-rich foods are at risk for developing iron deficiency. $Iron deficiency progresses through the following stages:  $1. #Decreased iron storage#:  When there is a net negative iron balance, iron is first removed from the storage pool (eg, hepatocytes, reticuloendothelial system); iron is stored intracellularly within ferritin complexes.  Ferritin is also found in the blood, and serum levels generally fluctuate in proportion to iron stores.  Therefore, the body's depletion of storage iron can be detected through a #low serum ferritin level#.  $2. #Iron-limited erythropoiesis#:  As iron stores become depleted, serum iron levels decrease, followed by a compensatory #rise in transferrin# and a resultant decrease in transferrin saturation #(choice E).#  During this phase, there is iron-limited erythropoiesis, in which newly made erythrocytes (ie, reticulocytes) are iron deficient and reticulocyte production may begin to be limited.  Because mature erythrocytes have a slow turnover (ie, 120 days), most cells sampled during this stage still have normal morphology, and the total hemoglobin value may still be normal.  $3. #Iron deficiency anemia#:  If iron deficiency continues, the last phase is frank iron deficiency anemia, which is reflected by a low hemoglobin level with #microcytosis# (low mean corpuscular volume [MCV]) and #hypochromia# (low mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration [MCHC]) in most erythrocytes #(choices B and C)#.

The earliest stage involves loss of iron in storage (decreased serum ferritin), followed by iron-limited erythropoiesis with decreased serum iron and transferrin saturation.

Young women often develop IDA from heavy menstruation. $Patients with severe IDA do not have enough iron to generate adequate hemoglobin for each erythrocyte, which results in low mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (hypochromia) and small erythrocyte size (microcytosis).  Interstitial fibroblasts in the peritubular capillaries and proximal convoluted tubule of the kidney detect the reduced oxygen carrying capacity of the blood (mild tissue hypoxia) and #increase erythropoietin release# to drive the generation of new erythrocytes.  However, new erythrocytes cannot be produced at a level to compensate for the anemia due to insufficient serum iron; therefore, patients typically have #minimal reticulocytes# and #low red blood cell counts# in the peripheral blood. $#(Choice A)#  Transferrin is a serum protein that binds free iron.  The concentration of transferrin is increased in IDA (to maximize free iron scavenge), but the amount of iron bound to it is reduced, leading to a low transferrin saturation on laboratory evaluation. $#(Choices B, C, and E)#  Hepcidin is a small peptide released by the liver in response to inflammation.  It binds to and inhibits iron channels on the surface of enterocytes and on reticuloendothelial macrophages, which reduces iron absorption in the gut and reduces iron release from the reticuloendothelial system (the primary site of iron recycling).  Because IDA is not mediated by inflammation, hepcidin levels are typically low; this increases gastrointestinal iron absorption and iron release from the reticuloendothelial system (eg, splenic macrophages).  In contrast, anemia of chronic disease is associated with very high levels of hepcidin (and other inflammatory cytokines), which reduces iron availability for erythrocytosis despite adequate total body stores of iron.  Patients with anemia of chronic disease typically have normocytic anemia and normochromia (not hypochromia). $#Educational objective# Patients with severe iron deficiency anemia (IDA) typically have evidence of hypochromic, microcytic erythrocytes on peripheral blood smear with poikilocytosis.  Laboratory studies will reveal low red blood cell count, low hepcidin, and high transferrin.

Coadministration of 6-MP with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor (eg, allopurinol, febuxostat) slows the inactivation of 6-MP and shunts metabolism toward the production of 6-TG active metabolites; therefore, the dose of 6-MP must be significantly reduced.  In addition, roughly 12% of the population has a genetic mutation resulting in low or absent activity of TPMT, creating a high risk of toxicity with the administration of 6-MP.

This pattern of findings is more consistent with α- or β-thalassemia, which usually cause microcytic anemia with normal ferritin and transferrin levels.  $ (Choice D)  Low hemoglobin in the setting of a normal MCV, low circulating transferrin, and high serum ferritin is suggestive of anemia of chronic disease, which is often associated with infections and inflammatory conditions.  Other acute phase reactants (eg, C-reactive protein, sedimentation rate) are usually elevated in these patients.  $ #(Choices E and F)#  @Hypersegmented neutrophils@ are characteristic of megaloblastic anemias, which can be caused by folate and vitamin B12 deficiency.  Folate deficiency is unlikely in this patient, as folate is found in many vegetable products.  Although vegetarians are at risk for vitamin B12 deficiency, depletion of hepatic B12 stores takes several years, and this patient has been a vegetarian only for the past 6 months. $ Educational objective Anemia in women of childbearing age is typically caused by iron deficiency secondary to menstrual blood loss.

However, ACD is also commonly caused by less obvious sources of inflammation such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, severe traumatic injury, and #morbid obesity#. $The major inflammatory cytokine that drives ACD is #hepcidin#, a small peptide released from the liver in response to inflammation or bacterial lipopolysaccharide.  Hepcidin binds to and #inhibits iron channels# (ferroportin) on the surface of enterocytes and reticuloendothelial macrophages, leading to decreased iron absorption in the gut and decreased iron release by the reticuloendothelial system (which supplies ~95% of daily iron for erythropoiesis).  Because heme synthesis is impaired without sufficient iron, patients with ACD typically develop a #normocytic# (or slightly microcytic) #anemia# with a #minimal reticulocyte response#. $#(Choice B)#  Extravascular hemolysis typically occurs due to the formation of IgG autoantibodies against the erythrocyte membrane, which results in erythrocyte destruction by splenic macrophages.

Patients typically have normocytic anemia, significant reticulocytosis, and severe thrombocytopenia (~10,000/mm3). $#(Choice D)#  Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) from an occult gastrointestinal bleed is common in older individuals.  IDA is also associated with a low reticulocyte count.  Although IDA can cause mild normocytic anemia early in the disease course, by the time individuals develop profound anemia (eg, hemoglobin of 8.6 mg/dL), they almost always have severe microcytosis (eg, MCV < 70).  This patient's severe anemia is accompanied by a normal MCV, making iron deficiency anemia highly unlikely. $#(Choice E)#  Vitamin B12 deficiency is associated with macrocytic (not normocytic) anemia due to impaired maturation of erythrocytes. $#Educational objective# Anemia of chronic disease (ACD) occurs in patients with rheumatologic diseases, chronic infection, malignancy, congestive heart failure, and morbid obesity due to chronic elevation of inflammatory cytokines.  The primary mediator is hepcidin, a peptide released from the liver that inhibits iron channels on enterocytes and reticuloendothelial macrophages.

As a result, patients with OSA may have up to 500 episodes of asphyxia per night. $ In adults, the main response to hypoxemia is coordinated by the #kidneys#.  In the renal cortex, peritubular fibroblasts sense hypoxia using the transcription factor #hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha# (HIF-1α).  When oxygen is readily available, @HIF-1α@ is marked for proteasomal degradation.  Under low oxygen conditions, intracellular levels of HIF-1α accumulate, substantially increasing erythropoietin (EPO) production. $ EPO is secreted into the bloodstream, acting on the bone marrow to accelerate @erythrocyte precursor@ maturation #(choice A)#.  The rapid rise in the number of mature erythrocytes leads to #secondary polycythemia# (eg, elevated hematocrit).  As a result, the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood rises, helping to compensate for chronic hypoxemia. $ (Choice B)  The brain does not regulate erythropoiesis in response to hypoxemia.  Instead, severe cerebral hypoxia drives increased sympathetic tone, increasing respiration, cerebral perfusion pressure, and oxygen delivery.  $(Choice C)  In response to hypoxemia, the liver helps supply iron (by suppressing hepcidin and upregulating transferrin) to support EPO-driven red blood cell production.

For this reason, patients with severe @chronic kidney disease@ (low EPO production), even when chronically hypoxemic, often have anemia and fail to develop secondary polycythemia.  $(Choice D)  With OSA, the lungs do not receive adequate oxygen delivery due to recurrent upper airway collapse.

Upon binding hepcidin, ferroportin is internalized and degraded, decreasing intestinal iron absorption and inhibiting the release of iron by macrophages. $Regulation of intestinal iron absorption is crucial for maintaining iron homeostasis, since blood loss is the only way of removing large amounts of iron from the body.  Iron absorption from the proximal small intestine is facilitated by the divalent metal transporter-1 (DMT-1).  Once inside the intestinal cells, iron may take 1 of 2 paths:  $1.

The bone marrow normally releases immature erythrocytes (reticulocytes) in response to severe anemia to compensate for lost oxygen-carrying capacity.

In contrast, an #inappropriately low reticulocyte count# (as in this case) suggests a problem with the production of red blood cells in the bone marrow, which may be caused by 1 of the following: $ • #Low erythropoietin# (EPO):  EPO is primarily produced in the cortical peritubular cells of the kidneys.  It travels to the bone marrow, where it stimulates the division and differentiation of erythroid progenitor cells.

CO poisoning can occur after exposure to automobile exhaust (especially in older cars without catalytic converters), fire smoke, or improperly vented natural gas appliances.  CO has 2 major effects on oxygen delivery to tissues:  $1. CO binds to hemoglobin with an affinity approximately 250 times that of oxygen, reducing the number of heme binding sites available to oxygen.  As a result, levels of CO-bound hemoglobin, represented by #carboxyhemoglobin# (HBCO), #increase#.  By decreasing the fraction of hemoglobin available for oxygen binding, CO decreases the oxygen-carrying capacity and #oxygen content# of blood, but #not# the amount of oxygen #dissolved# in plasma, reflected by the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2).  $2. CO poisoning causes a #leftward# shift of the hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve, reflecting a decreased tendency for oxygen to unload in the tissues. $CO's effects on arterial blood oxygen content are seen in the graphs below, which show the lower oxygen content with CO poisoning (similar to anemia) and the leftward shift of the dissociation curve that becomes increasingly more pronounced at increasingly higher HBCO concentrations (this does not occur with anemia).$  ","explanation_2":"$#(Choices A, B, C, and E)#  CO poisoning does not affect PaO2 and it does not cause methemoglobinemia.  Methemoglobin is formed when the Fe2+ (ferrous iron) in heme is oxidized to Fe3+ (ferric iron).  Methemoglobinemia results from drug exposures (ie, dapsone, nitrites) as well as enzyme deficiencies and hemoglobinopathies. $#Educational objective# Carbon monoxide (CO) binds to hemoglobin with much higher affinity than oxygen, thereby preventing oxygen binding to hemoglobin.  It also reduces oxygen unloading from hemoglobin in the tissues.  CO poisoning increases carboxyhemoglobin concentrations but does not affect the partial pressure of oxygen and does not precipitate methemoglobinemia.  "},

Both of these vitamins are required for DNA synthesis in erythropoiesis.  When there is a deficiency of either of these vitamins, cell division is delayed, though the cytoplasm develops normally.  Thus, the cells enlarge (megaloblasts) but do not divide.  The bone marrow is hypercellular in megaloblastic anemia, but the megaloblastic erythroid precursor cells are rapidly destroyed in the bone marrow and few differentiated large RBCs are released into the circulation.  In severe megaloblastic anemia, 90% of erythroid precursors are destroyed without ever entering the circulation. $ Vitamin B12 and folic acid deficiencies cause similar hematological pictures.  However, neurological dysfunction is only seen in patients with vitamin B12 deficiency.  This is because B12 deficiency also causes axonal demyelination and degeneration.  In late disease, the neurological dysfunction may be irreversible.  The main sites of neurological involvement include the peripheral nerves, spinal cord (posterior and lateral columns), and the cerebrum.  Decreased vibratory and position sense are early signs of vitamin B12 deficiency.  Patients experience ataxia and recurrent falls because of compromised proprioception.  Importantly, neurologic abnormalities can occur in vitamin B12 deficiency in the absence of frank anemia.  Treating megaloblastic anemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency with folate alone could worsen the neurological dysfunction. $ An RBC mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of more than 100 fL is suggestive of megaloblastic anemia.  However, RBC macrocytosis can also occur in liver disease, hypothyroidism, and alcohol-induced liver disease.  MCVs greater than 110 fL are typically seen only with vitamin B12 and folic acid anemias.  On peripheral blood smear, there is macrocytosis (large RBCs), hypersegmented neutrophils, and large bizarrely shaped platelets.

SLE frequently causes anemia due to a combination of factors, including chronic inflammation (anemia of chronic disease), gastrointestinal serositis (iron deficiency from bleeding), and/or #autoimmune hemolytic anemia# (AIHA). $ Approximately 10% of patients with SLE develop AIHA due to immune dysregulation, which results in the formation of #IgG autoantibodies# against the erythrocyte membrane.

Pancytopenia is caused by hematopoietic stem cell dysfunction, bone marrow infiltration, or peripheral destruction of mature blood cells.  Important clues in this case include: $• #Low reticulocyte count:#  Patients with severe anemia usually have increased reticulocytes due to enhanced bone marrow erythropoiesis.  The presence of pancytopenia with an #inappropriately low# reticulocyte count usually indicates the #bone marrow is impaired# and is unable to adequately generate new cells despite strong growth signals (eg, increased erythropoietin). $• #Macrocytosis:#  Although macrocytosis can be seen in a wide range of pathologies, the presence of pancytopenia plus macrocytosis usually indicates a vitamin deficiency (eg, vitamin B12, folate) or a medication (eg, hydroxyurea) is #impairing DNA synthesis# in hematopoietic cells. $#Hydroxyurea #inhibits #ribonucleoside reductase#, an enzyme that generates deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates for #DNA synthesis/repair#.  A lack of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates slows erythrocyte nuclear development, leading to decreased cellular division with an overall increase in erythrocyte size.  High doses of hydroxyurea also impair nuclear development in precursors of leukocytes and thrombocytes, leading to pancytopenia. $Hydroxyurea is the major disease-modifying medication in SCD; it reduces production of the mutated beta globulin gene and increases production of the fetal hemoglobin gene, which increases fetal hemoglobin (HbF).  Because HbF functions normally, erythrocytes with increased HbF are less likely to sickle in the microvasculature. $#(Choice A)#  Autoimmune hemolytic anemia is associated with high (not low) reticulocytes due to increased erythropoiesis.  Because reticulocytes are larger (MCV 125-135 µm3) than mature erythrocytes, reticulocytosis can cause macrocytosis; however, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia would not be seen. $#(Choice B)#  Folate is a methyl group donor for the synthesis of purines and pyrimidines.

This results in the alteration of a hydrophobic portion of the β globin chain that fits into a complementary site on the α globin chain of another hemoglobin molecule.  As a result, hemoglobin molecules aggregate under anoxic conditions.  After polymerization, HbS initially forms a gel and then a meshwork of fibrous polymers causing the red blood cells to distort into an abnormal sickle shape. $#Sickling# is promoted by conditions associated with #low oxygen# levels, increased acidity, or low blood volume (dehydration).  Sickled cells are not flexible enough to pass through microvasculature.  As a result, they impede blood flow and cause microinfarcts in tissues and painful vasoocclusive crises.  Organs in which blood moves slowly (eg, spleen, liver) are predisposed to lower oxygen levels or acidity.  Organs with particularly high metabolic demands (eg, brain, muscles, placenta) promote sickling by extracting more oxygen from the blood (#oxygen unloading#).  The sickling process is complex and incompletely understood. $#(Choices A and C)#  The molecule 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) binds the 2 β globin chains ionically and stabilizes the taut (T) deoxyhemoglobin.  This binding decreases hemoglobin's oxygen affinity, facilitating oxygen release at the tissue level.  With 2,3-BPG depletion, hemoglobin affinity for oxygen increases (left shift on @oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve@), and this results in oxygen uptake by hemoglobin; therefore, erythrocyte sickling will decrease.  Similarly, increased acidity or low pH is associated with sickling, so decreased acidity with elevated capillary pH values >7.4 would not promote sickling. $#(Choice B)#  The globin chains in the hemoglobin tetramer are folded compactly, with nonpolar hydrophobic residues in the interior and charged polar residues on the surface.  A valine for glutamic acid substitution does not result in a significant change in β globin folding.  It is the mature hemoglobin tetramer that undergoes polymerization, not individual globin chains during folding. $#(Choice D)#  HbS does not polymerize when fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is present, so patients with sickle cell anemia often do not have symptoms until the HbF fraction decreases a few months after delivery.  Some patients with HbS may have fewer clinical manifestations because they produce larger amounts of HbF as adults. $#Educational objective# Hemoglobin S (HbS) aggregates in the deoxygenated state.  HbS polymers form fibrous strands that reduce red blood cell membrane flexibility and promote sickling.  Sickling occurs under conditions associated with anoxia including low pH and high levels of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate.

The presence of a normal MCV makes vitamin B12 or folate deficiency unlikely because these are associated with macrocytic (not normocytic) anemia #(choice E)#.  Hypersplenism is also unlikely because abdominal examination would show significant splenomegaly #(choice C)#.  Chronic myelogenous leukemia, an infiltrative cancer associated with constitutively active tyrosine kinase, is also unlikely because this condition is usually associated with dramatic leukocytosis (not leukopenia) #(choice B)#. $ Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's pancytopenia is #aplastic anemia# (AA).  Although AA is linked to certain medications, infections, toxins, or radiation, most cases are #idiopathic# and thought to be caused by #autoimmune-induced loss of multipotent hematologic stem cells#.  In idiopathic AA, an underlying insult (eg, mutation, virus) causes alteration of surface antigens on multipotent stem cells, making them appear foreign and triggering a #cytotoxic T-cell response#.  Cytokines released by T-helper cells (type 1 cytokines) also contribute to the pathogenesis, most notably #interferon-gamma#, which triggers #apoptotic cell death# due to the stimulation of a destructive cytokine cascade and the increased expression of the Fas receptor on the hematologic stem cell surface. $ (Choice D)  Autoantibodies against glycoprotein IIb/IIIa cause immune thrombocytopenia, which is marked by thrombocytopenia and no change in the other cell lines. $ Educational objective Aplastic anemia is a form of bone marrow failure in which patients have decreased production of all cell lines (platelets, erythrocytes, and leukocytes).  It is primarily caused by the autoimmune destruction of multipotent hematologic stem cells due to an alteration in their surface antigens, leading to a cytotoxic T-cell response and release of interferon-gamma from T-helper cells (triggers apoptotic cell death)."}
