    "explanation_2": "The nasal mucosa is highly vascular and easily irritated by trauma (eg, nose-picking), mucosal dryness, foreign body insertion, and rhinitis (eg, allergy, infection). #Epistaxis# is very common in children and may be classified as anterior or posterior, depending on the bleeding source. Anterior nosebleeds are by far the most common, and the vast majority occur within the vascular watershed area of the #nasal septum# (anteroinferior part of the nasal septal mucosa) known as #Kiesselbach plexus#. Anastomosis of the following vessels occurs in this region: $• Septal branch of the #anterior ethmoidal artery# $• Lateral nasal branch of the #sphenopalatine artery# $• Septal branch of the #superior labial artery# (branch of the facial artery) Management is directed at stopping the bleeding from Kiesselbach plexus, preferably by direct @compression of the nasal alae@. Cautery (eg, silver nitrate) of the area surrounding the bleeding site may be necessary for persistent bleeding. $#(Choices A and B)# The @lateral nasal wall@ contains the superior, middle, and inferior turbinates (also known as conchae). These 3 bony projections are covered with mucous membrane; they warm, humidify, and filter inspired air and expand and contract in response to environmental changes (eg, temperature, humidity, allergens). The turbinates form corresponding meatuses that serve as drainage pathways. The superior meatus provides drainage for the sphenoidal and posterior ethmoidal sinuses. The middle meatus drains the frontal, maxillary, and anterior ethmoidal sinuses and is the most common site of nasal polyps. The inferior meatus drains the nasolacrimal duct. $#(Choices D and E)# Branches of the sphenopalatine artery supply the posterolateral wall and posterior choanae. These posterolateral branches are the most likely source of posterior nosebleeds. Posterior epistaxis is usually severe and cannot be treated with cautery. $Educational objective Epistaxis is commonly caused by irritation of the highly vascular mucosa at the anterior nasal septum. The anterior nasal septum contains the Kiesselbach plexus. The anterior ethmoidal, sphenopalatine, and superior labial arteries anastomose in this region.",

    "explanation_2": "This patient has high-frequency hearing loss due to chronic noise exposure. Transduction of mechanical sound waves into nerve impulses occurs in the #organ of Corti# through the following steps: 1. Sound reaches the middle ear by vibrating the tympanic membrane. 2. The vibration is transferred to the oval window by the ossicles. 3. Vibration of the oval window causes vibration of the basilar membrane, which in turn causes bending of the hair cell cilia against the tectorial membrane. 4. Hair cell bending causes oscillating hyperpolarization and depolarization of the auditory nerve, thereby creating nerve impulses from sound. #Noise-induced hearing loss# results from trauma to the #stereociliated hair cells# of the organ of Corti. The acoustic reflex normally dampens the effects of loud noise by causing the stapedius and tensor tympani muscles to contract, which lessens the responsiveness of the ossicles to sound. However, prolonged noise exposure can cause distortion or fracture of the stereocilia due to shearing forces against the tectorial membrane. High-frequency hearing is lost first, regardless of the frequency of the sound causing the damage. $(Choice A) Hearing loss originating in the auditory nerve is most commonly due to a vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma). Patients develop high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss, but symptoms are usually unilateral. $(Choice B) The cochlear cupula is the apex of the cochlea and is distant from the oval window. The distal cochlea primarily registers low-frequency sound. $(Choice C) Defects of the middle ear ossicles (eg, otosclerosis) can cause hearing loss that generally affects air conduction across all frequencies. This patient's hearing loss affects both air and bone conduction. $(Choice E) The round window lies between the middle and inner ear and moves outward when the stapes causes the oval window to move inward. Malformation of the round window can cause congenital hearing impairment, but acquired disorders are rare. $(Choice F) Perforation or rupture of the tympanic membrane can occur with infection, trauma, pressure changes, or sudden and very loud noises. Rupture of the tympanic membrane causes unilateral conductive hearing loss. $Educational objective Prolonged exposure to loud noises causes hearing loss due to damage to the stereociliated hair cells of the organ of Corti."

    "explanation_2": "This patient has an anterior dislocation of the #temporomandibular joint# (TMJ), the synovial joint that opens and closes the jaw. The joint is formed by the mandibular condyle that sits in the glenoid fossa of the squamous portion of the temporal bone. TMJ opening involves a complex movement that has both hinge and sliding components: $• The initial movement is rotational (ie, hinge) and driven by the #lateral pterygoid muscles#, which are the only muscles of mastication that aid in #depressing the mandible# (ie, opening the jaw). $• As the jaw opens, the ligaments become taut, stopping further rotation. $• Further action by the lateral pterygoids results in translational movement (ie, condyle slides anteriorly) that opens the jaw fully. TMJ dislocation occurs when translational movement is exaggerated due to #extreme jaw opening# (eg, yawning, orotracheal intubation, #seizure#) that causes displacement of the condyle anteriorly out of the glenoid fossa. Stretching of the ligaments causes significant pain and spasm of the muscles of mastication. This #muscle spasm# (specifically of the lateral pterygoids that aid jaw opening) #prevents spontaneous resolution# of the dislocation; manual reduction is usually necessary. $(Choice A) The buccinator muscle underlies the cheek. It holds the cheek close to the teeth to control food boluses during chewing but is not involved in movement of the jaw. $(Choice B) The genioglossus muscles form the body of the tongue. Although they originate on the tubercle of the mandible (and insert into the hyoid bone and the bottom of the tongue), they are responsible for tongue protrusion rather than mandibular movement. $(Choice D) The sternocleidomastoid muscles originate at the sternum and the clavicle and insert on the mastoid tip. They rotate the head (when acting independently) or flex the neck (when acting in concert). $(Choice E) The superior pharyngeal constrictor forms portions of the posterior and lateral oropharyngeal walls. Muscle contraction propels food and liquid inferiorly into the esophagus during swallowing. $(Choice F) The @zygomaticus major@ originates from the zygomatic bone and inserts onto the angle of the mouth. Contraction pulls the angle of the mouth laterally and superiorly during a smile. $Educational objective The lateral pterygoid muscles are the only muscles of mastication that aid in depressing the mandible (ie, opening the jaw). Spasm of the lateral pterygoids prevents spontaneous reduction of an anterior dislocation of the temporomandibular joint.",

    "explanation_2": "This patient has #otalgia# in the setting of a normal ear examination, which is likely #referred pain# (pain perceived at a different site than its true origin). Further evaluation shows an ulcerative mass in the hypopharynx with an enlarged lymph node, which is consistent with #mucosal head and neck squamous cell carcinoma# (HNSCC). Many sources of pain in the head and neck can be referred to the ear because several cranial nerves also innervate parts of the @ear@. Common causes of referred ear pain include temporomandibular joint disease, dental disease, or cancer affecting the tongue base, hypopharynx, or larynx. This patient's referred otalgia is most likely due to his hypopharyngeal carcinoma causing irritation of the #vagus nerve# (CN X). The vagus nerve has afferent fibers innervating the larynx and #hypopharynx# and also has a branch that provides afferent sensory input from the external auditory canal. Similarly, the #glossopharyngeal nerve# (CN IX), which innervates the upper pharynx and base of tongue, also provides sensory innervation to the external auditory canal and can contribute to referred otalgia from tumors in these areas. $#(Choices A, B, and F)# The trigeminal nerve (CN V) provides sensory innervation for much of the face, including parts of the ear. The facial nerve (CN VII) and great auricular nerve (originates from C2 and C3) innervate portions of the external auditory canal. Although these nerves carry sensation from the ear, they do not provide innervation to the hypopharynx. $(Choice C) The vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII) contributes special sensory (hearing, balance) from the ear but does not contribute to general sensation. Therefore, lesions that impact the vestibulocochlear nerve tend to cause hearing loss or imbalance (eg, vertigo) rather than pain. $(Choice E) The hypoglossal nerve (CN XII) innervates the muscles of the tongue. It has motor function only, so dysfunction tends to produce weakness (eg, deviation of the tongue) rather than pain. $Educational objective Referred otalgia is common in head and neck pathology because many cranial nerves innervate the ear (eg, CN V, VII, IX, X). In particular, tumors in the hypopharynx, larynx, or base of tongue cause referred otalgia due to sensory contributions from the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves.",

    "explanation_2": "This patient's presentation is most consistent with #temporomandibular joint disorder# (TMD). The underlying etiology of TMD is multifactorial and includes temporomandibular joint derangement (eg, jaw misalignment, jaw clenching/teeth grinding, trauma) and hypersensitivity of the mandibular nerve (CN V3). In addition to the classic symptoms of dull, waxing-and-waning face/jaw pain (worse with chewing) and clicking/popping noises with jaw movement, TMD can also present with ear-related symptoms (eg, ear pain, ear stuffiness, tinnitus). Many of these clinical findings are due to involvement of the #mandibular nerve# (CN V3), which is the largest branch of the #trigeminal nerve#. It supplies sensation to the temporomandibular joint, floor of mouth, anterior tongue, and lower part of the face. In addition, it contributes to the sensory innervation of the #external auditory canal#; therefore, TMD can present with #ear pain# that is #referred# from the jaw joint. Ear stuffiness may be related to hypersensitivity affecting the tensor tympani. Theories regarding tinnitus in TMD include the proximity of the muscles of mastication to the ear and central connections between nerve supply of the temporomandibular joint and the areas of the brain involved in hearing. $(Choice A) The sensory component of the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) carries general sensory information from the tonsils, pharynx, middle ear, and posterior third of the tongue; special sensory information (taste) from the posterior third of the tongue; and visceral sensory information from the carotid bodies and carotid sinus. $(Choice B) The hypoglossal nerve (CN XII) carries general motor efferent information to the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the tongue. $(Choice D) The auricular branch of the vagus nerve (CN X) conveys sensory information from the external auditory canal but is not thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of TMD. $(Choice E) The vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII) carries only special sensory information (auditory and balance) from the inner ear. $Educational objective Temporomandibular joint disorder is associated with derangement of the temporomandibular joint and hypersensitivity of the mandibular nerve (CN V3)."

An enlarged, firm cervical lymph node is often the presenting symptom of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Identification of the primary site of tumor formation is important for staging and to guide treatment strategies. This patient's #unilateral middle ear effusion# suggests #obstruction# of the #eustachian tube#, which connects the middle ear space to the nasopharynx. It opens intermittently, typically during swallowing or yawning to equalize pressure in the middle ear. Failure to adequately open causes negative pressure to build within the middle ear, leading to a transudative effusion (clear, amber, or yellow). Eustachian tube dysfunction can be due to anatomic obstruction from a #mass in the nasopharynx# or, more commonly, due to functional obstruction from infections, allergic rhinitis, or irritants (eg, tobacco smoke). $#(Choices A, D, and F)# HNSCC can originate from the mucosa of other anatomic sites. Many sites (eg, base of tongue, piriform sinus) initially cause only vague or minor symptoms, but some may present with more specific features (eg, hoarseness in vocal cord cancer). Cancer at any of these other sites (ie, base of tongue, piriform sinus, vocal cord) would not lead to obstruction of the eustachian tube with a resultant middle ear effusion. $(Choice C) Cancer of the parotid gland may spread to the cervical lymph nodes. The superior portion of the parotid gland is near the external auditory canal of the ear, not the eustachian tube. In addition, because the parotid gland is near the skin surface, primary tumors of the parotid are typically palpable. $(Choice E) Cancer of the thyroid gland may spread to the cervical lymph nodes. However, it is very rare to have squamous cell carcinoma in the thyroid, and enlargement of the thyroid gland would not block the eustachian tube. $Educational objective The eustachian tube connects the middle ear to the nasopharynx. Cancer located in the nasopharynx can lead to obstruction of the eustachian tube, causing a middle ear effusion."

Children with cleft palate often have #recurrent otitis media# due to #eustachian tube dysfunction#.  The muscles primarily responsible for opening the eustachian tube include the #tensor veli palatini# and the levator veli palatini. $The #levator veli palatini# arises from the petrous portion of the temporal bone and medial part of the eustachian tube.  Its fibers insert into the superior portion of the palatine aponeurosis (soft palate) and interdigitate in the midline with the contralateral muscle fibers.  It #elevates the soft palate# during swallowing to prevent food from refluxing into the nasopharynx; contraction also #opens the eustachian tube#.  With cleft palate, levator veli palatini insertion is no longer stable, so contraction does not lead to force on the eustachian tube. $#(Choice A)#  The @lateral pterygoid@ muscles depress the mandible (ie, open the jaw).  They are not impacted in cleft lip or palate. $#(Choice C)#  The @orbicularis oris@ encircles the mouth, acting as a sphincter to close the mouth and pucker the lips.  In cleft lip, it does not form a complete circle, but inserts into the base of the nose on either side of the cleft; however, it does not impact the function of the eustachian tube. $#(Choice D)#  The @stapedius muscle@ is innervated by the facial nerve (CN VII).  It arises from the wall of the tympanic cavity and inserts on the neck of the stapes bone.  It functions to stabilize the stapes.  Contraction causes dampening of sound transmission in response to loud noises.  It does not open the eustachian tube. $#(Choice E)#  The superior pharyngeal constrictor forms portions of the posterior and lateral oropharyngeal walls.  Contraction propels food and liquid inferiorly into the esophagus during swallowing.  Together with the levator veli palatini, it elevates the palate to seal the nasal cavity during swallowing.  Although both functions are impaired in cleft palate, the superior pharyngeal constrictor does not play a direct role in opening the eustachian tube. $#Educational objective# Patients with cleft palate are at increased risk of chronic or recurrent acute otitis media, partly because of dysfunction of the muscles (eg, levator veli palatini) that contract against the soft palate to open the eustachian tube.

The cavernous nerves carry post-ganglionic parasympathetic fibers that facilitate penile erection. #Prostatectomy# or injury to the prostatic plexus can cause #erectile dysfunction#; as a result, surgeons attempt to preserve the integrity of the prostatic fascial shell during surgery.\n\n$(Choice A) Detrusor muscle overactivity leads to urge incontinence, which is more common in women. The detrusor muscle is controlled by parasympathetic fibers from the pelvic splanchnic nerves and inferior hypogastric plexus, which are not usually injured during prostatectomy.\n\n$#(Choices C, D, and F)# Branches of the pudendal nerve innervate the external urethral and anal sphincters. They also provide sensory innervation of the external genitalia. Pudendal nerve injury can lead to fecal incontinence, decreased penile sensation, or external urethral sphincter paralysis. Although urethral muscle injury can occur during prostate surgery, injury to the main pudendal nerve is less common with prostatectomy.\n\n$(Choice E) The cremasteric reflex is elicited by lightly stroking the medial thigh, which causes contraction of the cremaster muscle to pull up the ipsilateral testis. This reflex is mediated by the genitofemoral nerve, which originates from the L1-L2 spinal nerves. Loss of the cremasteric reflex is most commonly seen with testicular torsion or L1-L2 spinal injury.\n\n$Educational objective\nThe prostatic plexus (inferior hypogastric nerves plus pelvic and sacral splanchnic nerves) lies within the fascia of the prostate and innervates the corpus cavernosa of the penis, which facilitates penile erection.

After crossing anteriorly over the ureter, the gonadal arteries run parallel to the external iliac vessels and eventually traverse the inguinal canal to supply the testes via the spermatic cord in males.\n\nThis patient most likely has @testicular torsion@, which is usually due to inadequate fixation of the lower pole of the testis to the tunica vaginalis. Testicular torsion is caused by twisting of the spermatic cord, resulting in compression of the pampiniform plexus of the testicular vein and reduced venous outflow.

The testes subsequently descend through the inguinal canals into the scrotum, taking with them their arterial, venous, and lymphatic supplies. Thus, lymph from the testes drains through lymph channels directly back to the para-aortic lymph nodes.\n\n$(Choice A) The superficial inguinal lymph nodes are located on the anterior thigh inferior to the inguinal ligament. These nodes drain nearly all cutaneous structures inferior to the umbilicus, including the external genitalia and the anus up to the pectinate line.\n\n$(Choice B) The deep inguinal nodes reside under the fascia lata on the medial side of the femoral vein. They receive afferents from the superficial inguinal nodes and deep lymphatic trunks along the femoral vessels.

A common cause is #uterine atony# (failure of the uterus to contract and compress the placental site vessels), as evidenced by a #boggy uterus#. Surgery is indicated when medical management (eg, uterotonic medications) cannot control uterine bleeding.\nThe main blood supply to the uterus is the uterine artery, a branch of the anterior division of the internal iliac artery. However, there are robust collaterals (eg, vaginal, ovarian) to the uterus during pregnancy such that in cases of severe PPH, ligation (tying off with suture) of the uterine arteries may fail to control the bleeding. In these cases, #bilateral ligation# of the #internal iliac artery# (also known as the hypogastric artery), the main blood supply to the pelvis, is performed to decrease flow rate and pulse pressure within all pelvic vessels, which can #stop uterine bleeding# and avoid hysterectomy.\nThe structures supplied by the internal iliac arteries are typically unharmed by the procedure due to anastomoses with branches of the external iliac artery (eg, medial femoral circumflex-obturator anastomosis) or eventual recanalization. Therefore, in women of childbearing age, fertility is preserved and complication rates (eg, buttock claudication) are low.\n$#(Choices A and B)# The aorta bifurcates into the common iliac arteries, which bifurcate into the internal and external iliac arteries.

Because the internal pudendal artery is distal to the uterine artery on the internal iliac, ligation would not decrease uterine blood flow.\n$(Choice E) The ovarian artery, which originates from the abdominal aorta, supplies primarily the ovary and secondarily the uterus. Although bilateral ligation could somewhat decrease uterine blood flow, it would also cause irreversible ovarian necrosis, infertility, and menopause.\n$Educational objective\nThe internal iliac artery (hypogastric artery) supplies blood to the pelvis, including the uterus via the uterine artery.

    "explanation_2": "This patient's right-sided pelvic pain is consistent with #ovarian torsion#. Ovarian torsion is commonly precipitated by physical activity, and patients with complete torsion typically develop sudden onset, severe, unilateral lower abdominal pain with nausea/vomiting.\nOvarian torsion occurs because the ovary is loosely suspended posterolaterally to the uterus by the uteroovarian ligament and to the pelvic sidewall by the #infundibulopelvic (IP) ligament#(also known as the suspensory ligament of the ovary). The main risk factor for torsion is a large #ovarian mass# because weight of the mass causes the ovary to #twist# around the IP ligament, thereby #occluding the ovarian vessels# that run within the ligament. The @torsed ovary@ then becomes edematous and ischemic due to lack of blood flow to the ovary. Diagnosis is clinical but pelvic ultrasound may help in evaluation.\n$(Choice A) The cardinal ligaments arise from the lateral pelvic sidewalls and attach to the cervix, vagina, and uterosacral ligaments to provide pelvic organ support. They are not in close proximity to the ovaries and are not involved in torsion.\n$(Choice C) The @broad ligament@ is a wide sheet of peritoneum that encapsulates the reproductive organs, attaching the uterus to the walls and floor of the pelvis; the mesosalpinx is the portion of the broad ligament that connects to the fallopian tubes (ie, the mesentery of the fallopian tubes).\n$(Choice D) The round ligament maintains the anteflexion of the uterus. It runs from the cornu of the uterus through the inguinal ring to the labia majora and is not connected to the ovaries. During pregnancy, a woman may experience intermittent, sharp pain due to the stretching round ligament.\n$(Choice E) The uterosacral ligaments connect the posterior aspect of the uterus to the anterior portion of the sacrum. These ligaments hold the uterus in position; loss of this support contributes to uterine prolapse into the vagina. They are not involved in the positioning or vascular supply of the ovaries.\n$Educational objective\nOvarian torsion typically involves twisting of the infundibulopelvic ligament, often due to the weight of a large adnexal mass. The resulting occlusion of the blood supply to the ovary results in severe, acute pelvic pain and ovarian ischemia.",

In adolescents with #normal secondary sexual characteristics# (which suggest intact hormonal function) and #cyclic abdominopelvic pain# (which suggests menstruation), the most likely cause is genital tract #outflow obstruction# (eg, imperforate hymen). $An #imperforate hymen# occurs due to incomplete degeneration of the hymen prior to birth.  At menarche, blood accumulates behind the hymen, and the expanding collection with each menstrual period causes increasing pressure on the pelvic organs (eg, defecatory/urinary dysfunction) and worsening abdominopelvic pain with no apparent menstrual bleeding.  As a result of pooled blood behind the hymen, physical examination typically reveals a smooth @vaginal bulge@ (#hematocolpos#) and a #palpable mass anterior to the rectum# (ie, the distended vagina).  Treatment is with hymenal incision and drainage, which resolves the obstruction and amenorrhea. $#(Choice A)#  @Androgen insensitivity syndrome@ causes primary amenorrhea due to the lack of müllerian structures.  Patients are 46,XY males but appear phenotypically female (ie, no external male genitalia) due to an androgen receptor defect.  These patients have normal breast development due to peripheral aromatization of testosterone to estrogen and may have palpable prostate tissue (eg, mass anterior to the rectum).  However, unlike this patient, they usually have minimal axillary or pubic hair due to androgen resistance. $#(Choice B)#  @Asherman syndrome@, the development of intrauterine adhesions, can obstruct uterine outflow and cause abdominopelvic pain and amenorrhea (typically secondary amenorrhea).  However, patients usually have a history of uterine infection or intrauterine surgery (eg, dilation and curettage), and there is no association with a palpable mass on digital rectal examination. $#(Choice C)#  @Endometriosis@, the ectopic implantation of endometrium outside the uterus, can cause worsening, cyclic abdominopelvic pain and rectovaginal nodularity (eg, endometrial implants in the pouch of Douglas) that may be palpable on digital rectal examination.  However, endometriosis is not associated with amenorrhea. $#(Choice E)#  @Kallmann syndrome@ can present with primary amenorrhea due to the impaired synthesis of gonadotropin-releasing hormone in the hypothalamus; therefore, in contrast to this patient with normal secondary sexual characteristics, those with Kallmann syndrome typically have no secondary sexual characteristics. $#Educational objective# Adolescent girls with primary amenorrhea, normal secondary sexual characteristics, and progressively worsening abdominopelvic pain may have an imperforate hymen.

The levator ani muscle complex forms most of the pelvic floor and functions to hold the pelvic organs in a stable position; when this complex is damaged, such as with increased intraabdominal pressure (eg, #pregnancy#, obesity) or obstetric trauma (eg, forceps-assisted vaginal delivery), there is increased pelvic floor laxity, resulting in decreased pelvic organ support. $The decreased pelvic floor support causes an anatomic change to normal pelvic organ positions; for the rectum, this leads to a change in rectal angle during defecation, which can cause incomplete defecation and #constipation#.

The most common sites of ureteral injury during hysterectomy include the following:\n• Where the ureter enters the pelvis at the pelvic brim, posterior to the #infundibulopelvic ligament# (which contains the ovarian vessels)\n• Along the pelvic sidewall as the ureter runs along the lateral aspect of the #uterosacral ligament#\n• In the #cardinal ligament# (which contains the uterine vessels) as the ureter dives under the uterine artery (\"water under the bridge\")\n• Along the anterolateral cervix and vaginal fornix as the ureter enters the bladder\nHysterectomy requires suture ligation and transection of the main uterine blood supply, the uterine artery within the cardinal ligament. Large fibroids at the level of the cardinal ligament (as in this patient) can distort uterine anatomy, thereby increasing the risk of #accidentally suturing the ureter# and causing ureteral obstruction during a hysterectomy.\nA unilateral #ureteral obstruction# causes urine to accumulate proximally, leading to distension and dilation of the proximal ureter and kidney (ie, #hydronephrosis#) and #back pain#. Most patients with unilateral obstruction maintain #normal urinary function# and have a normal serum creatinine level because the contralateral kidney and ureter function normally and compensate for the affected kidney.\n$(Choice A) The bladder can be injured during hysterectomy during its separation from the lower aspect of the uterus and cervix. However, bladder injuries typically present with abdominal pain/distension due to accumulation of urine within the abdomen.\n$#(Choices B, C, and E)# Injury to the external iliac, ovarian, or uterine artery would not present with isolated back pain. Instead, an undiagnosed arterial injury would likely present postoperatively with an acute abdomen (due to hemoperitoneum) and hemodynamic instability (eg, hypotension).\n$Educational objective\nThe ureter can be injured during pelvic surgery due to its proximity to major pelvic ligaments and vessels such as the uterine artery within the cardinal ligament.

Left CN III palsy with contralateral arm and leg weakness (corticospinal tract) is most likely caused by a left midbrain infarction due to occlusion of the mesencephalic branches of the posterior cerebral artery (ie, #Weber syndrome#).  This can develop from obstruction of perforating arteries of the basilar bifurcation. $#(Choice A)#  A stroke in the cerebral cortex can lead to weakness with upper motor neuron (UMN) signs.  However, it is often accompanied by cortical signs (ie, deficits localizing to the cortex) that may include #V#isual disturbances (eg, hemianopia, gaze preference), #A#phasia (ie, typically expressive Broca), #N#eglect, and cortical #S#ensory deficits (eg, inability to recognize movement drawn on the palm) (ie, #VANS# stroke scale).  Cranial nerve deficits would not be expected. $#(Choice B)#  A stroke in the internal capsule leads to contralateral hemiparesis.  Because it is such a small anatomic area, in addition to the arm and leg, there is also usually facial weakness sparing the upper face (UMN-type weakness).  Cranial nerve deficits are more consistent with a brainstem stroke. $#(Choice D)#  Pontine infarctions can cause ipsilateral cranial nerve deficits with contralateral hemiparesis.  However, the involved @cranial nerves@ originate in the pons:  Trigeminal (CN V) (facial paresthesia), abducent (CN VI) (abducens palsy), facial (CN VII) (facial palsy), and vestibulocochlear (CN VIII) (vertigo).  A pontine infarction would not likely cause CN III deficits. $#(Choice E)#  Medullary infarctions can cause ipsilateral cranial nerve deficits with contralateral hemiparesis.  However, the involved cranial nerves originate in the medulla:  Glossopharyngeal (CN IX) (diminished gag, palate weakness), vagus (CN X) (dysphonia), and hypoglossal (CN XII) (tongue weakness).  Medullary infarctions often result in well-known clinical stroke syndromes (eg, @lateral medullary syndrome@, @medial medullary syndrome@). $#Educational objective# Crossed signs (ie, cranial nerve dysfunction with contralateral limb weakness) raise suspicion for brainstem stroke.

Beyond the splenic flexure, it is controlled by #parasympathetic innervation# from the #S2-S4# nerve roots.$The innervation of the anal sphincter is complex and under voluntary, parasympathetic, and sympathetic control; therefore, #fecal incontinence# can occur due to lesions at multiple levels of the nervous system (eg, frontal cortex, spinal cord, peripheral nerves). The anal sphincter consists of an:$• #External sphincter#, which includes #skeletal muscle# and is under voluntary control innervated by the pudendal nerve (#S2-S4# branches)$• Internal sphincter, which includes smooth muscle that is contiguous with the rectum. Sympathetic innervation normally maintains it in a state of tonic contraction.

However, distal colon stool retention is more likely related to impaired parasympathetic activity of the S2-S4 nerve roots. Also, vagal injury would not affect anal sphincter tone.$Educational objective Sacral spinal cord injury can lead to lower motor neuron injury of the S2-S4 nerve rootlets; these contribute parasympathetic innervation to the distal colon to stimulate peristalsis and voluntary motor innervation to the external anal sphincter. Lesions in this area can lead to distal colon stool retention, fecal incontinence, and a weak external anal sphincter."

It follows a superficial course through the posterior triangle of the neck and is vulnerable to penetrating trauma and #iatrogenic injury# (eg, cervical lymph node dissection). $The @trapezius@ elevates and rotates the scapula upward (eg, during arm abduction) and stabilizes the shoulder.  Symptoms of trapezius weakness include #drooping of the shoulder#, impaired abduction of the arm #above 100 degrees#, and lateral displacement of the scapula.  If the injury involves the proximal portions of the nerve, weakness of the sternocleidomastoid may also occur. $#(Choice A)#  The deltoid is innervated by the axillary nerve (C5-6).  Injury would cause impaired sensation over the lateral shoulder and weakness in abduction of the arm from 30 to 100 degrees.  Iatrogenic axillary nerve injury can occur during shoulder surgery (eg, proximal humerus fracture repair) or intramuscular injection in the deltoid. $#(Choice B)#  The latissimus dorsi is innervated by the thoracodorsal nerve which can be damaged during axillary lymph node dissection.  It is the most powerful adductor of the arm and assists with extension and medial rotation. $#(Choice C)#  The levator scapulae is innervated by the C3 and C4 cervical nerves and the dorsal scapular nerve (C5).  It acts to elevate the scapula and rotate its medial border inferiorly but does not have a significant effect on arm abduction. $#(Choice D)#  The serratus anterior is innervated by the long thoracic nerve and protracts and rotates the scapula upward, assisting with elevation of the arm over the head.  Although weakness of the serratus anterior causes winging of the scapula, it usually occurs following axillary lymph node dissection and would not be associated with shoulder droop. $#Educational objective# The spinal accessory nerve is vulnerable to injury in the posterior triangle of the neck.  Injury results in weakness of the trapezius muscle, which presents with drooping of the shoulder, impaired abduction of the arm above 100 degrees, and lateral displacement of the scapula.  ",

The sciatic nerve is particularly susceptible to injury in patients with femoral head dislocation, hip fracture, and/or arthroplasty due to its #proximity to the hip joint# and femur.

In this case, the patient's symptoms are most likely due to occlusion of a branch of the retinal artery as a complication of his recent coronary catheterization procedure. $#(Choice A)#  A lesion in the left occipital lobe would impact the primary visual cortex.  Because of the crossing fibers in the optic chiasm, the left occipital cortex receives information from the right visual fields of both eyes.  A lesion in this area would result in right homonymous hemianopia (classically with macular sparing due to collaterals from the middle cerebral artery). $#(Choices B and C)#  After synapsing in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), the optic radiations fan out and project to the occipital lobe.  The inferior optic radiations, which carry information from the inferior retina/superior visual field, travel through the temporal lobe white matter.  Lesions in this area would lead to superior quadrant visual field defects (ie, contralateral homonymous superior quadrantanopia).  The superior optic radiations, which carry information from the superior retina/inferior visual field, travel through the parietal lobe white matter; lesions here lead to contralateral lower quadrantanopia. $#(Choice E)#  After the axons of the retinal ganglion cells travel through the optic chiasm, they synapse in the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus.  Therefore, a lesion in the right LGN would lead to left-sided visual loss (eg, left homonymous hemianopia). $#(Choice F)#  Because the image projected on the retina is inverted and reversed, a lesion of the upper right retina would lead to a monocular lower left visual field defect. $#Educational objective# Visual loss in only one eye indicates that the lesion is anterior to the optic chiasm.  Images projected onto the retina are inverted and reversed.  ",

In addition, because CN III provides motor innervation to most of the extraocular muscles, dysfunction would also lead to abnormal extraocular movements. $#(Choice C)#  Compression of the trigeminal nerve (CN V) could lead to impaired facial sensation and an absent corneal reflex (due to interruption of the afferent sensory limb of the corneal reflex).  However, it would not lead to ptosis or a constricted pupil. $#(Choice D)#  A constricted pupil occurs in Horner syndrome because the normal parasympathetic activity is not balanced by the sympathetic activity.  This relative overactivity of parasympathetics when compared to the activity of sympathetics leads to pupillary constriction.  Decreased parasympathetic activity would be expected to cause a dilated pupil. $#Educational objective# A stroke in the lateral brainstem can lead to ipsilateral Horner syndrome because sympathetic neurons travel next to the spinothalamic tract in the lateral medulla.

The #trigeminal nerve# (CN V) exits the brainstem at the lateral aspect of the #mid-pons# at the level of the #middle cerebellar peduncles# (a key neuroanatomic landmark for locating the nerve).  The trigeminal sensory nuclei (eg, principal sensory, spinal, mesencephalic) run from the midbrain to the upper cervical spine and receive afferent signals for facial sensation via all 3 nerve branches (ophthalmic, maxillary, and mandibular).  The motor nucleus is located in the lateral mid-pons and sends efferent signals to the muscles of mastication (eg, temporalis, masseter, pterygoids) via the mandibular branch. $#Infarcts# involving the #anterior pons# can affect the corticospinal tract (#contralateral hemiparesis#, Babinski sign) and corticobulbar tract (contralateral #lower facial palsy#, dysarthria).  Disruption of the corticopontine fibers that convey motor information from the cortex to the ipsilateral pontine gray matter may also result in contralateral dysmetria and dysdiadochokinesia (#ataxic hemiparesis#).  The cerebellar deficits are contralateral to the lesion as the pontocerebellar fibers arising from the pontine gray matter decussate and enter the cerebellum through the contralateral middle cerebellar peduncle. $#(Choice A)#  The facial nucleus is located in the dorsolateral aspect of the caudal pons, and the nerve exits at the ventrolateral pontomedullary junction (below the middle cerebellar peduncles).

Chronic smoking and poorly controlled hypertension are risk factors.  Unruptured aneurysms are usually asymptomatic, but patients may experience headache and cranial neuropathies due to mass effect. $CN III is a pure motor nerve that exits the midbrain between the posterior cerebral and superior cerebellar arteries and courses along the posterior communicating artery, making it particularly susceptible to injury from posterior communicating artery aneurysms.  It carries general visceral efferent fibers on its surface (for the pupillary light and near-reflex pathways) and general somatic efferent fibers within its interior (innervating superior rectus, inferior rectus, medial rectus, inferior oblique, and levator palpebrae superioris muscles).

    "explanation_2": "$This patient's stroke has resulted in vertigo and bulbar weakness (eg, difficulty swallowing), in addition to loss of pain and temperature sensation on the left side of the face and right side of the body.  Because #most cranial nerves# (other than CN II & IV) #do not decussate# while most of the body's motor and sensory fibers cross the midline in the medulla, brainstem strokes characteristically lead to ipsilateral cranial nerve deficits and contralateral deficits of the body (ie, #crossed signs#).  Therefore, this patient's stroke likely impacted the #left brainstem#.  Specifically, this patient has the following: $• #Vertigo# without hearing loss, suggesting a lesion impacting the #vestibular nucleus# rather than the peripheral CN VIII (which would likely result in hearing loss as well). $• Loss of pain and temperature #sensation# on the left (ipsilateral) side of the #face# with neuropathic pain in that area, suggesting involvement of the #spinal trigeminal nucleus# $• Loss of pain and temperature sensation on the right (contralateral) side of the #body#, which suggests dysfunction of the #spinothalamic tract# $These areas are all located in the left lateral medulla.  This constellation of symptoms is consistent with #lateral medullary (Wallenberg) syndrome#.  @Horner syndrome@ is also common due to damage of the descending @sympathetic nervous system@ fibers that travel very close to the spinothalamic tract. $#(Choices B and E)#  Ischemia impacting the medial medulla can damage the pyramidal tract (contralateral hemiparesis), medial lemniscus (contralateral loss of tactile, vibratory & position sense), and hypoglossal nucleus, which causes tongue deviation toward the lesion due to ipsilateral hypoglossal nerve (CN XII) palsy.  The strong side \"pushes\" the tongue toward the weak side when it is protruded. $#(Choices C and F)#  Strokes in the midbrain can damage the red nucleus (ataxia), cerebral peduncle (contralateral hemiparesis), and, often, oculomotor nerve fascicles (ipsilateral CN III palsy). $#(Choice D)#  A lesion in the right lateral medulla would cause decreased pain and temperature in the right side of the face (ipsilateral) and left side of the body (contralateral). $#Educational objective# A lateral medullary infarct (Wallenberg syndrome) leads to vertigo (vestibular nucleus), loss of pain/temperature sensation on the ipsilateral face (trigeminal nucleus) and contralateral body (spinothalamic tract), bulbar weakness (lower cranial nerves), and ipsilateral Horner syndrome (descending sympathetic nervous system fibers).

The perception of flavor is dependent on both smell and taste, with smell being more important.  Patients with #anosmia (loss of smell)# often describe difficulties with taste, even if taste sensation is intact. $The perception of smell is mediated by odorant molecules that bind to olfactory chemoreceptor cells in the nasal mucosa.  Axons of the chemoreceptor cells make up the olfactory nerve (CN I) rootlets, which project through the #cribriform plate# of the ethmoid bone to synapse on the glomeruli of the olfactory bulb.  The olfactory bulb then projects second-order axons to the primary olfactory cortex in the medial temporal lobe via the olfactory tract. $Head trauma can cause anosmia when acceleration-deceleration forces lead to #avulsion# of the #olfactory nerve rootlets# as they transverse the cribriform plate. $#(Choice A)#  The anterior temporal lobe is important for semantic memory; as a result, injury to this brain region typically results in impaired comprehension about the meaning of words, pictures, and objects. $#(Choice C)#  Dorsolateral medulla infarction causes @Wallenberg syndrome@.

Fibers of the chorda tympani nerve, a branch of the facial nerve (CN VII), also travel with the lingual nerve to relay taste from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue.  If taste disturbances were due to injury of the lingual nerve, tongue numbness would also be present. $#(Choice E)#  Sphenoid bone fractures are associated with damage to the optic nerve (CN II), pituitary gland injury, and leakage of cerebrospinal fluid into the sphenoid sinus. $#Educational objective# Olfactory signals are relayed via the olfactory nerve (CN I) through the cribriform plate to the olfactory bulb, which then projects to the primary olfactory cortex in the medial temporal lobe.

Consequently, patients with left MCA stroke (right-sided motor and sensory deficits) also often have expressive or receptive aphasia due to infarction of the Broca and Wernicke areas, respectively #(choice H).# $#(Choices A and G)#  Occlusion of the anterior cerebral artery causes contralateral motor and sensory deficits, with the lower limb being affected more than the upper limb.  Bilateral anterior cerebral artery occlusion can cause significant behavioral symptoms (eg, abulia), primitive reflexes (eg, Moro, grasp), and urinary incontinence due to damage of the prefrontal cortex. $#(Choices C and F)#  @Saccular aneurysms@ often affect the anterior and posterior communicating arteries in the circle of Willis.

The macula is often spared due to collateral circulation from the MCA. $#(Choice E)#  Basilar artery occlusion usually damages the base of the pons, which contains the corticospinal and corticobulbar tracts, and the paramedian tegmentum.  Consequently, patients typically have quadriplegia, bulbar dysfunction (eg, facial weakness, dysarthria), and oculomotor deficits (eg, horizontal gaze palsy). $#(Choice J)#  Occlusion of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery causes lateral pontine syndrome.  Patients with this condition typically have ipsilateral loss of pain or temperature in the face (trigeminal nucleus), ipsilateral facial weakness (facial nucleus), ipsilateral hearing impairment (cochlear nucleus), contralateral loss of pain and temperature in the trunk and extremities (lateral spinothalamic tract), and cerebellar dysfunction (eg, ataxia, dysmetria). $#Educational objective# Occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) typically results in contralateral hemiparesis and hemisensory loss of the face and upper limb with relative preservation of lower limb function.

This presentation is consistent with the classic triad of #Wernicke encephalopathy# (WE), a complication of thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. #Thiamine# is a cofactor for multiple enzymes involved in glucose metabolism; deficiency results in the brain's inability to use glucose and turn it into energy, leading to neuronal damage and necrosis.

In patients unresponsive to behavioral therapy and unable to take medications, a bladder stimulator is sometimes used. Neural stimulation is used to augment neural signals to the pelvic floor muscles and urinary sphincter, which are innervated from nerves derived from the #S2-S4 nerve roots#: $• #Somatic innervation# of the #pelvic floor muscles# helps to maintain continence because these muscles stabilize the urethra against the anterior vaginal wall. This contraction decreases the angle between the bladder neck and the urethra (ie, urethrovesical angle), thereby compressing the urethra, stopping urine flow, and maintaining continence. Therefore, increasing the strength of the pelvic floor muscles (either through physical therapy or neuromodulatory stimulation) promotes continence. $• The #external urethral sphincter# (EUS) is also under somatic control via the #pudendal nerve# (S2-S4); therefore, stimulation of these nerve roots will increase EUS tone to help improve urinary continence. $Although the #pelvic splanchnic nerves#, derived from S2-S4, are classically described as providing #parasympathetic# input to the bladder and urethral sphincter (which promotes bladder contraction and may worsen incontinence), they are also involved in the #bladder stretch-contraction reflex#. Neural stimulation seems to inhibit this reflex to improve continence. $(Choice A) The nucleus accumbens is part of the basal ganglia that mediates reward and pleasure. Transcranial magnetic stimulation targeting this area has been used to treat addiction, but it plays no role in urinary continence. $(Choice B) Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus has been used to treat the rigidity of Parkinson disease, but it is not involved in urinary continence. $(Choice C) The vagus nerve (CN X) is involved in regulating the gastrointestinal system (eg, parasympathetic innervation stimulates gastric muscle contraction and intestinal motility); stimulation is occasionally used to improve gastric motility. However, the vagus nerve does not play a role in micturition or urinary continence. $(Choice D) The T6 nerve root contributes to the greater splanchnic nerve (T5-T10), which provides sympathetic innervation to the foregut to slow peristalsis. However, sympathetic stimulation of the bladder, which inhibits detrusor contraction, originates lower, from about T10-L2. $(Choice E) The L5 nerve root contributes somatic innervation to many muscles of the lower limb (eg, gluteal muscles, tibialis muscles, extensor hallucis longus) but does not innervate the pelvic floor, bladder, or urethral sphincters. $Educational objective Urge incontinence can be treated with neuromodulation directed toward the S2-S4 nerve roots, which improves pelvic floor muscle strength and contraction of the external urethral sphincter; it may also impact the bladder stretch-contraction reflex.",

The nerve emerges between the psoas and iliacus muscles and passes under the #inguinal ligament# (lateral to the femoral artery) into the thigh before branching in the femoral triangle into an anterior and posterior division. $The optimal site for a #femoral nerve block# is right below the inguinal ligament (ie, in the inguinal crease) at the lateral border of the femoral artery.  Injecting at this site #anesthetizes #the skin and muscles of the #anterior thigh, femur, and knee# and can be used during repair of the quadriceps tendon.  The block also anesthetizes structures supplied by the saphenous nerve (ie, the terminal extension of the femoral nerve) to decrease sensation in the medial leg below the knee. $#(Choices A and D)#  The saphenous nerve (a branch of the femoral nerve that supplies sensation to the leg) can be anesthetized directly at the level of the adductor canal in the thigh (ie, adductor canal block) or at the medial tibial condyle in the knee (ie, saphenous nerve block).  However, the branches of the femoral nerve that supply the knee arise proximal to the saphenous nerve and would not be anesthetized by injection at these locations. $#(Choice C)#  The ischial spine divides the greater and lesser sciatic foramina in the bony pelvis.  The ischial spine tip is a landmark for @pudendal nerve block@, which is used for anesthesia during vaginal deliveries and for minor surgeries of the vagina and perineum. $#(Choice E)#  The obturator canal is a small gap in the obturator membrane (ie, the fibrous sheet covering the obturator foramen) that allows the obturator artery, obturator vein, and obturator nerve to travel from the pelvis to the thigh.  An obturator nerve block would anesthetize the adductor muscles of the thigh and the skin of the medial aspect of the thigh but would not affect the quadriceps muscles or sensation to the knee. $#Educational objective# A femoral nerve block below the inguinal ligament (ie, in the inguinal crease) will anesthetize the skin and muscles of the anterior thigh, femur, and knee.

Spontaneous vestibular schwannomas are usually unilateral, whereas bilateral vestibular schwannomas are associated with neurofibromatosis type 2. $The facial nerve (CN VII) and trigeminal nerve (CN V) are in proximity to CN VIII at the cerebellopontine angle and may be compressed by vestibular schwannomas.  Symptoms can vary based on the pattern of nerve involvement: $• Impairment of the cochlear portion of CN VIII leads to ipsilateral #sensorineural hearing loss# and #tinnitus #(ringing in the ear), and damage to the vestibular portion causes unsteadiness and #disequilibrium#. $• Compression of CN V may cause loss of ipsilateral facial sensation with interruption of the afferent limb of the corneal reflex. $• CN VII compression can result in ipsilateral facial muscle paralysis (eg, asymmetric smile). $#(Choice A)#  Craniopharyngiomas arise from remnants of Rathke's pouch and are typically located in the suprasellar region.

Optic nerve fibers from the temporal part of the retina travel laterally (ie, without crossing) through the optic chiasm to pass into the ipsilateral optic tract.  Lesions involving the #lateral# aspects of the #optic chiasm #can cause dysfunction in only these uncrossed fibers from the ipsilateral temporal retina.  This can cause ipsilateral #nasal hemianopia#, which may occur with aneurysm of the #internal carotid artery# (eg, cavernous or ophthalmic segments), as seen in this patient. $#(Choices A and B)#  A partial lesion involving the retina is more likely to produce focal monocular scotoma than nasal hemianopia because a lesion with the latter would need to involve the entire temporal hemiretina, which does not follow the arterial patterns of blood supply to the retina.  Likewise, a lesion of the optic nerve classically causes monocular total vision loss; nasal hemianopia would be unusual. $#(Choice C)#  Fibers from the nasal retina carry information from the temporal visual fields and cross at the optic chiasm, so a lesion in this area (eg, @pituitary adenoma@) classically causes bitemporal hemianopia. $#(Choice E)#  The optic tract carries information from the contralateral hemivisual field.

Lesions localized to this area can lead to contralateral lower quadrantanopia. $#(Choice H)#  Lesions to the primary visual cortex in the occipital lobe also lead to a contralateral homonymous hemianopia.  If this occurs due to occlusion of the posterior cerebral artery, the macula is typically spared due to collateral circulation from the middle cerebral artery to the occipital pole. $#Educational objective# An aneurysm of the internal carotid artery can laterally impinge on the optic chiasm.

This patient's #perianal anesthesia# with loss of the anocutaneous reflex indicates involvement of the #S2-S4# @nerve roots@. $In an adult, the spinal cord terminates in a tapering fashion as the #conus medullaris# (T12-S4) at the L1-L2 vertebral level.

This condition presents with global ventricular dilation and is more often secondary to intracranial hemorrhage or infection (eg, bacterial meningitis). $#(Choice C)#  Obstruction at the interventricular foramina of Monro would cause enlargement of only the affected lateral ventricle, sparing the contralateral lateral ventricle and the third and fourth ventricles. $#(Choices D and E)#  Obstruction of fourth ventricular outflow (ie, blockage of the lateral foramina of Luschka and the medial foramen of Magendie) would cause enlargement of the lateral, third, and fourth ventricles because they are all proximal to these structures. $#Educational objective# CSF flow occurs as follows: lateral ventricles → interventricular foramina of Monro → third ventricle → cerebral aqueduct of Sylvius → fourth ventricle → lateral foramina of Luschka or midline foramen of Magendie → subarachnoid space.

    "explanation_2": "$This patient's dorsal foot numbness and weakness of foot dorsiflexion and eversion are due to compression of the #common fibular (peroneal) nerve# by his cast.  The common fibular nerve originates in the popliteal fossa as the lateral branch of the sciatic nerve.  After coursing around the posterolateral head and lateral neck of the fibula, it divides into superficial and deep branches: $• The superficial branch innervates the muscles of the lateral compartment of the leg (foot #eversion#) and provides #sensation# to the #dorsum of the foot# and lateral shin. $• The deep branch innervates the muscles of the anterior compartment of the leg (foot and toe #dorsiflexion#) and provides sensation to the #web space# between the first and second toes. $Common fibular nerve injury from extrinsic #compression# (eg, pressure from cast, surgical positioning) most commonly occurs at the #fibular head# because of its bony prominence and the superficial position of the nerve.  Fracture of the fibular neck (weakest point of the proximal fibula) is another common cause of common fibular nerve injury. $#(Choices A and C)#  Compartment syndrome can occur with extremity fracture/casting from increased pressure (eg, swelling) within a confined space.  @Anterior compartment syndrome@ can injure the deep branch of the fibular nerve, causing impaired foot dorsiflexion and sensory loss between the first and second toes, but it would not affect foot eversion or sensation to the dorsal foot.  Lateral compartment syndrome can injure the superficial branch of the fibular nerve, causing impaired foot eversion and sensory loss over the lateral shin and dorsal foot, but weakness in foot dorsiflexion would not be expected. $#(Choices D and E)#  After coursing through the popliteal fossa, the tibial nerve innervates the posterior compartment muscles of the leg.  It then passes through the tarsal tunnel below the medial malleolus and provides sensory innervation over the sole and motor innervation to the intrinsic foot muscles.  Injury at the tarsal tunnel can cause sensory loss over the sole (vs the dorsum) with intrinsic foot muscle weakness.  Injury at the popliteal fossa can cause additional weakness on foot plantar flexion (vs dorsiflexion), foot inversion (vs eversion), and toe flexion. $#Educational objective# Common fibular (peroneal) nerve injury can occur with extrinsic compression at the fibular head, resulting in weakness on foot dorsiflexion and eversion.  Sensation will also be impaired over the lateral shin, dorsal foot, and between the first and second toes.  ",

The maneuver is executed by first instructing the patient to stand with the feet close together, arms to the sides, and eyes open. During this time, the patient is observed for unsteadiness. If the patient is unable to maintain this stance easily, some form of ataxia (cerebellar or sensory) is likely present.$To differentiate sensory from cerebellar ataxia, the patient is asked to close the eyes while maintaining the aforementioned posture. Removing the visual input forces the patient to rely on input from proprioceptive receptors in the trunk and extremities for posture maintenance. Failure to maintain this posture with the eyes closed is referred to as a positive Romberg sign and indicates #sensory ataxia#. Sensory ataxia may be caused by defects in the #posterior column# or #peripheral nerves#, which are classically caused by tabes dorsalis (syphilis) or vitamin B12 deficiency.$Patients who show little or no change in their unsteadiness with their eyes closed (negative Romberg sign) likely have cerebellar ataxia due to impaired motor coordination.

However, it does not follow the spermatic cord, and sensory symptoms involve the skin overlying the suprapubic/hypogastric region, not the groin. $#(Choice E)#  The @obturator nerve@ innervates the medial compartment of the thigh.  Injury presents with weakness of hip adduction and decreased sensation at the medial thigh; it may be injured in pelvic (eg, bladder) surgery but is not at risk in hernia repair. $#Educational objective# Postherniorrhaphy neuropathy refers to groin pain following hernia repair due to injury involving the cutaneous nerves of the lower abdomen/groin.

Radiculopathies occur due to #compression of spinal nerve roots#, which is most commonly due to either: $• #Spinal spondylosis:# Aging leads to #degeneration# of the vertebral bodies, discs, and joints.  Disc space decreases, and joint stress results in osteophyte (eg, bone spur) formation, which slowly narrows the neural foramina and leads to a #subacute onset# of symptoms (as seen in this patient). $• #Vertebral disc herniation:# Degeneration of ligamentous fibers can lead to a tear in the intervertebral disc annulus, resulting in herniation of the nucleus pulposus with potential nerve root compression.  Disc rupture typically occurs acutely (eg, during weight lifting). $#(Choice A)#  Axonal loss in the corticospinal tracts occurs in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a neurodegenerative disease that affects both upper and lower motor neurons.

FCU tendon injury results in decreased wrist flexion power; some wrist flexion is maintained by the other wrist flexors (eg, flexor carpi radialis). $#(Choice C)#  The flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) tendon inserts onto the body of the middle phalanx; it does not contribute to DIP joint flexion. $#(Choice D)#  The @lumbrical muscles@ are intrinsic muscles of the hand that contribute to MCP joint flexion and interphalangeal joint extension.  Injury to the fourth lumbrical tendon would decrease these functions in the small finger where the fourth lumbrical tendon inserts. $#(Choice E)#  The palmar @interosseous muscles@ are intrinsic muscles of the hand that adduct the fingers and, in coordination with the dorsal interossei, assist in MCP joint flexion and interphalangeal joint extension.  Tendon injury would primarily decrease finger adduction. $#Educational objective# The flexor digitorum profundus tendon inserts onto the base of the distal phalanx and flexes the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint.  It is susceptible to rupture when an actively flexed DIP joint is forcefully hyperextended.  ",

The clavicle is the only bone affixing the upper extremity and shoulder girdle to the thorax, and it can be subjected to significant forces during an injury, such as a fall onto the shoulder or outstretched arm.$Because of their attachments on the clavicle, numerous muscles can apply tension on the proximal or distal bone fragments of a clavicle fracture. The anterior portion of the #deltoid muscle# originates on the distal clavicle and inserts onto the humerus. Normally, this part of the muscle acts to abduct, flex, and medially rotate the humerus. However, in a distal clavicle fracture, deltoid muscle tone and the weight of the upper extremity act to pull the #distal fragment# in the #inferolateral# direction. The proximal segment of the bone is pulled in the superomedial direction by the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles. The net effect is to displace the fracture, which increases the risk of #nonunion#.$(Choice A) The biceps brachii originates on the supraglenoid tubercle (long head) and coracoid process (short head) of the scapula. It inserts onto the radial tuberosity and bicipital aponeurosis of the forearm.$(Choice C) The levator scapulae originates on the C1-C4 vertebrae and spans to the superomedial scapula. This muscle raises the scapula and rotates the acromion inferiorly.$(Choice D) The pectoralis minor spans from the coracoid process of the scapula to the third, fourth, and fifth ribs and stabilizes the scapula against the thoracic wall.$(Choice E) The teres minor spans from the lateral scapula to the greater tubercle of the humerus. It stabilizes the glenohumeral joint and laterally rotates the humerus.$Educational objective The clavicle is commonly fractured in children after a fall on an outstretched arm. In a distal clavicle fracture, the deltoid muscle and the weight of the arm cause inferolateral displacement of the distal fragment, whereas the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles cause superomedial displacement of the proximal fragment."

The patella is a large sesamoid bone that facilitates knee extension, protects the joint from direct injury, and improves nourishment of the distal femur articular cartilage.  The quadriceps tendon inserts at the superior pole of the patella and wraps distally around the patella to become the patellar tendon, which inserts at the tibial tuberosity. $Patella fractures are most commonly due to a #direct blow# to the #anterior aspect# of the knee (eg, landing on a flexed knee in a fall, striking the knee against the dashboard in a frontal motor vehicle collision).  The patella can also be fractured indirectly due to excessive force transmitted through the quadriceps tendon (eg, landing on the feet after falling from a height).  Patients develop acute swelling (often with an associated effusion), focal tenderness, #inability to extend the knee# against gravity, and a #palpable gap# in the extensor mechanism. $#(Choice A)#  The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) protects against excessive posterior knee movement and is the least frequently injured knee ligament.  PCL injury results in a positive posterior drawer test (increased backward movement of the tibia against a fixed femur). $#(Choice B)#  The medial collateral ligament (MCL) protects against valgus stress on the knee and excessive external tibial rotation.  MCL injury occurs after a @lateral blow to the knee@ or indirect stress from excessive lower leg rotation or abduction.  Patients have excessive joint widening on valgus stress (eg, the femur is held in a fixed position while an abducting [lateral] force is applied to the lower leg/foot). $#(Choice C)#  The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) controls anterior knee movement and prevents excessive tibial rotation.  ACL injury often occurs due to sudden acceleration or deceleration in noncontact athletic injuries.  Patients have laxity of forward movement of the tibia against a fixed femur (@anterior drawer test@). $#(Choice E)#  Knee flexors include the hamstring muscles (biceps femoris, semitendinosus, semimembranosus), gracilis, gastrocnemius, and sartorius.  Hamstring injury can decrease hip extension and knee flexion.  However, these muscles do not involve the patella. $#Educational objective# Patella fractures are most commonly due to a direct impact to the anterior aspect of the knee.  Signs include an acutely swollen knee, focal patella tenderness, inability to extend the knee against gravity, and a palpable gap in the extensor mechanism.  ",

During abduction of the humerus, the supraspinatus initiates movement through the first 10-15 degrees; subsequently, the deltoid provides the primary abductive force while the supraspinatus provides stability to the joint.$Of all the rotator cuff structures, the #supraspinatus tendon# is most commonly affected in rotator cuff syndrome. This tendon is vulnerable to chronic repeated trauma from #impingement# between the head of the humerus and the acromion during abduction. Inflammation and fibrosis can worsen the problem by increasing friction between the head of the humerus and the acromion, as well as causing inflammation of the subacromial bursa. On examination, the action of the supraspinatus can be isolated with the \"empty-can\" supraspinatus test: abduction of the humerus in parallel to the axis of the scapula (30 degrees forward flexion) while in full internal rotation (thumbs pointed to the floor).$(Choice A) The long head of the biceps brachii originates on the supraglenoid tubercle of the scapula and inserts on the radius.

Compression of nerve roots results in a number of neurologic symptoms, including #lower extremity pain#, #numbness/paresthesia#, and #weakness#.  The onset of pain with walking is referred to as \"neurogenic claudication\" as it may resemble symptoms seen in vascular claudication.  However, the symptoms of spinal stenosis are #posture-dependent#.  Extension of the lumbar spine (eg, standing, walking upright) further narrows the spinal canal and worsens the symptoms, whereas lumbar flexion (eg, walking uphill, @leaning on a stroller/shopping cart@) relieves the pain. $Degenerative arthritis of the spine is the most common cause of spinal stenosis, typically occurring in patients age >60.  Over time, the intervertebral disc degenerates and begins to protrude, resulting in a corresponding loss in disc height.  This loss of height places a disproportionate load on the posterior aspect of the spinal column, leading to formation of facet joint osteophytes and hypertrophy of the @ligamentum flavum@ (a strong elastic ligament supporting the posterior aspect of the spinal canal).  These physiologic changes lead to mechanical compression of nerve roots and corresponding neurologic symptoms. $#(Choice A)#  The anterior longitudinal ligament covers the anterior aspect of the vertebral bodies, preventing excess spinal extension. $#(Choice B)#  The iliolumbar ligament connects the fifth lumbar vertebrae to the iliac crest, strengthening the lumbosacral joint. $#(Choice C)#  The interspinous ligaments connect the spinous processes and help limit flexion of the spine. $#(Choice E)#  The sacroiliac ligament prevents distraction of the sacroiliac joint. $#Educational objective# Spinal stenosis occurs most commonly in the lumbar region and presents with posture-dependent lower extremity pain, numbness/paresthesia, and weakness.  The most common cause is degenerative arthritis of the spine, which results in narrowing of the spinal canal due to intervertebral disc herniation, ligamentum flavum hypertrophy, and osteophyte formation affecting the facet joints.

    "explanation_2": "$This patient's upper extremity neurologic symptoms in the setting of an extra rib are highly suggestive of #thoracic outlet syndrome# (TOS).  The thoracic outlet refers to the region above the first rib and behind the clavicle that is bordered by the cervical vertebral bones and the sternum.  #Compression# of the #brachial plexus# as it passes through the thoracic outlet can cause upper extremity numbness, tingling, and weakness (most often in an ulnar distribution due to compression of the lower trunk).  Involvement of the #subclavian vein and artery# can also occur and lead to upper extremity swelling and exertional arm pain. $TOS most commonly occurs due to compression of the brachial plexus within the #scalene triangle#, which is formed by the anterior and middle scalene muscles and the first rib.  The anterior scalene muscle originates from the C3-C6 transverse processes and attaches to the scalene tubercle of the first rib.  The middle scalene originates from the C2-C7 transverse processes and inserts into the posterior portion of the first rib.  The brachial plexus trunks and subclavian artery pass between the anterior and middle scalenes; the subclavian vein runs anterior to the anterior scalene. $The presence of an #anomalous cervical rib# or scalene muscular anomalies can predispose to TOS.  Affected patients typically have a history of trauma or repetitive overhead arm movements (eg, swimming, stacking boxes). $#(Choice A)#  The @coracobrachialis@ originates from the coracoid process of the scapula and acts to flex the arm at the glenohumeral joint.  The musculocutaneous nerve pierces the muscle near its insertion into the humerus; overuse of the coracobrachialis (eg, excessive bench pressing) can cause entrapment of the musculocutaneous nerve, causing impaired elbow flexion and lateral forearm sensory loss. $#(Choice C)#  The @subscapularis muscle@ originates in the subscapular fossa of the scapula and inserts into the lesser tubercle of the humerus.  It acts to adduct and internally rotate the humerus. $#(Choices D and E)#  The teres major muscle and long head of the triceps brachii form the inferior and medial borders of the @quadrangular space@ through which the axillary nerve passes.  Entrapment of the axillary nerve within the quadrangular space can cause sensory loss over the lateral shoulder and impair shoulder abduction. $#Educational objective# Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is most often caused by compression of the brachial plexus as it passes through the scalene triangle, the space bordered by the anterior and middle scalene muscles and the first rib.  Symptoms typically include upper extremity numbness, tingling, and weakness that worsen with repetitive overhead arm movements.  The presence of an anomalous cervical rib is a risk factor for TOS.

This patient has weakness not only with hip flexion but also with knee extension.  Of these muscles, only the sartorius and rectus femoris (part of quadriceps femoris) cross the knee and therefore can influence both hip and knee movements. $The #rectus femoris# originates from the anterior inferior iliac spine and the ilium and inserts at the base of the patella via the quadriceps tendon, allowing it to flex the hip and #also extend the knee# upon contraction.  The rectus femoris (and quadriceps as a whole) provides stability and control during ambulation, deceleration (eg, landing a jump), and rapid changes in movement (eg, cutting in soccer). $In contrast, the sartorius originates from the anterior superior iliac spine and crosses the anterior thigh to insert at the superomedial surface of the tibia.

Muscular weakness or tendon rupture is suggested by the @Trendelenburg sign@: with the patient standing on the affected leg, the pelvis falls to the contralateral side due to impaired abduction. $#(Choice A)#  The @adductor brevis@ originates from the inferior pubic ramus and inserts onto the linea aspera of the femur.  Strain typically produces groin and medial thigh pain that can be reproduced by resisted hip adduction (not abduction). $#(Choices C and D)#  The @obturator externus@ originates from the obturator membrane and obturator foramen and inserts onto the trochanteric fossa of the femur.  The quadratus femoris originates from the ischial tuberosity and inserts onto the intertrochanteric crest of the femur.  These muscles externally rotate the hip (regardless of whether the hip is flexed, unlike gluteus medius), and muscle strain would cause pain on resisted external (not internal) rotation. $#(Choice E)#  @Vastus lateralis@ is part of the quadriceps femoris complex.  It originates from the intertrochanteric line, greater trochanter, gluteal tuberosity, and linea aspera of the femur and inserts onto the tibial tubercle via the quadriceps tendon/patellar ligament.  Strain presents with thigh pain that is reproduced by resisted knee extension. $#Educational objective# Greater trochanteric pain syndrome is an overuse tendinopathy of the gluteus medius and gluteus minimus at their insertion on the greater trochanter of the femur.  Examination shows tenderness over the greater trochanter; pain is reproduced by resisted hip abduction and internal rotation (when the hip is flexed).  ",

    "explanation_2": "$This patient has #Osgood-Schlatter disease# (OSD), a common cause of knee pain in adolescents due to overuse of the #quadriceps# muscle group (ie, rectus femoris, vastus intermedius, vastus lateralis, vastus medialis).  The quadriceps is located in the anterior thigh and is responsible for #knee extension#.  Its tendon initially inserts at the superior pole of the patella.  The tendon envelops the patella and continues as the patellar ligament, which then inserts at the #tibial tubercle#.  As a result, contraction of the quadriceps (eg, hiking, running) creates traction on the tibial tubercle. $In skeletally immature children, the tibial tubercle forms as a #secondary ossification center# (apophysis) of the tibia, and the cartilaginous nature of the developing tibial tuberosity makes it more prone to injury compared to fully ossified bone in adults.  Repetitive quadriceps contraction results in chronic @avulsion/fragmentation of the tubercle@, with corresponding tenderness and swelling, as seen in this patient. $#(Choice A)#  The biceps femoris, along with the semitendinosus and semimembranosus, forms the @hamstring muscle group@ in the posterior thigh; it is responsible for hip extension and knee flexion.  The long head of the biceps femoris originates from the ischial tuberosity, whereas the short head originates from the inferior third of the linea aspera.  Both insert at the head of the fibula. $#(Choice B)#  The popliteus originates from the lateral condyle of the femur and lateral meniscus and inserts at the proximal shaft of the tibia.  It flexes and medially rotates the leg (unlocks an extended knee). $#(Choice D)#  The @sartorius@ originates from the anterior superior iliac spine and inserts at the superomedial surface of the tibia.  Because of its oblique orientation across the anterior thigh, the sartorius is responsible for hip flexion, external rotation, and abduction, as well as knee flexion.  This combination of movements is needed to sit in a cross-legged position. $#(Choice E)#  The @tibialis anterior@ originates from the lateral condyle of the tibia, the upper half of the lateral tibia, and the interosseus membrane.  It inserts at the cuneiform and first metatarsal.  It is responsible for ankle dorsiflexion and foot inversion. $#Educational objective# Repetitive traction at the tibial tubercle due to quadriceps contraction can lead to avulsion and fragmentation of the tibial tubercle in skeletally immature children, causing Osgood-Schlatter disease.

    "explanation_2": "$Bleeding peptic ulcer disease should be considered in patients who develop acute epigastric pain, unstable vital signs, or hematemesis, particularly in the setting of prior dyspepsia.  Most peptic ulcers are caused by Helicobacter pylori infection or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use; other risk factors include smoking, older age, and glucocorticoid use. $Duodenal ulcers are more common than gastric ulcers and tend to occur anteriorly.  Ulcers located on the anterior wall of the duodenal bulb are more prone to perforation; those on the posterior wall are more likely to cause hemorrhage.  These complications are explained by the relationship of the duodenal bulb to adjacent organs.  The duodenal bulb is approximately 5 cm long, beginning at the pylorus and ending at the neck of the gallbladder.  The gallbladder and liver lie anterior to the duodenal bulb within the intraperitoneal space; the gastroduodenal artery, common biliary duct, and portal vein are posterior to the bulb; and the head of the pancreas is located inferiorly. $When an ulcer penetrates the #posterior duodenal wall#, it is likely to erode into the @gastroduodenal artery@, which perfuses both the pylorus and the proximal part of the duodenum.

If the #rectus abdominis# is #transected horizontally#, the #inferior epigastric arteries# must be identified and ligated bilaterally to prevent bleeding complications (eg, hematoma). $#(Choice A)#  The deep circumflex iliac artery supplies blood to the anterior iliac crest and arises from the lateral aspect of the external iliac artery.  It is located significantly laterally and inferiorly to the rectus abdominis muscle. $#(Choice B)#  The inguinal canal contains structures (eg, ilioinguinal nerve, round ligament [women], spermatic cord [men]) between the abdomen and external genitalia.  Men are more susceptible to @inguinal hernias@ compared to women due to their relatively larger deep inguinal ring. $#(Choice C)#  The femoral sheath is located in the inguinofemoral region and contains the @femoral artery@, femoral vein, and femoral canal. $#(Choice E)#  The @lateral femoral cutaneous nerve@ travels under the inguinal ligament.  It provides sensory innervation to the anterolateral thigh.  Entrapment (meralgia paresthetica) most commonly occurs in obese or pregnant persons or in those who wear garments that are tight around the hip. $#Educational objective# Horizontal transection of the rectus abdominis muscle must be performed with great caution as the inferior epigastric arteries enter this muscle at the level of the arcuate line.  The inferior epigastric arteries below the arcuate line are susceptible to injury (eg, hematoma) due to lack of a supporting posterior rectus sheath.  ",

    "explanation_2": "$This patient's gastrointestinal biopsy demonstrates submucosal glands, a characteristic microscopic feature of the @duodenum@.  The integrity of the duodenal mucosa depends on the complete and rapid neutralization of hydrochloric acid in gastric contents.  This is accomplished by #alkaline secretions# from 2 primary sources: $• #Submucosal (Brunner) glands# secrete copious amounts of alkaline mucus.  These glands are most numerous in the first part of the #duodenum# (near the pylorus) but may be found intermittently up to the ampulla of Vater.  The ducts of these glands pass through the muscularis mucosa and terminate in the mucosal crypts (crypts of Lieberkühn). $• The epithelial cells of the pancreatic ductules and ducts produce watery secretions containing high concentrations of bicarbonate ions.  The strongly alkaline #pancreatic secretions# are then emptied into the duodenum at the ampulla. $Bicarbonate secretion from the submucosal glands is induced by tactile stimulation of the duodenal mucosa and increased parasympathetic activity following meals.  In addition, the presence of acid in the duodenum causes the release of #secretin# from the mucosa, which stimulates bicarbonate secretion from the submucosal glands and pancreas. $Excess gastric acid secretion (eg, caused by antral Helicobacter pylori infection) can eventually lead to #hyperplasia# of the submucosal glands, imparting a nodular appearance endoscopically.  Increasing levels of gastric acid may ultimately overwhelm the mucosal defense systems, resulting in duodenal mucosal injury (eg, epigastric discomfort, bloating, flatulence, bleeding). $#(Choices A and C)#  The antrum of the stomach contains numerous mucosal pyloric glands that secrete copious mucus for protection.  The body and fundus of the stomach contain mucosal oxyntic glands that secrete gastric acid.  However, submucosal glands are not present in the stomach. $#(Choice D)#  The mucosal villi and crypts in the jejunum contain goblet cells (secrete mucus) and enterocytes (secrete water and electrolytes); these secretions have only minimal bicarbonate content.  Submucosal glands are not present in the jejunum. $#(Choices E and F)#  Bicarbonate is secreted by epithelial cells in the ileal villi and colonic crypts to neutralize acid produced by colonic bacteria.  Submucosal glands are not present in these locations. $#Educational objective# Gastric acid is neutralized by bicarbonate from the submucosal (Brunner) glands of the duodenum and from pancreatic duct secretions.

An important cause of cirrhosis-related morbidity and mortality is the development of #variceal hemorrhaging# as a direct consequence of portal hypertension. $#Cirrhosis# (of any type) represents the end stage of progressive hepatic fibrosis.  It is characterized by distortion of the hepatic architecture and formation of regenerative nodules.  Cirrhosis is the most common cause of #portal hypertension#, which arises from increased resistance to portal flow at the hepatic sinusoids.  Chronic portal hypertension leads to dilation of small, pre-existing vascular channels between the portal and systemic circulations.  These dilated collateral vessels (@portosystemic anastomoses@) commonly form in the anterior abdomen (caput medusae), lower rectum (anorectal varices), and #inferior end of the esophagus# (esophageal varices). $Treatment sometimes includes inserting a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) between the portal vein and hepatic vein percutaneously, relieving portal hypertension by shunting blood to the systemic circulation. $#(Choice B)#  The middle colic vein drains the transverse colon. $#(Choices C and F)#  In cirrhosis, the paraumbilical veins can shunt blood from the portal system to superficial epigastric veins in the abdominal wall, causing @caput medusae@. $#(Choice D)#  The right gastroepiploic vein drains venous blood from the inferior portions of the stomach.  It runs along the greater curvature of the stomach. $#(Choice E)#  The splenic vein drains blood from the spleen.  It joins with the superior mesenteric vein to form the hepatic portal vein.  Patients with portal hypertension can develop splenomegaly due to congestion of the splenic red pulp. $#Educational objective# In cirrhosis, portal hypertension arises from increased resistance to portal flow at the hepatic sinusoids.  This causes increased pressure in the portosystemic collateral veins within the lower end of the esophagus, anterior abdomen, and lower rectum.  Dilation of these collateral vessels is responsible for the esophageal varices, caput medusae, and anorectal varices commonly seen in patients with cirrhosis.  ",

    "explanation_2": "Infarcts in an otherwise normal liver are rare because it has a dual blood supply: the portal vein and hepatic artery. Should the hepatic artery become occluded, the portal venous supply and retrograde arterial flow through accessory vessels (e.g., from the inferior phrenic, adrenal, intercostal arteries, etc.) is typically sufficient to sustain the liver parenchyma. The notable exception is when a transplanted liver undergoes hepatic artery thrombosis. In this case, the liver can develop biliary tree infarction and organ failure because the collateral blood supply is severed during transplantation.$(Choice A) The spleen is relatively vulnerable to infarction because the perfusion via the splenic artery is end-arterial. Wedge-shaped, capsule-based splenic infarcts occur and are a known complication of sickle cell anemia, infective endocarditis, and cardiac mural thrombosis.$(Choice B) Irreversible damage appears to occur in the most vulnerable of neurons after approximately 5 minutes of complete ischemia.$(Choice C) The kidney, similar to the spleen, has an end-arterial blood supply, and is generally able to tolerate warm ischemia for at least 30 minutes. Longer periods of complete ischemia result in immediate functional loss; late recovery of renal function is incomplete or absent.$(Choice E) The myocardium can endure complete arterial ischemia for twenty or thirty minutes without severe consequences. Briefer periods of ischemia do not result in necrosis, but rather myocardial stunning. Coronary artery embolism is an uncommon cause of myocardial infarction; nonetheless, it should be considered in myocardial-infarcted patients with atrial fibrillation, infective endocarditis, left atrial or ventricular thrombus, and in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization.$Educational objective Organ susceptibility to infarction after occlusion of a feeding artery is ranked from greatest to least as follows: central nervous system, myocardium, kidney, spleen, and liver. The presence of a dual and/or collateral blood supply (as seen in the liver, which is supplied by the hepatic artery and portal vein) enables an organ to tolerate arterial occlusion better than those with end-arterial circulations."

  "explanation_2": "The patient described in the question stem is likely suffering from alcohol-induced cirrhosis, a form of micronodular cirrhosis associated with hepatocyte death followed by fine fibrosis of the liver. As cirrhosis worsens and the number of functioning hepatocytes decreases, the functional ability of the liver diminishes. In advanced disease, portal blood has an increasingly difficult time passing through the liver because the vasculature becomes compromised by the progressive fibrosis, causing portal hypertension. Of the structures identified on the image above, only the portal and splenic veins are part of the portal venous system. In this patient, high pressure would be expected throughout the portal system, including the superior mesenteric, portal, and splenic veins. The effects of prolonged portal hypertension include varices at the four sites of portocaval anastomoses (esophagus, rectum, umbilicus, and retroperitoneal), as well as ascites.$The pathogenesis of ascites in patients with cirrhosis is complex. In addition to mechanical compromise of portal vein flow by fibrotic tissue, vasoactive agents also play a role by causing dilatation of the splanchnic arterial vasculature and further intrahepatic vasoconstriction. These processes result in increased portal vein hydrostatic pressure leading to ascitic fluid formation, as well as decreased systemic perfusion pressure. The kidney senses the decreased perfusion pressure (accentuated by renal vasoconstriction in hepatorenal syndrome) and responds with avid retention of sodium and water, thus promoting further increase in ascitic fluid formation. Treatment of ascites secondary to cirrhosis involves restriction of sodium intake combined with diuretics. The most commonly prescribed initial therapy is a combination of furosemide and spironolactone.$(Choice A) The descending abdominal aorta will have elevated pressures in patients with systemic hypertension.$(Choice B) The inferior vena cava experiences increased pressure in cases of heart failure. This patient does not present with the typical symptoms associated with heart failure, such as lower extremity edema and shortness of breath.$(Choice D) The celiac trunk emerges from the aorta at this level (T12 / L1).$Educational objective The portal vein can be identified on cross-sectional scans lying medial to (or just within) the right lobe of the liver and anterior to the inferior vena cava. The pressure in the portal system is elevated in liver cirrhosis."

  "explanation_2": "This patient's presentation is concerning for #appendicitis#, which can cause both visceral (vague, nonlocalized) and somatic (sharp, well-localized) abdominal pain. #Visceral abdominal pain# is most often due to luminal distension and stretching of smooth muscle and is carried by general visceral afferent fibers of the autonomic nervous system. The pain typically occurs in the #midline# region and is #poorly localized# and of a dull, constant, or cramping quality. Patients with visceral pain also commonly develop nausea, vomiting, or sweating due to activation of the autonomic nervous system. In contrast, somatic pain is usually due to irritation of the parietal peritoneum and is well localized, more severe, and worsened with deep inspiration or pushing on the abdominal wall.$The afferent pain fibers for the appendix, proximal colon (including the cecum), and overlying visceral peritoneum cross through the superior mesenteric plexus and enter the spinal cord at the T10 level to produce vague, referred pain at the umbilicus #(choice C)#.

With peritoneal irritation, the abdominal wall becomes very sensitive to gentle palpation or sudden release of pressure (ie, rebound tenderness).$The appendix is usually located 2 cm beneath the ileocecal valve in the right lower quadrant. Depending on its orientation, there can be additional clinical findings. A pelvic appendix lies against the right obturator internus muscle, causing right lower quadrant pain with internal rotation of the right hip #(choice A)#.

This allows the #GE junction# and #proximal stomach# to slide upward into the thoracic cavity and predisposes patients to reflux symptoms (eg, heartburn, regurgitation, epigastric/chest pain) due to incompetence of the lower esophageal sphincter.$• #Paraesophageal# hernias are rarer and occur due to a #defect# (hole) in the phrenoesophageal membrane. Laxity of the gastrocolic and gastrosplenic ligaments (which anchor the stomach in the abdomen) allows the #gastric fundus# to migrate into the thoracic cavity. Larger defects can also result in the subsequent herniation of the GE junction and surrounding structures (eg, bowel, spleen) into the chest. This predisposes patients to gastric volvulus, ulcerations, and respiratory complications (due to lung compression).$(Choice A) Barrett esophagus is the metaplastic replacement of normal squamous cells in the distal esophagus with squamocolumnar cells and occurs as a result of chronic acid reflux. Patients with Barrett esophagus are at increased risk of esophageal cancer, but it does not cause herniation.$(Choice C) Diaphragmatic muscle paralysis due to C3-5 motor nerve injury causes an elevated hemidiaphragm. Patients are typically asymptomatic (due to compensation by the other respiratory muscles), but dyspnea or orthopnea can occur. It is not associated with herniation of intrabdominal contents into the chest.$(Choice D) Failure of the posterolateral diaphragmatic foramina to fuse can cause a Bochdalek hernia. This congenital hernia is typically diagnosed pre- or perinatally; pulmonary hypoplasia with neonatal respiratory distress is common.$(Choice E) Herniation of the viscera through the omental foramen (foramen of Winslow) causes an intraabdominal hernia known as lesser sac hernia. Lesser sac hernias are very rare, typically involve the small bowel, and cause severe abdominal pain due to bowel strangulation or obstruction.$Educational objective Hiatal hernias occur when contents of the abdominal cavity herniate through the diaphragm at the esophageal hiatus into the thoracic cavity. Sliding hiatal hernias occur due to laxity of the phrenoesophageal membrane, leading to herniation of the gastroesophageal junction and proximal stomach, whereas paraesophageal hernias occur due to defects in the membrane, resulting in the gastric fundus herniation."

    "explanation_2": "This patient's presentation is consistent with #subclavian steal syndrome#, which typically occurs due to hemodynamically significant stenosis of the subclavian artery proximal to the origin of the vertebral artery. #Subclavian stenosis# is typically caused by atherosclerosis, although less common etiologies include Takayasu arteritis and complications from heart surgery (eg, aortic coarctation repair). The lowered distal subclavian arterial pressure leads to reversal in blood flow (\"steal\") from the contralateral vertebral artery to the ipsilateral vertebral artery, away from the brainstem.$Most patients with subclavian artery stenosis are asymptomatic. When symptoms occur, they are typically related to #arm ischemia# in the affected extremity (eg, exercise-induced fatigue, pain, paresthesias) or #vertebrobasilar insufficiency# (eg, dizziness, vertigo, drop attacks). Physical examination can show a significant difference (>15 mm Hg) in brachial systolic blood pressure between the affected arm and normal arm. Doppler ultrasound of the cerebrovascular and upper extremity arterial circulation establishes the diagnosis in most patients.$(Choice A) Although innominate (brachiocephalic) artery stenosis or occlusion can cause subclavian steal syndrome, patients with significant occlusion would develop retrograde flow through the right vertebral artery rather than the left.$(Choice B) Internal carotid artery occlusion may occur due to thrombosis or embolism, leading to a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or ischemic stroke. Patients typically have profound neurologic deficits (eg, contralateral homonymous hemianopsia, hemiparesis, hemisensory loss), including cortical signs (eg, aphasia, agnosia, neglect). Blood flow reversal in the vertebral artery is not characteristic.$(Choice C) Coronary-subclavian steal phenomenon occurs in patients with prior coronary artery bypass surgery using the internal mammary artery (IMA). Similar to that of subclavian steal syndrome, blood flow through the IMA can reverse and steal flow from the coronary circulation during increased demand (eg, upper extremity exercise). However, symptoms are typically related to coronary ischemia (eg, angina pectoris).$(Choice E) Right vertebral artery occlusion usually leads to ischemic stroke or TIA and can cause similar symptoms as seen in this patient. However, occlusion of the right vertebral artery would cause retrograde flow on the right versus the left, and symptoms are not typically precipitated by arm exertion.$Educational objective Subclavian steal syndrome occurs due to severe stenosis of the proximal subclavian artery, which leads to reversal in blood flow from the contralateral vertebral artery to the ipsilateral vertebral artery. Patients may have symptoms related to arm ischemia in the affected extremity (eg, exercise-induced fatigue, pain, paresthesias) or vertebrobasilar insufficiency (eg, dizziness, vertigo)."

Right coronary dominance is present in approximately 85% of patients and involves the RCA coursing past the RV to give off the posterior descending artery (PDA) and supply the inferior LV wall.  Left coronary dominance is present in approximately 10% of patients and involves the LCx extending around the left side of the heart to give off the PDA and supply the inferior LV wall.  Approximately 5% of patients have codominant circulation. $In virtually all patients, the RV is fully supplied by the RCA, and in patients with left-dominant circulation, none of the inferior LV wall is supplied by the RCA.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient most likely has a #patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)#. The ductus arteriosus is an embryonic derivative of the #sixth aortic arch# that allows fetal blood to pass directly from the pulmonary artery to the proximal descending aorta (bypassing the pulmonary circulation). This vessel usually closes shortly after birth, secondary to decreased #prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)# levels and increased oxygen concentration. Patency of the ductus after birth results in a left-to-right shunt that can cause left ventricular volume overload and symptoms of heart failure (eg, failure to thrive, respiratory distress). Physical examination will show a continuous \"machinery-like\" murmur and palpable thrill over the left infraclavicular region due to turbulent blood flow through the PDA.$Pharmacologic closure of a PDA can be achieved by PGE2 synthesis inhibitors (eg, indomethacin) in premature infants. However, older patients usually require surgical ligation or percutaneous PDA occlusion.$(Choice A) The bulbus cordis forms the beginning of the ventricular outflow tract in the embryonic heart. This structure forms the smooth portions of the left and right ventricles adjacent to the aorta and pulmonary artery, respectively.$(Choice B) The fourth aortic arch on the left forms the arch of the aorta between the left carotid artery and ductus arteriosus. Abnormalities during development can result in coarctation (narrowing) of the aorta, which can present with continuous murmurs over the back due to collateral formation.$(Choice C) The primitive atrium receives blood from the sinus venosus in the embryonic heart and transmits it to the primitive ventricle. The primitive atrium forms the rough portions of the left and right atria.$(Choice D) The sinus venosus is an embryologic structure within the heart that receives blood from the vena cava. In adults, this structure forms the smooth portion of the right atrium, known as the sinus venarum.$Educational objective The ductus arteriosus is derived from the sixth embryonic aortic arch. A patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) causes left-to-right shunting of blood that can be heard as a continuous murmur over the left infraclavicular region. Indomethacin (a PGE2 synthesis inhibitor) can be used to close a PDA in premature infants, but surgical ligation is often necessary in older patients."

The areas are thought to be predominantly affected due to increases in the rate of rise of pressure (dP/dT) and in shearing forces at these sites in patients with severe hypertension.$#(Choices A, B, C, and E)# Distal propagation of a type A dissection or proximal propagation of a type B dissection can affect the aortic arch (eg, brachiocephalic artery, left common carotid artery, left subclavian artery). Either type of dissection can propagate distally into the thoracoabdominal aorta, involving the origins of the celiac trunk, intercostal arteries, and renal arteries.$Educational Objectives The intimal tear in Stanford type A aortic dissection (involving the ascending aorta) usually originates in the sinotubular junction whereas the intimal flap in Stanford type B aortic dissection usually starts near the origin of the left subclavian artery. Dissections can propagate distally to the thoracoabdominal aorta."

Viral infection is the most common cause of acute pericarditis, with coxsackievirus (types A and B) and echovirus being the most common organisms.  Patients with pericarditis typically experience chest pain, which may be intermittent (as in this patient) but is often pleuritic and/or positional (eg, relieved by leaning forward). $As in this patient, viral pericarditis can be #complicated by pericardial effusion# due to fibrinous or serofibrinous pericardial inflammation.  Symptoms of @pericardial effusion@ may include a sensation of #chest tightness# or fullness and #dyspnea on exertion# (due to decreased diastolic ventricular filling that leads to decreased stroke volume).  In addition, pericardial effusion often causes the following clinical findings: $• #Tachycardia# to compensate for decreased ventricular filling $• #Low voltage QRS# on ECG and diminished heart sounds to auscultation due to pericardial fluid accumulation increasing the distance between the heart and the ECG leads or stethoscope $• #Electrical alternans# on ECG due to the swinging motion of the heart in the fluid-filled pericardial cavity, causing a beat-to-beat variation in the QRS axis $Patients with pericardial effusion classically have an #enlarged, globular cardiac silhouette# on #chest x-ray#, which occurs when progressive pericardial stretching over days to weeks (ie, subacute course) allows large volumes (eg, up to 1-2 L) of pericardial fluid to accumulate.  #Clear lung fields# are typically seen because the increase in pericardial pressure (due to pericardial fluid accumulation) affects the lower pressure, right-sided heart chambers more than the left-sided heart chambers.

Pupil size is governed by the balance between ocular sympathetic (dilation) and parasympathetic (constriction) @efferents to the iris@.  These responses are tested by examining the pupils in bright and dim light: $• In #bright light#, the parasympathetic pathway is dominant.  With #parasympathetic defects#, pupillary constriction occurs in the \"good\" eye but not the \"bad,\" causing the difference between pupils to widen (ie, #anisocoria increases#) in bright light.

With #sympathetic defects#, pupillary dilation occurs in the \"good\" eye but not the \"bad,\" causing anisocoria to #increase in the dark#.  The smaller pupil is abnormal. $This patient's anisocoria increases in bright light, consistent with a parasympathetic defect causing her right pupil to not constrict properly in response to light; the unaffected left pupil constricts normally.  In the dark, both pupils dilate because sympathetic input is intact bilaterally; a small degree of anisocoria will still be present because basal parasympathetic activity is reduced in the left eye. $#(Choices A and B)#  The @visual pathway@ carries afferent signals from the retina to the visual cortex.  Lesions preceding the optic chiasm (eg, retina, optic nerve [CN II]) cause monocular vision loss; however, pupils remain symmetric (no anisocoria) with ambient lighting because the efferent sympathetic or parasympathetic tracts are not involved.  Instead, prechiasmatic visual pathway lesions cause a @relative afferent pupillary defect@: When light is shone in the affected eye, no signal is transmitted, so pupillary constriction is equally impaired bilaterally. $#(Choices E and F)#  With sympathetic defects (eg, damage to cervical sympathetic chain or ganglia), the affected pupil cannot properly dilate, so anisocoria increases in dim light.  In response to bright light, both pupils constrict because parasympathetic innervation is intact bilaterally, and the anisocoria is reduced. $#Educational objective# Anisocoria (asymmetric pupils) is caused by a lesion in the ocular parasympathetic (constriction) or sympathetic (dilation) pathways.  In this patient, anisocoria increases in bright light, indicating that the larger right pupil is unable to constrict due to a defect in the right parasympathetic pathway. ",

Injection of exogenous ADH can help distinguish between central and nephrogenic DI: #ADH administration# substantially #increases urine osmolality# in patients with central DI, whereas patients with nephrogenic DI typically have a more limited increase in urine osmolality (<300 mOsm/L increase).$ ADH is synthesized by magnocellular neurosecretory cells in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus.

Injury to the hypothalamus or posterior pituitary (eg, head trauma, transsphenoidal neurosurgery, suprasellar masses) can result in central DI.  Damage to the more distal portions of the hypothalamic-hypophyseal tract (ie, below the infundibulum) typically causes transient DI because the cell bodies of the magnocellular neurons remain intact.  However, #hypothalamic injury# results in death of the magnocellular neurons, causing #permanent central DI#. $(Choice A)  The anterior pituitary produces ACTH, TSH, gonadotrophic hormones, prolactin, and growth hormone.

Furthermore, this patient's large increase in urine concentration following ADH administration is more suggestive of central DI. $(Choice D)  Isolated posterior pituitary damage most often causes transient central DI because the cell bodies of the magnocellular neurons remain intact and can undergo axonal regeneration to allow adequate ADH release into the circulation. $ (Choice E)  Thalamic nuclei are involved in relaying sensory and motor signals to the cerebral cortex and in regulating alertness and consciousness. $ Educational objective Injury to the hypothalamus or posterior pituitary (eg, head trauma, transsphenoidal neurosurgery, suprasellar masses) can result in central diabetes insipidus (DI).

There are 4 major @dopaminergic pathways@ in the brain (eg, mesolimbic, mesocortical, tuberoinfundibular, nigrostriatal); dopamine hyperactivity in the mesolimbic pathway is associated with positive psychotic symptoms (eg hallucinations, delusions). $The side effects of antipsychotic therapy are largely caused by D2 receptor blockade in other dopaminergic pathways.  The #tuberoinfundibular pathway# connects the hypothalamus to the pituitary gland and is responsible for the tonic inhibition of prolactin secretion.  Neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus secrete dopamine, which binds to D2 receptors on pituitary lactotrophs, resulting in decreased prolactin secretion from the anterior pituitary gland.  Antipsychotics can interrupt the tuberoinfundibular pathway, causing increased blood prolactin levels #(hyperprolactinemia)#, which may lead to #galactorrhea# (milky nipple discharge unrelated to pregnancy/breastfeeding) and menstrual irregularities (eg, #amenorrhea#). $(Choice A)  The arcuate fasciculus is a neural pathway that connects the Broca and Wernicke areas, which are responsible for expressive and receptive language, respectively.  Disruption of the arcuate fasciculus classically results in conduction aphasia, characterized by fluent speech, intact comprehension, and impaired repetition. $(Choice B)  The hypothalamospinal tract projects from the hypothalamus to the ciliospinal center of the intermediolateral cell column (T1-L2), providing sympathetic innervation to the ipsilateral eye and face.  Disruption of this tract typically results in ipsilateral Horner syndrome (eg, ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis).  $(Choice C)  The lateral medullary spinothalamic tract transmits pain and temperature signals from the contralateral body to the thalamus.  Lateral medullary infarction (Wallenberg syndrome) presents with loss of pain and temperature sensation on the contralateral body and ipsilateral face as well as vertigo, hoarseness, dysphagia, and abnormal eye movements.$(Choice D)  The therapeutic effect of antipsychotics arises from blockade D2 receptors in the mesolimbic pathway.$(Choice E)  The nigrostriatal pathway projects from the substantia nigra to the caudate nucleus and putamen and primarily regulates the coordination of voluntary movements.  D2 receptor blockade in this pathway results in extrapyramidal effects (eg, dystonia, akathisia, tardive dyskinesia) and drug-induced parkinsonism. $Educational objective Antipsychotic medications work by blocking dopamine-2 receptors in the mesolimbic dopamine pathway.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient has urinary incontinence.  Continence is maintained by the bladder (detrusor muscle) and external and internal urinary sphincters.  The #external urinary sphincter# (EUS) is a skeletal muscle that receives somatic motor innervation (voluntary control) from the perineal branches of the #pudendal nerve# (S2-S4).  In contrast, the bladder and internal urethral sphincter (IUS) receive autonomic innervation: Sympathetic stimulation promotes urine storage and continence by increasing IUS tone and inhibiting detrusor contractions, and parasympathetic activity relaxes IUS tone and stimulates detrusor contractions, thereby promoting micturition. $ #Stress incontinence# is the leakage of urine with @increased intraabdominal pressure@ (eg, coughing).  A common cause is urethral sphincter dysfunction, which usually occurs in women with multiple #prior vaginal deliveries#.  Vaginal delivery is associated with obstetric trauma, which can cause urethral sphincter injury or pudendal nerve injury that contributes to decreased EUS tone.  Because of #low urethral sphincter tone# and increasing pelvic floor laxity with age, sudden increases in intraabdominal pressure (eg, coughing, sneezing) can cause the pressure within the bladder to exceed the urethral closing pressure.  This leads to #intermittent leakage# of urine. $#(Choices A, B, and D)#  Bladder outlet obstruction (eg, tumor obstructing the urethra) and detrusor muscle inactivity (often secondary to diabetic autonomic neuropathy) both lead to urinary retention.  In patients with urinary retention, urine slowly accumulates in the bladder until the intravesical pressure exceeds the urethral closing pressure, causing leakage.  Because urine is constantly accumulating in the bladder, patients have persistent involuntary dribbling of urine (overflow incontinence) rather than urine leakage with cough.  In addition, this patient's normal neurologic examination with no associated numbness or orthostatic hypotension makes diabetic autonomic neuropathy unlikely. $(Choice C)  Detrusor overactivity is the underlying mechanism of urge incontinence, which typically presents with a sudden urge to urinate followed by the immediate, involuntary loss of urine.  This patient's incontinence episodes typically follow an abrupt increase in intraabdominal pressure (eg, coughing, sneezing), making urge incontinence less likely. $ Educational objective Stress incontinence, involuntary leakage of urine with increased intraabdominal pressure, can occur due to urethral sphincter dysfunction (eg, decreased sphincter tone).  Risk factors include multiple prior vaginal deliveries, which can injure the external urethral sphincter or pudendal nerve.",

In addition to postvoid dribbling and frequent urinary tract infections, hematuria can occur in this condition but would be present only in the urethra, not in the bladder or ureters. $ Educational objective The bladder trigone is formed by 2 slit-like ureteric orifices and the internal urethral opening.  Blood within the ureteric orifice suggests upper urinary tract bleeding originating in the kidney (eg, renal papillary necrosis) or ureter.",

  "explanation_2": "$This patient's loss of urine with increased intraabdominal pressure (eg, coughing, sneezing) is due to #stress urinary incontinence# (SUI).  The bladder and urethra are typically maintained in a normal anatomic position by the pelvic floor muscles known as the #levator ani muscle complex# (ie, iliococcygeus, pubococcygeus, puborectalis), which form a U-shaped sling around the pelvic viscera for pelvic support. $Patients develop SUI due to chronic pressure (eg, obesity) or injury (eg, #multiple vaginal deliveries#) affecting the levator ani muscle complex, which results in #pelvic floor weakness# and laxity.  Chronic pelvic floor laxity contributes to #urethral hypermobility#, in which the pelvic floor muscles cannot stabilize and fully compress (close) the urethra against the anterior vaginal wall during times of increased intraabdominal pressure (eg, coughing).  Pelvic floor weakness can also lead to herniation of the bladder into the vagina and #anterior vaginal wall prolapse# (cystocele). $First-line treatment of SUI is #pelvic floor muscle (Kegel) exercises#, which repeatedly activate and release the levator ani muscle complex to gradually strengthen and stabilize the pelvic floor.  The strengthened pelvic musculature provides a stable base for urethral compression, thereby maintaining continence. $#(Choice A)#  The @bulbospongiosus muscle@ is part of the superficial urogenital triangle of the perineum.  It constricts the vaginal orifice and is commonly damaged during @vaginal delivery@.  Because it is a superficial muscle, strengthening it does not improve pelvic floor support or reduce SUI. $#(Choices B and C)#  Detrusor muscle overactivity results in @urge incontinence@ (eg, the sudden need to urinate followed by immediate, involuntary loss of urine) rather than SUI, while stimulation of the internal urethral sphincter helps prevent urine leakage.  Both are smooth muscles (ie, controlled by the autonomic nervous system); therefore, they cannot be voluntarily exercised for symptom improvement. $#(Choice E)#  The uterosacral ligaments run along the lateral pelvic wall and elevate the uterus and vaginal apex by attaching to the sacrum.  Weakening of these ligaments contributes to uterine prolapse but does not directly cause SUI or anterior vaginal wall prolapse. $#Educational objective# Stress urinary incontinence is involuntary urine leakage with increased intraabdominal pressure (eg, coughing, sneezing).  Pelvic floor muscle (Kegel) exercises target and strengthen the levator ani muscle complex, improving support around the urethra and bladder and symptoms of stress urinary incontinence. ",

Patients with #repeat cesarean deliveries# commonly have an anterior, low transverse scar; therefore, placental implantation in future pregnancies is typically anterior and low, which can result in the placenta covering the internal cervical os (ie, @placenta previa@).

Shearing of these veins, which connect veins of the scalp to the meningeal veins and dural sinuses, leads to hemorrhage in the potential space between the #periosteum# and #galea aponeurosis# (subgaleal space). $This potential space extends over the whole calvaria and into the neck.
