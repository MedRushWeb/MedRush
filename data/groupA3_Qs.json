This benign, autosomal recessive disorder causes some of the dietary fructose load to be secreted in the urine unchanged due to defective metabolism by #fructokinase#.  Fructose, similar to glucose and galactose, is a #reducing sugar# and can be detected by a #copper reduction test#, which nonspecifically detects the presence of reducing sugar.  A urine dipstick, however, uses glucose oxidase to ascertain the presence of urinary glucose and will not test positive in the presence of fructose or galactose. $#(Choice A)#  Acid α-glucosidase (or acid maltase) deficiency causes glycogen storage disease type II (Pompe disease).  Affected infants have cardiomyopathy, muscle weakness, and hypotonia. $#(Choice B)#  Aldolase B deficiency is a life-threatening disorder caused by the inability to metabolize fructose-1-phosphate (a toxic intermediate that accumulates in cells and depletes intracellular phosphate).  Patients become acutely symptomatic after ingesting fructose-containing foods and eventually develop liver failure.  Treatment includes elimination of dietary fructose. $#(Choice D)#  Galactosemia is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase deficiency.  It is characterized by neonatal jaundice, vomiting, cataract formation, hepatomegaly, and failure to thrive.  Treatment includes elimination of all milk products from the diet and feeding with soy-based infant formula. $#(Choice E)#  Lactase is a mucosal enzyme responsible for the digestion of lactose.  Acquired lactase deficiency is the most common cause of selective carbohydrate malabsorption.  Patients with lactase deficiency experience gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, bloating, diarrhea) following the ingestion of dairy products. $#Educational objective# Unlike hereditary fructose intolerance (aldolase B deficiency) and classic galactosemia (galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase deficiency), essential fructosuria (fructokinase deficiency) is a benign disorder.  Although affected patients are asymptomatic, their urine will test positive for a reducing sugar due to the presence of unmetabolized fructose.  "

Fructose is absorbed in the proximal intestine through the GLUT5 fructose transporter.

In fructokinase deficiency, #hexokinase# takes over the role of fructose metabolism, converting dietary fructose into #fructose-6-phosphate#.  Fructose-6-phosphate can be metabolized in the glycolytic pathway or converted to glucose-6-phosphate or glucose-1-phosphate, which can be used in the pentose phosphate pathway or for glycogen synthesis, respectively. $#(Choice A)#  Aldolase B plays a nonessential role in glycolysis due to the redundant function of aldolase A.  However, it is particularly important during fructose metabolism as deficiency of this enzyme leads to toxic accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate (hereditary fructose intolerance).  This life-threatening disorder presents in infancy after the introduction of fructose-containing foods. $#(Choice B)#  @Aldose reductase@ is the enzyme that converts glucose to sorbitol.  Aldose reductase has a low affinity for glucose, and normally only very small amounts of glucose are metabolized by this enzyme.  The amount of glucose metabolized by the aldose reductase pathway increases significantly in diabetes mellitus and contributes to chronic complications such as neuropathy and retinopathy. $#(Choice E)#  UDP-galactose-4-epimerase is involved in the metabolism of @galactose@; it does not play a role in fructose metabolism. $#Educational objective# Essential fructosuria is a benign disorder of fructose metabolism caused by fructokinase deficiency.  In patients with essential fructosuria, some of the dietary fructose load is converted by hexokinase to fructose-6-phosphate, which can then enter glycolysis; this pathway is not significant in normal individuals.

The proteasome recognizes ubiquitinated proteins and uses ATP energy to drive the proteins through its tubular structure, degrading them into small peptides; attachment of 4 or more ubiquitin monomers is typically required before #proteasomal degradation# can take place.  Ubiquitination plays a role in many cell functions requiring the breakdown of specific proteins, including antigen processing, muscle wasting, cell cycle regulation, and# #disposal of #misfolded proteins#. $#Impairment# of the ubiquitin-proteasome system can contribute to the development of neurodegenerative disorders (eg, Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease).  Failure to properly degrade abnormal proteins can cause #aggregation# of misfolded proteins and eventual obstruction of intracellular molecular traffic, leading to cell death.

Hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins can contribute to abnormal protein aggregation in Alzheimer disease, not Parkinson disease. $#Educational objective# Ubiquitin is a protein that undergoes attachment to other proteins, labeling them for degradation by proteasomes.

  "explanation_2": "$During @gluconeogenesis@, substances such as lactate and alanine are converted to pyruvate.  However, pyruvate cannot be converted to phosphoenolpyruvate directly as pyruvate kinase is unidirectional.  To convert pyruvate to phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate first undergoes biotin-dependent carboxylation to oxaloacetate in the mitochondria.  This reaction is catalyzed by #pyruvate carboxylase#.  The activity of pyruvate carboxylase is increased by #acetyl-CoA#.  This critical regulatory step diverts pyruvate to pyruvate dehydrogenase when acetyl-CoA levels are too low, preventing the cell from becoming energy starved.  When acetyl-CoA levels are high (as with increased beta oxidation of fatty acids during fasting), pyruvate carboxylase can operate at full capacity and convert most of the pyruvate into oxaloacetate for use in gluconeogenesis. $#(Choice B)#  Muscle converts pyruvate to alanine via transamination, which is then transported to the liver where it is converted back to pyruvate for use in gluconeogenesis.  Alanine allosterically inhibits pyruvate kinase, preventing phosphoenolpyruvate from being consumed by glycolysis during the gluconeogenic state. $#(Choice C)#  Citrate is formed within mitochondria in the first reaction of the @Krebs cycle@, and elevated levels act as an indicator of high cellular energy stores and abundant biosynthetic intermediates.  Citrate is therefore an important positive regulator of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, key enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis and gluconeogenesis, respectively. $#(Choice D)#  Regulation of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis occurs mainly through the inverse regulation of phosphofructokinase-1 and fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate.  High levels of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate activate phosphofructokinase-1 and accelerate glycolysis; low levels disinhibit fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase and promote gluconeogenesis. $#(Choice E)#  Lactate is an important source of carbon atoms for glucose synthesis during gluconeogenesis.  During anaerobic glycolysis in skeletal muscle, pyruvate is reduced to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase.  Lactate formed in the contracting muscles is released into the bloodstream and transported to the liver, where it is converted back into glucose. $#(Choice F)#  Oxaloacetate is the product of pyruvate carboxylase during gluconeogenesis.  As such, increased levels of oxaloacetate would decrease the activity of the enzyme. $#Educational objective# Acetyl-CoA stimulates gluconeogenesis by increasing the activity of pyruvate carboxylase when acetyl-CoA is abundant.  This regulatory step allows pyruvate to be shunted toward acetyl-CoA production when acetyl-CoA levels are low, preventing the cell from becoming depleted of energy.  ",

Ras proteins exist in 2 different states: an #inactive GDP-bound state# and an #active GTP-bound state#.  Ras becomes activated when a growth factor ligand binds to a #receptor tyrosine kinase# located on the cell membrane, causing autophosphorylation of the receptor.  This triggers binding of adaptor proteins that interact with Ras, promoting GDP removal and GTP binding.  Activated Ras then begins a phosphorylation cascade that results in the activation of #mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)#, which enters the nucleus to influence gene transcription. $Ras proteins have intrinsic GTPase activity that allows them to hydrolyze GTP; this mechanism prevents accumulation of active Ras (GTP-bound) in the absence of hormonal signaling.  RAS gene mutations can lead to decreased intrinsic GTPase activity; this results in a constitutively activated Ras protein that causes constant and unregulated cell proliferation.

The prognosis is generally good, and symptoms can be improved by #consuming simple sugars# before beginning physical activity. $During @glycogenolysis@, glycogen phosphorylase shortens glycogen chains by cleaving 1,4-alpha-glycosidic linkages between glucose residues, liberating glucose-1-phosphate in the process.

The membrane prevents the free diffusion of ions, and generally there is an excess of positive ions outside the cell and an excess of negative ions in the cytoplasm.  This separation of positive and negative charges across the cell membrane gives rise to an electrical potential difference that ranges from -60 to -80 mV; the typical resting membrane potential of a cell is -70 mV. $The cytoplasm of a typical cell is characterized by a low concentration of Na and high concentration of K.  The extracellular fluid is inversely rich in Na and low in K.  This difference in Na and K concentration is maintained by the Na,K-ATPase, which pumps three Na ions out of the cell for every 2 K ions allowed into the cell. $Every charged ion that the cell membrane is permeable attempts to push the resting membrane potential of the cell toward its equilibrium potential.  The resting membrane potential can therefore be viewed as a combination of the equilibrium potentials of the ions that can penetrate the cell membrane.  Each permeable ion does not contribute equally to the membrane potential; it is obvious that the resting membrane potential does not equal the average of the different equilibrium potentials.  The greater the permeability of a given ion, the greater its contribution to the resting membrane potential will be.  Ions with little permeability will contribute very little to the resting membrane potential.  In the resting cell the permeability of the membrane for K is much higher than that for Na.  Outflow of K ions through non-gated channels maintains the negative charge inside the membrane, which approaches the equilibrium potential for K.  There are, however, a small number of channels that allow the flow of Na into the cell.  This small influx of Na ions decreases the membrane potential, and for this reason the resting potential of the membrane is always less negative than the equilibrium potential for K #(choice A).# $#(Choice B)#  If the chloride equilibrium potential is -70 mV and the resting membrane potential is -70 mV, then chloride would need to be the only membrane permeable ion with no contribution from other ions.  Chloride, in reality, plays little role in the determination of the membrane potential. $#(Choice C)#  High calcium conductance would make the resting membrane potential positive, and the question stem states that the membrane potential is -70 mV. $#(Choice D)#  High potassium conductance does occur at rest and is the largest contributor to the resting membrane potential.  Chloride plays little to no role in the determination of the resting membrane potential. $#(Choice E)#  If a high potassium conductance were the only contributor to the resting membrane potential, then the membrane potential would be the same as the potassium equilibrium potential. $#Educational objective# The resting membrane potential is the difference in the electrical charges across the cell membrane under steady-state conditions.  The ions that are most permeable to the cell membrane make the largest contribution to the resting membrane potential.

  "explanation_2": "In the #well-fed state#, the abundance of ATP in hepatocytes inhibits isocitrate dehydrogenase, leading to high levels of citrate in the mitochondria.  Citrate is transferred to the cytosol via the citrate shuttle and cleaved by ATP citrate lyase to form acetyl-CoA.  High citrate levels (in addition to elevated insulin caused by high carbohydrate intake) causes upregulation of #Acetyl-CoA carboxylase#.  This cytosolic enzyme catalyzes the conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA in the rate-limiting step of de novo #fatty acid synthesis#.  Fatty acid synthase then catalyzes the condensation of malonyl-CoA with acetyl-CoA to create a 4-carbon molecule that will undergo subsequent condensation reactions to form a 16-carbon fatty acid. $#Beta-oxidation# of fatty acids takes place primarily within the #mitochondrial matrix#.  Mitochondrial membranes are impermeable to fatty acids due to their negative charge, so a specialized membrane carrier (#carnitine#) must be used to shuttle them into the matrix.  #Malonyl-CoA inhibits carnitine acyltransferase#, preventing the transfer of acyl groups into the mitochondria.  This inhibitory action functions to prevent the breakdown of newly synthesized fatty acids. $#(Choice A)#  Ketone bodies (eg, acetoacetate) are a major source of fuel for muscle, brain, and cardiac tissue that are produced during times of starvation or fasting when oxaloacetate is in short supply and acetyl-CoA is in excess. $#(Choice B)#  Carnitine is an amino acid that is essential for the transport of fatty acids through the mitochondrial membrane.  It is a necessary component of fatty acid oxidation. $#(Choice C)#  Citrate is an intermediate in the TCA cycle.  It can be exported out of the mitochondrial matrix and into the cytosol, where it is broken down into acetyl-CoA for use in de novo fatty acid synthesis. $#(Choice E)#  NADPH is a reducing molecule necessary for the synthesis of fatty acids.  In contrast, beta-oxidation of fats produces FADH2 and NADH-reducing equivalents. $#Educational objective# Cytosolic acetyl-CoA carboxylase converts acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA during the rate-limiting step of de novo fatty acid synthesis.  Malonyl-CoA also inhibits the action of mitochondrial carnitine acyltransferase, thereby inhibiting beta-oxidation of newly formed fatty acids.  "

  "explanation_2": "$This child likely has #Ehlers-Danlos syndrome#, a group of rare hereditary disorders characterized by #defective collagen synthesis#.  The condition can be caused by a #deficiency# in #procollagen peptidase#, the enzyme that cleaves terminal propeptides from procollagen in the extracellular space.  Impaired propeptide removal results in the formation of soluble collagen that does not properly crosslink.  Consequently, patients often have joint laxity, #hyperextensible skin, fragile tissue# with easy bruising, and poor wound healing. $Each collagen molecule consists of 3 polypeptide α-chains held together by hydrogen bonds, forming a triple helix.  Collagen assumes this conformation because each of the α-chains has a simple, repetitive amino acid sequence represented as (Gly-X-Y)n.  The smallest amino acid, glycine (Gly), is necessary at every third position to ensure compact coiling of the helix.  Many of the amino acids represented by X and Y are proline residues, which kink the polypeptide chain and enhance the rigidity of the helical structure due to their ring configuration. $Mature collagen is synthesized by fibroblasts, osteoblasts, and chondroblasts through the following steps:  $1. As translation begins in the cytoplasm, an amino acid signal sequence at the N-terminus of the α-chain facilitates ribosomal binding to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and passage of the growing polypeptide chain (pre-pro-α-chain) into the RER.  $2. Inside the RER, the hydrophobic signal sequence is cleaved to yield the pro-α-chain.  Proline and lysine at the Y positions of the pro-α-chain are hydroxylated to hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine, respectively #(choice D).#  Glycosylation of select hydroxylysine residues also occurs within the RER #(choice A).#  $3. The central helical region of the pro-α-chain is flanked by N- and C-terminal propeptides.  Disulfide bond formation between the C-terminal propeptide region of 3 α-chains brings the chains into an alignment favorable for assembly into a triple helix (procollagen molecule) #(choices B and E)#.  $4. Procollagen molecules are then transported through the Golgi apparatus into the extracellular space.  The N- and C-terminal propeptides are cleaved by procollagen peptidases, converting procollagen into less soluble tropocollagen.  $5. Tropocollagen monomers self-assemble into collagen fibrils.  Finally, lysyl oxidase helps create covalent crosslinks between collagen fibrils to form strong collagen fibers. $#Educational objective# Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a group of rare hereditary disorders characterized by defective collagen synthesis.  It can be caused by procollagen peptidase deficiency, which results in impaired cleavage of terminal propeptides in the extracellular space.  Patients often have joint laxity, hyperextensible skin, and tissue fragility due to the formation of soluble collagen that does not properly crosslink.  "

The condition is caused by a defect in the protein responsible for carnitine transport across the mitochondrial membrane.  Without sufficient carnitine, fatty acids cannot be transported from the cytoplasm into the mitochondria as acyl-carnitine (carnitine shuttle).  The mitochondria therefore cannot β-oxidize the fatty acids into acetyl CoA, the carbon substrate for the citric acid cycle.  As a result, cardiac and skeletal myocytes cannot generate ATP from fatty acids (leading to muscle weakness, cardiomyopathy) and the liver is unable to synthesize #ketone bodies# (manifests as hypoketotic hypoglycemia). $Hypoketotic hypoglycemia is also seen in other fatty acid oxidation disorders (eg, acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency). $#(Choice B)#  Arachidonic acid can be ingested or synthesized from phospholipids in the cell membrane.

Palmitate synthesis occurs in the cytosol and would not be affected by carnitine deficiency. $#Educational objective# Carnitine deficiency impairs fatty acid transport from the cytoplasm into mitochondria, preventing β-oxidation of fatty acids into acetyl CoA.

Subsequently, the conversion of homocysteine to cystathionine requires the enzyme cystathionine synthase, the amino acid serine, and the cofactor vitamin B6.  Cystathionine is then converted to cysteine by the enzyme cystathionase, which also requires vitamin B6 as a cofactor.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient has #inclusion cell (I-cell) disease#, an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder.  I-cell disease occurs due to defects in protein targeting, a process by which proteins are transported to their appropriate intra- or extracellular location. $Normally, posttranslational modifications (eg, folding, glycosylation, phosphorylation) function as markers that help guide proteins to their final destination.  For #lysosome-bound proteins# (ie, acid hydrolases), a Golgi body phosphotransferase enzyme catalyzes the phosphorylation of mannose residues on the proteins.  Once #tagged with mannose-6-phosphate#, these proteins traverse the Golgi network and are ultimately transported to the lysosome, where they serve as catalysts for degradation of cellular components. $In I-cell disease, a #defective phosphotransferase enzyme# results in deficient phosphorylation (ie, incorrect targeting) of mannose residues on acid hydrolases, which are then #inappropriately secreted# to the extracellular space.  This leads to lack of degradation of lysosomal cellular debris, which accumulates within the lysosome, forming the characteristic inclusion bodies.  Patients with this disorder typically have failure to thrive, respiratory tract infections, and cognitive deficits in the first year of life, along with characteristic physical features (eg, coarse facies, corneal clouding, hepatosplenomegaly). $#(Choice A)#  The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the site of protein synthesis prior to transport to the Golgi apparatus for protein modification and vesicular trafficking.  Retrograde transport from the Golgi apparatus to the ER occurs via specialized protein-coated vesicles (eg, COPI). $#(Choice B)#  Following translation in the ER, secretory proteins traverse the Golgi apparatus and are packaged into vesicles that ultimately fuse with the plasma membrane, facilitating extracellular protein secretion.  Lysosomal proteins are inappropriately transferred to the extracellular space in patients with I-cell disease. $#(Choice D)#  Most mitochondrial proteins are synthesized in the cytosol and contain specific mitochondrial targeting sequences.  Translocases detect these sequences and shuttle the proteins into and between the different mitochondrial compartments. $#(Choice E)#  Peripheral membrane proteins may be modified through a process in which a hydrophobic lipid anchor is covalently attached to the protein.  This process facilitates protein interaction with the plasma membrane. $#Educational objective# Inclusion cell disease is a lysosomal storage disorder in which a defect in protein targeting prevents the phosphorylation of mannose residues required to tag acid hydrolases for transport to lysosomes.  Without these lysosomal proteins, cellular debris cannot be degraded and therefore accumulates within lysosomes, forming inclusion bodies characteristic of the disease.  "

  "explanation_2": "$This patient's neurologic abnormalities (eg, tremors, seizures) in the setting of musty body odor and light skin/eye color are suggestive of #phenylketonuria# (PKU), an autosomal recessive disease in which patients have impaired metabolism of phenylalanine, an essential amino acid.  PKU is caused by deficiency of #phenylalanine hydroxylase#, which catalyzes the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine. $Most patients with PKU are identified via routine newborn screening (ie, via elevated phenylalanine levels) and treated with a #phenylalanine-restricted diet# starting in the neonatal period #(choice D).#  This diet is typically sufficient to prevent manifestations of disease, which are largely due to hyperphenylalaninemia.  However, tyrosine is considered an essential amino acid in patients with PKU because it cannot be synthesized from phenylalanine and is required for the production of proteins, catecholamines, and melanin.  Therefore, although tyrosine is usually available in a well-varied diet, #tyrosine supplementation# may be required if intake is insufficient. $Without treatment, hyperphenylalaninemia results in the following findings: $• #Irreversible neurologic injury#:  Excess phenylalanine is thought to affect normal neuronal development and increase oxidative stress in the brain, leading to developmental delay, intellectual disability, microcephaly, and seizures. $• #Reduced melanin# production (eg, light skin, blue eyes):  Excess levels of phenylalanine inhibit tyrosinase, an enzyme essential in the production of melanin.  Low levels of tyrosine also contribute to hypopigmentation in patients who are tyrosine deficient. $• #Musty odor#:  Excess phenylalanine metabolites cause malodorous breath, skin, and urine. $#(Choice A)#  Cysteine supplementation may be required in homocystinuria, a condition in which cystathionine synthase deficiency leads to reduced cysteine production and @homocysteine and methionine@ accumulation.  Fair complexion and seizures may be seen in infancy; other characteristic features (eg, downward lens dislocation, thrombosis) usually present later.  However, musty body odor would not be expected. $#(Choices B, C, and F)#  The branched-chain amino acids (isoleucine, leucine, valine) are elevated in maple syrup urine disease, which is due to branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase deficiency.  Buildup of branched-chain amino acids and their metabolites leads to ketonuria (urine with a sweet odor) and encephalopathy within a week of birth; management is dietary restriction of these amino acids. $#Educational objective# Untreated phenylketonuria leads to irreversible neurologic abnormalities (eg, intellectual disability, seizures), as well as reduced melanin production and a musty odor.  Pathophysiology involves impaired metabolism of phenylalanine to tyrosine, and treatment includes a phenylalanine-restricted diet that may require supplemental tyrosine.  ",

Her late presentation, normal growth, and the isolated presence of cataracts are particularly suggestive of #galactokinase (GALK) deficiency#. $After lactose is broken down to galactose and glucose, galactose is normally phosphorylated to galactose-1-phosphate by GALK.  Deficiency causes galactose buildup and this excess is converted to #galactitol#, an osmotic agent that causes #cataracts#.  Excess galactose also spills into the urine and causes it to test positive for a reducing substance. $#Serious systemic manifestations# are typically #not seen# in GALK deficiency, and @cataracts@ are frequently the only manifestation (some developmental milestones [eg, social smile] may be impacted if they occur early in life).  In contrast, galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (#GALT#) #deficiency# results in a #more serious# form of galactosemia.  This is related to the accumulation of galactose-1-phosphate, a toxic metabolite that causes hepatic and renal dysfunction; patients with GALT deficiency present early, in the neonatal period, with vomiting, lethargy, and failure to thrive. $#(Choice A)#  Patients with @aldolase B deficiency@ (hereditary fructose intolerance) cannot metabolize fructose and develop hypoglycemia, hypophosphatemia, and failure to thrive.

Examples include α1-adrenergic, M1 and M3 cholinergic, V1 (vasopressin), H1 (histamine), oxytocin, angiotensin II, TRH, and GnRH receptors.  This signal transduction pathway proceeds through the following steps:  $1. Binding of a ligand to its cell surface receptor causes the #exchange of GDP for GTP# on the α-subunit of a #Gq-protein# associated with the receptor.  The activated α-subunit undergoes a conformational change and exposes a #phospholipase C# (PLC) activating site.  $2.

Levels can also increase following cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase inhibition, as seen on exposure to sildenafil, which selectively inhibits cGMP phosphodiesterease and results in smooth muscle relaxation in blood vessels. $#(Choice D)#  Intracellular Cl- concentration increases slightly after inhibitory neurotransmitters (eg, GABA, glycine) act on the neuron to increase Cl- membrane conductance (hyperpolarization). $#(Choice E)#  The intracellular concentration of mRNA increases during cellular states of elevated protein synthesis (eg, during cell division). $#(Choice F)#  Nitric oxide (NO) is a paracrine signaling molecule with a lifetime of a few seconds.  It can freely cross cell membranes and functions as a critical component of endothelium-mediated vasodilation.  NO is synthesized from arginine and O2 by the enzyme NO-synthase. $#Educational objective# The phosphoinositol second messenger system begins with ligand-receptor binding and Gq-protein activation leading to activation of phospholipase C (PLC).  PLC then hydrolyzes phosphatidyl inositol bisphosphate and forms diacylglycerol and inositol triphosphate (IP3).  Finally, IP3 activates protein kinase C via an increase in intracellular Ca2+.  "

Regulation of protein expression occurs at multiple levels, as follows: $•  Transcriptional:  mRNA production rate is determined by the binding of transcription factors.  Genetic changes (eg, alterations in promoter sequence) and epigenetic modifications that affect chromatin openness (eg, histone methylation or acetylation) can also affect the rate of gene transcription by altering access and binding of transcription factors and RNA polymerase.  Alterations of transcription factors themselves (eg, mutations, abnormal expression) can also affect the downstream expression of their myriad gene targets.  However, transcriptional regulation results in altered mRNA levels #(choices A and B)#. $•  Posttranscriptional:  After the gene is transcribed, the pre-mRNA undergoes further processing and regulation.  Posttranscriptional control regulates the rate of mRNA decay.  Examples of posttranscriptional control include polyadenylation and RNA interference (eg, endogenous microRNAs).  The poly(A) tail protects eukaryotic mRNA from digestion by endogenous ribonucleases.  Therefore, truncation of the poly(A) tail leads to increased mRNA degradation and lower mRNA abundance #(choice C).# $•  Posttranslational:  After translation of mRNA, the polypeptide product undergoes #posttranslational modifications# (PTMs), which can affect both protein abundance and activity.

  "explanation_2": "$The extracellular matrix is a network of interstitial proteins that maintain normal tissue architecture.  #Collagen# is a major component of #connective tissue# and consists of 3 polypeptide α chains held together by #hydrogen bonds# to form a ropelike triple helix structure (tropocollagen).  #Lysyl oxidase# then forms covalent bonds between individual tropocollagen molecules, generating mature collagen fibers.  The variation in amino acid sequences in the collagen α chains gives rise to collagen diversity in different tissues.  Collagen types I, II, III, and V provide #tensile strength# in skin, bones, cartilage, tendons, and blood vessels. $#Ehlers-Danlos syndrome# (EDS) is a group of hereditary disorders involving a defect in collagen synthesis.  EDS usually manifests clinically as #hypermobile# #joints#, #overelastic# #skin#, and fragile tissue susceptible to bruising, wounds, and hemarthrosis.  Common mutations leading to EDS phenotypes include deficiencies of the lysyl hydroxylase and procollagen peptidase enzymes responsible for collagen synthesis. $#(Choice B)#  Elastin, a fibrous protein in the connective tissue, is named for the elastic properties it imparts to skin, blood vessels, and lung alveoli.  Elastin fibers can be stretched to several times their original length but will recoil when the stretching forces are withdrawn.  Elastin is synthesized from the polypeptide precursor tropoelastin. $#(Choice C)#  Fibrillin-1 is a major component of the microfibrils that form a sheath around elastin.  Microfibrils are abundantly present in blood vessels and in the suspensory ligaments of the lens.  Defects in the fibrillin-1 gene cause classic autosomal dominant Marfan syndrome. $#(Choice D)#  Hyaluronic acid is another major component of the soft tissue's extracellular matrix, including synovial fluid and skin.  Exogenous injection can be used to restore viscoelasticity to the synovial fluid in osteoarthritis; soft-tissue fillers can also be used in patients concerned about age-related volume loss (eg, nasolabial folds). $#(Choice E)#  Laminins are heterotrimeric glycoproteins that bind to type IV collagen underlying epithelial cells.  They contribute to the organization and function of the basal lamina (basement membrane). $#(Choice F)#  Proteoglycans are composed of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), which provide compressibility to tissues.  Patients with deficiencies in lysosomal enzymes cannot break down GAGs, resulting in mucopolysaccharidoses (eg, Hurler syndrome, Hunter syndrome) characterized by soft tissue and skeletal disease. $#Educational objective# Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a heritable connective tissue disease associated with abnormal collagen formation.  EDS usually manifests clinically as overflexible (hypermobile) joints, overelastic (hyperelastic) skin, and fragile tissue susceptible to bruising, wounding, and hemarthrosis.  "

  "explanation_2": "The two primary modes of cell death are necrosis (which is induced by injury) and apoptosis (which is initiated by the host organism in response to cell damage, age-related atrophy, or specific stages of embryogenesis).  Apoptosis is helpful in the elimination of cells that are no longer necessary and in the maintenance of a constant number of cells in rapidly growing tissues.  Tumor cells, for example, die by apoptosis.  The death of B and T lymphocytes and virally-infected cells also occurs through apoptosis.  The remains of cells that die by this method are phagocytized by macrophages. $The process of apoptosis involves the following steps:  $1. Initiation: Apoptosis is triggered by different stimuli and can occur through either the intrinsic, mitochondria-mediated pathway or the extrinsic, receptor-initiated pathway.  Cells damaged by ultraviolet light, heat, hypoxia, toxins, or radiation display intrinsic apoptotic signals (eg, phosphatidylserine or thrombospondin) on their plasma membranes.  Extrinsic apoptosis, in contrast, is induced by the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) when bound to tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) or the Fas ligand when bound to cell surface receptor Fas.  $2. Control: Intrinsic apoptosis is mediated by a group of bcl-2 proteins.  Some of the components of this system are pro-apoptotic (eg, Bak, Bax, and Bim proteins), while others are anti-apoptotic (eg, Bcl-x and Bcl-2 proteins).  Apoptotic signals tip the balance between these two forces, resulting in changes of the inner mitochondrial membrane.  These changes are responsible for the formation of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) and the release of cytochrome c and other pro-apoptotic proteins into the cytoplasm, which then activate caspases.  In extrinsic apoptosis, the binding of the death ligand and the death receptor allows for pro-caspase molecules to be brought into close proximity.  $3. Destruction: Both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways converge at this step, resulting in caspase activation.  Caspases are proteolytic enzymes that destroy cell components.  They contain cysteine and are able to cleave aspartic acid residues (#c#ysteine-#asp#artic-acid-prote#ases#).  The eleven caspases that have been identified are classified as either initiator or effector caspases.  Initiator caspases activate the effector caspases, which then cleave the cellular proteins. $#(Choice A)#  Metalloproteinases are zinc-containing enzymes that degrade the components of the extracellular matrix (eg, collagen, laminin, fibronectin).  Metalloproteinases are essential for proper tissue remodeling during wound healing. $#(Choice B)#  Acid hydrolases do not participate in apoptosis. $#(Choice D)#  Phospholipase A2 does not participate in apoptosis. $#(Choice E)#  Protein kinase A is a component of the cAMP-associated signaling system.  The binding of a ligand to a G-protein-linked receptor results in adenylyl cyclase activation and the release of cAMP.  Elevated levels of cAMP activate protein kinase A. $#Educational objective# Apoptosis can occur through either the intrinsic (mitochondria-mediated) pathway or the extrinsic (receptor-initiated) pathway.  Both pathways converge in the activation of caspases.  Caspases are proteolytic enzymes that cleave cellular proteins.  "

  "explanation_2": "$Alanine and glutamine play an important role in transporting nitrogen throughout the body.  Glutamine is produced by most body tissues and is catabolized primarily by the gut and kidney for maintenance of cellular metabolism and acid-base regulation, respectively.  A significant portion of the glutamine used by these tissues is converted to alanine and released into the circulation.  Alanine is also released by skeletal muscle tissue during protein catabolism as part of the @glucose-alanine cycle@ that helps remove excess nitrogen.  Alanine is then transported to the liver, where it serves as a vehicle for nitrogen disposal and as a source of carbon skeletons for gluconeogenesis. $In the liver, alanine is transaminated by alanine aminotransferase to pyruvate with the amino group being transferred to α-ketoglutarate to form glutamate.  Almost all aminotransferase enzymes use α-ketoglutarate as the amino group acceptor.  Thus, amino groups are funneled into glutamate during protein catabolism.  Glutamate is further metabolized by the enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase, which liberates free ammonia and regenerates α-ketoglutarate.  Ammonia then enters the urea cycle to form urea, the primary disposal form of nitrogen in humans.  Urea subsequently enters the blood and is excreted in the urine. $#(Choices C, D, and E)#  Malate, citrate, and oxaloacetate are all intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. $#(Choice B)#  L-citrulline is an amino acid produced as an intermediate in the conversion of ornithine to argininosuccinate during the hepatic urea cycle. $#Educational objective# Alanine is the major amino acid responsible for transferring nitrogen to the liver for disposal.

  "explanation_2": "$Ammonia generated from the metabolism of amino acids is converted into urea by the urea cycle.  The combination of bicarbonate (HCO3-), ammonia, and ATP is catalyzed by carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (rate-limiting enzyme in the urea cycle) to yield carbamoyl phosphate.  Carbamoyl phosphate combines with ornithine to form citrulline in a reaction catalyzed by ornithine transcarbamylase.  Citrulline enters the cytosol and is converted to argininosuccinate, which is then converted to arginine.  The conversion of arginine to ornithine by arginase completes the urea cycle by releasing a urea molecule.  N-acetylglutamate serves as a regulator of the urea cycle through activation of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I. $This patient most likely has #ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency#, the most common urea cycle disorder.  OTC deficiency results in excess carbamoyl phosphate, which stimulates pyrimidine synthesis.  As an intermediate product in this pathway, orotic acid accumulates and results in #increased urinary orotic acid#. $Patients also have #hyperammonemia# due to impaired ammonia excretion, which is a #metabolic emergency#.  Ammonia is neurotoxic and causes #episodes of vomiting and confusion/coma#.  #Tachypnea# also occurs due to cerebral edema from ammonia buildup, resulting in central hyperventilation and respiratory alkalosis.  Metabolic decompensation is often triggered by illness (eg, viral upper respiratory infection, acute otitis media), fasting, or increased protein intake. $#(Choices A and C)#  Although defects in carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I and N-Acetylglutamate synthetase also result in hyperammonemia, levels of carbamoyl phosphate are low and orotic acid is not elevated in the urine. $#(Choice B)#  Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency (Lesch-Nyhan syndrome) results in hyperuricemia because purines cannot be salvaged from degraded DNA.  Urate kidney stones and self-mutilation are classic clinical manifestations. $#(Choice E)#  Uridine monophosphate synthetase (UMPS) is part of the pyrimidine synthesis pathway.  UMPS deficiency leads to orotic acid buildup (similar to OTC deficiency) but not hyperammonemia.  Characteristic findings include megaloblastic anemia and delayed growth. $#Educational objective# Patients with urea cycle disorders typically have discrete episodes of vomiting, tachypnea, and confusion/coma secondary to hyperammonemia (a metabolic emergency).

This patient with #celiac disease#, who is noncompliant with dietary restrictions, likely developed folate deficiency due to inflammation in the wall of the jejunum, which impaired folate absorption. $Folate has a crucial role in the generation of purines and pyrimidines by converting homocysteine to methionine.  Specifically, 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate donates its methyl group to vitamin B12, forming methylcobalamin, then methylcobalamin donates its methyl group to homocysteine to form methionine.  In folate deficiency, homocysteine cannot be converted to methionine, leading to homocysteine accumulation #(choice C).#  In contrast, #folate supplementation# results in the rapid conversion of homocysteine to methionine, leading to #low homocysteine# and #high methionine#. $#Methylmalonic acid# is a biomarker for vitamin B12 because conversion of methylmalonyl-coenzyme A (CoA) to succinyl-CoA requires vitamin B12.

In the United States, vitamin C deficiency is seen primarily among malnourished populations, including patients with alcohol use disorder and the elderly.

Within the RER, specific #proline and lysine# residues are post-translationally #hydroxylated# to hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine by prolyl hydroxylase and lysyl hydroxylase, respectively.  #Vitamin C# is a #required cofactor# for this post-translational modification.  Defective hydroxylation of these residues severely diminishes the amount of collagen secreted by fibroblasts and impairs triple helix stability and covalent crosslink formation. $#(Choices A and B)#  After formation of the triple helix, procollagen molecules are secreted from the cell via the Golgi apparatus.  Propeptides at the N- and C-terminals are cleaved by extracellular procollagen peptidase to form insoluble tropocollagen molecules.  These monomers then self-assemble into collagen fibrils that are subsequently crosslinked via lysyl oxidase. $#(Choices C and D)#  Lysosomes and mitochondria are not directly involved in the synthesis of collagen. $#Educational objective# The hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues in collagen helps it attain its maximum tensile strength.  This process occurs in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and requires vitamin C as a cofactor.

Dietary carbohydrates are broken down into pyruvate via glycolysis; in patients with pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, the lack of enzymatic activity leads to a #buildup of pyruvate#, which is shunted to lactate via @lactate dehydrogenase@, generating a potentially life-threatening #lactic acidosis#. $Disease management involves the implementation of a #ketogenic diet#: a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet with moderate levels of protein.  This diet forces the production of ketone bodies from fat and amino acid catabolism to fuel the body in the place of glucose.  The near-absence of glucose in the diet decreases the amount of pyruvate generated, thereby decreasing lactate levels. $Amino acid catabolism results in formation of intermediates that are referred to as glucogenic, ketogenic, or both.

Galactose is then phosphorylated to galactose-1-phosphate by the enzyme galactokinase (GALK).  Galactose-1-phosphate is converted to glucose-1-phosphate by epimerization with transfer of uridine diphosphate (UDP) from UDP-glucose to UDP-galactose.  This reaction is catalyzed by #galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (GALT)#.  UDP-galactose is then epimerized to UDP-glucose by UDP-galactose-4 epimerase.  Although GALT deficiency is the most common form, a defect in any of these three enzymes can cause galactosemia. $#Galactosemia# can present with #vomiting# and lethargy soon after initiation of #breastfeeding#.  In GALT deficiency, toxicity of accumulated galactose-1-phosphate is responsible for impaired liver function (transaminitis, hyperbilirubinemia, hypoglycemia) and renal dysfunction (hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, aminoaciduria).  Patients are also predisposed to Escherichia coli (gram-negative rod) #sepsis#. $Restricting lactose intake (eg, breast milk) and initiation of soy milk-based formula can result in regression of cataracts and improvement in renal and liver function.  Soy milk consists of sucrose, which is metabolized to glucose and fructose.

GALT and GALK deficiency can lead to galactitol accumulation in the lens, which can lead to #cataract# formation in patients with galactosemia.  However, aldose reductase deficiency does not cause galactosemia. $#(Choice C)#  GALK phosphorylates galactose and its deficiency typically causes less severe manifestations of galactosemia with cataract formation (due to galactitol) being the most common manifestation.  Because galactose-1-phosphate does not accumulate, liver and renal functions are preserved. $#(Choice E)#  Phosphoglucomutase isomerizes glucose-1-phosphate to glucose-6-phosphate, which then enters the glycolytic pathway.  Its deficiency is rare.  In GALT deficiency, accumulation of galactose-1-phosphate blocks phosphoglucomutase, thereby preventing energy production via glycolysis. $#Educational objective# Classic galactosemia results from deficiency of galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase.

Within the cell, the positive charge of the K+ ions is normally neutralized by the negative charge of intracellular anions (eg, phosphates and proteins) that are trapped in the cell.  As K+ ions leave the cell, negatively charged anions accumulate along the inner side of the cell membrane.  This continually increasing negative charge attracts the positively charged K+ ions back into the cell.

  "explanation_2": "$Dietary fructose is obtained mainly from fruits, vegetables, honey, table sugar (sucrose), and processed foods.  Fructose is rapidly absorbed in the proximal small bowel by the hexose transporter GLUT 5.  Initial metabolism of fructose involves three enzymes: fructokinase, aldolase B, and triokinase.  Fructose is phosphorylated on the first carbon by hepatic fructokinase, yielding fructose-1-phosphate.  Metabolism of fructose-1-phosphate by aldolase B generates dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde.  Glyceraldehyde is then phosphorylated to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), an intermediate of glycolysis, by triose kinase.  DHAP can also be converted to G3P by triose phosphate isomerase. $Aldolase B deficiency causes the potentially life-threatening disorder known as hereditary fructose intolerance.  Patients typically present when fructose-containing foods are introduced into the diet.  The primary manifestations are vomiting and hypoglycemia about 20-30 minutes after fructose ingestion.  Hypoglycemia results from intracellular accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate and depletion of inorganic phosphate, which inhibit glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis.  Failure to thrive, hepatomegaly, and jaundice can also occur.  Undiagnosed individuals may eventually develop liver and renal failure.  Elimination of dietary fructose is the mainstay of treatment and results in symptom improvement with a good long-term prognosis. $#(Choices A and D)#  Galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase deficiency (classic galactosemia) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by vomiting, feeding intolerance, neonatal jaundice, hepatomegaly, and death if untreated.

Fructose from the diet is absorbed and secreted freely in the urine due to impairment of the first step in fructose metabolism. $#(Choice E)#  Glycogenolysis is accomplished mainly by glycogen phosphorylase and debranching enzyme, but a small amount is also broken down by the lysosomal enzyme α-1,4-glucosidase.  Alpha-glucosidase (or acid maltase) deficiency causes Pompe disease.

BH4 is converted from its unreduced form (BH2) by dihydropteridine reductase; it is an #essential cofactor# for the following hydroxylase enzymes: $• #Phenylalanine hydroxylase:#  This enzyme converts phenylalanine to tyrosine, and impaired conversion leads to hyperphenylalaninemia; impaired BH4 synthesis causes the same findings as phenylketonuria.  The excess phenylalanine causes #irreversible neurologic injury# (microcephaly, developmental delay, seizures) when untreated.  Elevated phenylalanine is also a competitive inhibitor of tyrosinase, an enzyme essential in the production of melanin; reduced melanin production explains this patient's #hypopigmentation#. $• #Tyrosine hydroxylase:#  Impaired conversion of tyrosine to L-dopa results in #reduced catecholamine production# because L-dopa is the precursor for dopamine (substantia nigra), norepinephrine (locus caeruleus), and epinephrine.  Impaired neurotransmitter production also leads to progressive neurologic findings, including extrapyramidal signs (eg, dystonia, truncal hypotonia) and autonomic dysfunction. $• #Tryptophan hydroxylase:#  Impaired conversion of tryptophan to #serotonin# results in dysregulation of mood, appetite, sleep, and muscle contraction. $#(Choice A)#  Branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase is a complex of enzymes that catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of the alpha-ketoacid derivatives of the branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, valine).  Deficiency causes maple syrup urine disease, which can affect neurotransmitter (eg, dopamine, serotonin) production and cause seizures.  Diffuse hypopigmentation would not be seen. $#(Choice B)#  Dopamine hydroxylase synthesizes norepinephrine from dopamine, and deficiency causes a rare form of dysautonomia (eg, orthostatic hypotension, hypothermia), not microcephaly or hypopigmentation. $#(Choice C)#  Homogentisic acid oxidase catalyzes a step in the degradation of tyrosine to fumarate (involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle).  Deficiency causes alkaptonuria, an autosomal recessive disease that causes homogentisic acid accumulation; findings include connective tissue hyperpigmentation, arthropathy (in adults), and urine that darkens after several hours. $#Educational objective# Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is an essential cofactor for hydroxylase enzymes involved in the metabolism of phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan.  Impaired BH4 synthesis causes hyperphenylalaninemia and reduced levels of neurotransmitters (eg, dopamine, serotonin), causing progressive neurologic findings (developmental delay, seizures, microcephaly).

  "explanation_2": "$Glucose is the major source of energy for all cells of the body.  In the majority of tissues, glucose transport occurs along its concentration gradient, from higher concentrations outside the cell toward lower concentrations inside the cell.  However, glucose cannot passively diffuse across the cell membrane in any significant amount and requires carrier proteins to aid its crossing.  Transport across the cell membrane by carrier proteins (which undergo conformational changes as the substrate is transported, unlike channel proteins) is termed carrier-mediated transport.  Transport that is facilitated by transmembrane proteins without the expenditure of energy is called #facilitated diffusion#. $Transmembrane carrier proteins that belong to the GLUT family transport glucose by facilitated diffusion.  These proteins are stereoselective and preferentially catalyze the entrance of D-glucose rather than L-glucose into cells.  #GLUT4# is the insulin-sensitive transporter found in skeletal muscle cells and adipocytes.  In these cells, the GLUT4 protein is stored in cytoplasmic vesicles.  Under the influence of insulin, the transporter protein is incorporated into the cell membrane.  An increased number of transporters in the membrane leads to an increased rate of glucose uptake by the cells.  Another important glucose transporter is #GLUT2#.  It facilitates export of glucose from the liver, small intestine, and kidneys into the circulation and also helps to control insulin secretion in the pancreas. $#(Choice A)#  Simple diffusion refers to the movement of particles along their concentration gradient directly through the cell membrane.  Transport of gases (O2 and CO2) occurs via simple diffusion, as the membrane is very permeable to small, nonpolar molecules. $#(Choice B)#  Endocytosis allows for cellular uptake through the formation of membrane-bound, typically clathrin-coated, vesicles.  Uptake of cholesterol by cells occurs by means of receptor-mediated endocytosis (mediated by the LDL receptor). $#(Choices D and E)#  Active transport refers to the movement of a substance against its concentration gradient.  This process requires energy as well as transport proteins.  In primary active transport, the energy required for transport against the concentration gradient is provided by the hydrolysis of ATP.  In secondary active transport, this energy is generated by co-transport of a separate substance down its concentration gradient.  Transport of glucose against the concentration gradient occurs via the Na/glucose symporter, which is found in the intestinal and renal tubular epithelium and is used to transfer glucose intracellularly from the lumen. $#Educational objective# Transport of glucose into the cells of most tissues occurs by means of facilitated diffusion.  Glucose moves from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration with the help of transmembrane glucose transporter proteins (GLUT).  These carrier proteins are stereoselective and have preference for D-glucose.  "

  "explanation_2": "$This patient with #latent tuberculosis# has laboratory values and bone marrow aspirate findings consistent with #sideroblastic anemia# due to isoniazid use. $Sideroblastic anemia is caused by #impaired heme production# within red blood cells.  When iron is transported to developing erythrocytes that cannot form heme, #iron granules# accumulate in mitochondria @circumferentially around the nucleus@, forming #ring sideroblasts# that can be seen on Prussian blue–stained bone marrow aspirate.  Etiologies include X-linked sideroblastic anemia (due to an δ-aminolevulinic acid synthase mutation), myelodysplastic syndrome, alcohol use disorder, copper deficiency, and certain medications (eg, isoniazid, chloramphenicol, linezolid). $#Isoniazid# directly inhibits the enzyme pyridoxine phosphokinase, which normally converts #pyridoxine# (vitamin B6) to its active form, pyridoxal 5' phosphate.  Pyridoxine is a cofactor for #δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) synthase#, the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in heme synthesis.  Inhibition of this enzyme impairs heme production and erythroid development to produce a #microcytic anemia#.  Pyridoxine deficiency can also lead to seborrheic dermatitis, glossitis, and peripheral neuropathy.  Therefore, pyridoxine is typically prescribed with isoniazid. $#(Choice A)#  δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase is another enzyme involved in heme synthesis.

Although cystathionine synthase is a pyridoxine-dependent enzyme, impairment does not result in sideroblastic anemia. $#(Choice D)#  Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency results in increased red blood cell susceptibility to oxidative stress (eg, infection, medication, fava beans), which triggers hemolysis.  This results in a normocytic, normochromic, hemolytic anemia without ring sideroblasts. $#(Choice E)#  Pyruvate kinase deficiency, an autosomal recessive disorder, results in a normocytic, normochromic, hemolytic anemia without ring sideroblasts. $#Educational objective# Isoniazid inhibits pyridoxine phosphokinase, leading to impaired activation of pyridoxine (vitamin B6).

  "explanation_2": "$@Hemoglobin electrophoresis@ is used to assess for different forms of hemoglobin in patients with suspected hemoglobinopathy.  Normal hemoglobin consists primarily of #hemoglobin A# (HbA), which #migrates rapidly# toward the positive electrode (anode) because of its negative charge.  Hemoglobin S (HbS) is an abnormal type of hemoglobin in which a nonpolar amino acid (valine) replaces a negatively charged amino acid (glutamate) in the beta globin chain.  This amino acid replacement decreases the negative charge on the HbS molecule, which causes #HbS# to move more #slowly# toward the anode.  Similarly, hemoglobin C (HbC) has a glutamate residue replaced by lysine in the beta globin chain.  Because lysine is a positively charged amino acid, #HbC# has even less total negative charge than HbS and moves #even more slowly# toward the anode.  Both HbC and HbS result from #missense mutations#, a type of mutation in which a single base substitution results in a codon that codes for a different amino acid. $Patients with sickle cell disease have HbS mutations in both beta chains; those with HbC disease have HbC mutations involving both beta chains.  Patients with hemoglobin SC disease have 1 HbS allele and 1 HbC allele and will have 2 hemoglobin bands on electrophoresis.  This patient's electrophoresis results show a #single band# that #migrates less than the HbA and HbS# bands, meaning that he has #HbC disease#.  Patients with HbC disease are typically asymptomatic and often have mild hemolytic anemia and splenomegaly. $#(Choice A)#  Deletions involving the alpha globin genes cause alpha thalassemia, which results in imbalanced beta chain production and formation of beta tetramers (hemoglobin H) that migrate further than HbA during electrophoresis. $#(Choice C)#  Nonsense mutations introduce a stop codon within gene sequences, resulting in the formation of truncated proteins.  As a result of their decreased size, these proteins tend to move further during electrophoresis. $#(Choice D)#  Silent mutations are point mutations that have no effect on the protein formed.  A mutation from UCA to UCC does not result in any change in protein structure as both codons result in the placement of serine into the growing polypeptide chain. $#(Choice E)#  Trinucleotide expansions increase the number of trinucleotide repeats within a gene, resulting in large, unstable proteins or alterations in the epigenetic effects.  These proteins would tend to move less during electrophoresis due to their increased size.  However, the hemoglobinopathies are not caused by trinucleotide expansions, as the hemoglobin genes do not contain trinucleotide repeat regions. $#Educational objective# Hemoglobin C is caused by a missense mutation that results in a glutamate residue being substituted by lysine in the beta globin chain.  This results in an overall decrease in negative charge for the hemoglobin molecule.  The speed of hemoglobin movement during gel electrophoresis is hemoglobin A > hemoglobin S > hemoglobin C.  ",

Deficiency of vWF impairs platelet adhesion and can lead to easy bruising and #prolonged mucocutaneous bleeding# (eg, gingival bleeding, heavy menses). $Laboratory workup in vWF deficiency reveals a normal platelet count and an #abnormal ristocetin cofactor assay#.  The ristocetin cofactor assay measures in-vitro, vWF-dependent platelet agglutination (indicative of impaired platelet adhesion in-vivo).  Ristocetin activates GP Ib receptors on platelets and makes them available for vWF binding; when the vWF level is decreased, there is #poor platelet agglutination in the presence of ristocetin#.

Platelet agglutination in response to ristocetin is normal because the levels of vWF and GP Ib receptors are normal. $#(Choice C)#  Congenital deficiency of factor XII (Hageman) causes marked PTT prolongation; however, it does not cause clinical bleeding complications.  Instead, patients may have a tendency for thromboembolic complications for unclear reasons. $#(Choice D)#  Thromboxane A2 deficiency is associated with aspirin treatment due to irreversible inactivation of cyclooxygenase in platelets.  The major effect is on GP IIb/IIIa-mediated platelet aggregation rather than GP Ib-mediated platelet adhesion; therefore, platelet agglutination to ristocetin is normal. $#Educational objective# Following endothelial damage, von Willebrand factor (vWF) binds glycoprotein Ib receptors on platelets to mediate platelet adherence.

  "explanation_2": "$In adults, hemoglobin A is the predominant form of hemoglobin.  It is a tetramer consisting of two alpha and two beta chains.  Normally the synthesis of alpha and beta chains is tightly regulated such that one α-chain is synthesized for every β-chain.  Hemoglobin formation begins within a few weeks of conception.  The initial hemoglobin formed by a fetus in utero is called embryonic hemoglobin (Gower).  This hemoglobin is composed of two zeta (ζ) and two epsilon (ε) chains (ζ2ε2) and is produced in the embryonic yolk sac.  Within a few weeks the fetal liver starts synthesizing hemoglobin F (fetal hemoglobin).  This form of hemoglobin is composed of two alpha and two gamma chains (α2γ2).  HbF is the major hemoglobin in the fetus during last few months of gestation and in infants during first few weeks of postnatal life.  HbA synthesis starts during the final month of gestation and gradually replaces HbF during postnatal life.  Knowing the chronology of fetal hemoglobin formation and the gradual transition to adult hemoglobin (HbA) is important in understanding the relationship between clinical manifestations and postnatal age in beta thalassemia. $Thalassemias are hereditary hemolytic anemias resulting from defective synthesis of globin chains.  As described above, the synthesis of alpha and beta globin chains is very coordinated.  In patients with thalassemia, the synthesis of either alpha or beta chains is defective.  Beta thalassemia is caused by defective synthesis of beta chains.  There are two copies of the beta globin gene (one from each parent).  If only one gene is defective the patient will have beta thalassemia trait (beta thalassemia minor) and lack significant anemia.  A defect in both beta globin genes results in severe hemolytic anemia known as beta thalassemia major.  In this disease, alpha chains are produced normally but they cannot form stable tetramers due to the lack of beta globin chains.  This failure to form stable hemoglobin leads to precipitation of alpha globin chains and premature lysis of red blood cells.  Beta thalassemia cannot become symptomatic as long as there are significant amounts of gamma chains present because gamma chains make up for the absence of HbA beta chains in forming tetramers.  Thus, in late gestation and early postnatal life, the expression of hemoglobin A is offset by gamma chain production #(choice C).#  As gamma chain production wanes, patients will become symptomatic. $#(Choice A)# α-globin is a normal component of both HbA and HbF.  α-globin synthesis is defective in α-thalassemia but it is normal in β-thalassemia.  α-globin is able to combine with γ-globin to form HbF.  This allows patients with β-thalassemia major to be asymptomatic in utero and in the first few months following birth. $#(Choice B)# β-globin synthesis is defective in patients with b-thalassemia. $#(Choice D)# δ-globin is a minor globin gene that is expressed at very low levels in normal adults.  Two α-globins and two δ-globins combine to form hemoglobin A2. $#(Choice E)# ζ-globin is a component of hemoglobin Gower, the initial hemoglobin formed by the embryo very early in embryogenesis. $#Educational objective# HbF contains γ-globin instead of β-globin.  Patients with homozygotic β-thalassemia (β-thalassemia major) are asymptomatic at birth due to the presence of γ-globins and HbF.  Switching to HbA production and the cessation of  γ-globin synthesis precipitates the symptoms of β-thalassemia.  "

Oxygen saturation increases in a sigmoidal fashion as the pO2 increases because of the increase in oxygen-binding affinity that occurs after the first oxygen molecule binds to hemoglobin.  As more oxygen molecules bind to hemoglobin, the number of available binding sites decreases and the curve eventually flattens out. $The partial pressure of oxygen in the blood at which hemoglobin is 50% saturated is known as the P50 (dotted black line in diagram above); this value is a standard measure of hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen and is about 26 mm Hg in normal individuals.

The partial pressure of oxygen at which hemoglobin is 50% saturated (#P₅₀#) is a value used as a conventional measure of hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen.  The P₅₀ is about 26 mm Hg in normal individuals.  A P₅₀ #shift from 26 to 20 mm Hg# indicates that the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen is increased (left shift of the oxygen dissociation curve). $Mutations that cause production of hemoglobin with #high oxygen affinity# (eg, hemoglobins Chesapeake and Kempsey) reduce the ability of hemoglobin to release oxygen within the peripheral tissues.  Low oxygen levels stimulate the kidneys to increase erythropoietin synthesis, which results in a #compensatory erythrocytosis# that helps maintain normal oxygen delivery.  Therefore, patients with high oxygen affinity hemoglobins are typically asymptomatic. $#(Choice B)#  Sickle cell disease can result in hypoxia-induced hemolysis due to the ability of deoxygenated hemoglobin S to polymerize and cause excessive erythrocyte sickling and irreversible cell membrane damage.  The oxygen dissociation curve for hemoglobin S is shifted to the right (↓ oxygen affinity) due to the stabilizing effects of polymerization on the deoxygenated form. $#(Choice C)#  Hereditary spherocytosis results from a variety of molecular defects involving erythrocyte structural proteins responsible for linking the plasma membrane to the cytoskeleton (eg, spectrin, ankyrin).

Hemoglobins with high oxygen affinity have a decreased P₅₀ that is represented by a leftward shift of the oxygen dissociation curve.

  "explanation_2": "Hemoglobin is a @tetramer@ that consists of 2 pairs of globin chains (total of 4 chains per molecule).  During the first few weeks of embryogenesis, hemoglobin is synthesized by the yolk sac and contains zeta or epsilon globin chains #(choices G and F)#.  Thereafter, one pair of the globin chains should always be alpha and the other should be non-alpha. $#Fetal hemoglobin (Hb F)# production begins around 8 weeks gestation and replaces all embryonic hemoglobin by 14 weeks gestation, when erythropoiesis in the fetal liver and spleen is established.  Hb F consists of 2 alpha and 2 gamma protein subunits (#α2γ2#).  Production declines at birth, and Hb F comprises ~60-80% of all hemoglobin in a term newborn.  Hb F is gradually replaced by adult hemoglobin (Hb A, α2β2) #(Choice A)# during the first 6 months of life, after which Hb A composes the vast majority of adult hemoglobin. $Compared to red blood cells with Hb A, those with Hb F have a #high oxygen affinity# as Hb F @binds to 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate@ poorly.  The greater affinity of Hb F facilitates transplacental oxygen delivery from the maternal circulation to that of the fetus. $#(Choice C)#  Hemoglobin A2 (α2δ2) is a normal hemoglobin variant that makes up 2%-3% of hemoglobin in a healthy adult and is functionally similar to Hb A.  Patients with beta-thalassemia major have impaired beta globin production, resulting in an excess of alpha globin chains (eg, Hb A2, Hb F) and no Hb A. $#(Choices D and E)#  Alpha-thalassemia results from a shortage of alpha globin chains.  Hemoglobin H (β4) and hemoglobin Barts (γ4) have a very high oxygen affinity and cannot release oxygen, resulting in tissue hypoxia.  Hemoglobin H disease manifests as chronic hemolytic anemia.  Hemoglobin Barts is incompatible with life (eg, hydrops fetalis) as normal fetal and adult hemoglobin cannot be produced. $#Educational objective# Hemoglobin F (Hb F) is the predominant hemoglobin type in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and during the first few months after birth.  Hb F consists of 2 alpha and 2 gamma protein subunits (α2γ2) and has a high affinity for oxygen, which facilitates oxygen transport across the placenta to the fetus.  Hb A (α2β2) is the major hemoglobin in adults.  ",

  "explanation_2": "Globin chains in the hemoglobin tetramer are compactly folded due to nonpolar hydrophobic residues in the interior and charged polar residues on the surface.  In #sickle cell disease#, the usual acidic (negatively charged) glutamic acid (glu) residue at the sixth position on the beta globin chain is replaced by a #nonpolar# (neutral charge) #valine# (val) residue, forming hemoglobin S (#HbS#).  This single glu → val substitution leads to the formation of a #hydrophobic pocket# on the beta globin surface that interacts with a complementary nonpolar residue on another hemoglobin molecule.  The hydrophobic interaction causes #polymerization# of HbS molecules and subsequent #erythrocyte sickling#, leading to membrane damage and permanent distortion of red blood cells.  Red cell sickling is promoted by low oxygen levels, increased acidity, and dehydration. $In patients with hemoglobin C (#HbC#), glu is replaced by a basic #polar# (positively charged) #lysine# (lys) residue.  Because lys is charged (although it has opposite polarity to glu), there is no hydrophobic interaction between hemoglobin molecules and no polymerization/sickling.  However, the positive charge of lys causes HbC to have decreased mobility on electrophoresis. $#(Choice B)#  HbS and HbC do not differ significantly from normal hemoglobin in affinity to 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG).  In addition, weaker interaction with 2,3-BPG would lead to increased oxygen affinity (left shift of the @oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve@), which would help ameliorate sickling. $#(Choice C)#  The ability of HbS to polymerize helps stabilize the deoxygenated form, causing a right shift of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve that facilitates oxygen unloading.  In contrast, impaired oxygen unloading occurs with carboxyhemoglobin due to an allosteric change that increases the affinity of the remaining 3 oxygen-binding sites. $#(Choice D)#  A glu → val substitution affects the 3-dimensional (tertiary) structure of hemoglobin, but it does not result in a significant change in the alpha helical (secondary) structure.  Introducing proline into the primary structure could distort the alpha helix due to proline's rigid cyclic structure. $#(Choice E)#  HbS and HbC mutations do not involve amino acids lining the heme pocket.  Heme iron oxidation (ferrous [Fe²⁺] → ferric [Fe³⁺]) results in methemoglobin formation.  Hemoglobin M disease is a congenital cause of methemoglobinemia due to a mutation in the heme-binding pocket. $#Educational objective# Hemoglobin S (HbS) contains valine in place of glutamic acid at the sixth amino acid position of the beta globin chain.

  "explanation_2": "$In #sickle cell (hemoglobin S [HbS]) anemia#, the nonpolar amino acid valine replaces the charged amino acid glutamate at position 6 of the β globin chain.  This results in the alteration of a hydrophobic portion of the β globin chain that fits into a complementary site on the α globin chain of another hemoglobin molecule.  As a result, hemoglobin molecules aggregate under anoxic conditions.  After polymerization, HbS initially forms a gel and then a meshwork of fibrous polymers causing the red blood cells to distort into an abnormal sickle shape. $#Sickling# is promoted by conditions associated with #low oxygen# levels, increased acidity, or low blood volume (dehydration).  Sickled cells are not flexible enough to pass through microvasculature.  As a result, they impede blood flow and cause microinfarcts in tissues and painful vasoocclusive crises.  Organs in which blood moves slowly (eg, spleen, liver) are predisposed to lower oxygen levels or acidity.  Organs with particularly high metabolic demands (eg, brain, muscles, placenta) promote sickling by extracting more oxygen from the blood (#oxygen unloading#).  The sickling process is complex and incompletely understood. $#(Choices A and C)#  The molecule 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) binds the 2 β globin chains ionically and stabilizes the taut (T) deoxyhemoglobin.  This binding decreases hemoglobin's oxygen affinity, facilitating oxygen release at the tissue level.  With 2,3-BPG depletion, hemoglobin affinity for oxygen increases (left shift on @oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve@), and this results in oxygen uptake by hemoglobin; therefore, erythrocyte sickling will decrease.  Similarly, increased acidity or low pH is associated with sickling, so decreased acidity with elevated capillary pH values >7.4 would not promote sickling. $#(Choice B)#  The globin chains in the hemoglobin tetramer are folded compactly, with nonpolar hydrophobic residues in the interior and charged polar residues on the surface.  A valine for glutamic acid substitution does not result in a significant change in β globin folding.  It is the mature hemoglobin tetramer that undergoes polymerization, not individual globin chains during folding. $#(Choice D)#  HbS does not polymerize when fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is present, so patients with sickle cell anemia often do not have symptoms until the HbF fraction decreases a few months after delivery.  Some patients with HbS may have fewer clinical manifestations because they produce larger amounts of HbF as adults. $#Educational objective# Hemoglobin S (HbS) aggregates in the deoxygenated state.  HbS polymers form fibrous strands that reduce red blood cell membrane flexibility and promote sickling.  Sickling occurs under conditions associated with anoxia including low pH and high levels of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient most likely has #familial erythrocytosis# due to a β-globin mutation resulting in reduced binding of #2,3-bisphosphoglycerate# (2,3-BPG).  2,3-BPG is synthesized from glycolytic intermediates and binds strongly to deoxyhemoglobin in a pocket formed between the 2 beta chains.  This binding reduces the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin, allowing more oxygen to diffuse into the peripheral tissues.  The hemoglobin 2,3-BPG binding pocket contains positively charged amino acids (eg, histidine and lysine) that attract the negatively charged phosphate groups in 2,3-BPG.  Mutations that decrease the positive charge of the binding site decrease 2,3-BPG binding and #increase hemoglobin oxygen affinity#. $#Fetal hemoglobin# (hemoglobin F) is synthesized primarily during fetal development (~8 weeks until term) and consists of the usual 2 alpha chains with 2 gamma chains in place of beta chains.  The gamma chains do not bind effectively to 2,3-BPG due to replacement of a histidine residue with serine.  As a result, fetal hemoglobin has significantly higher oxygen affinity than adult hemoglobin A.  This allows fetal hemoglobin to extract more oxygen from the mother's adult hemoglobin in the placenta, providing the developing fetus with an adequate supply of oxygen. $#(Choice A)#  Hemoglobin A1c is formed by non-enzymatic glycosylation of hemoglobin A.  Glycosylation can interfere with the binding of 2,3-BPG to hemoglobin by altering the physical structure of the binding pocket, which is compensated for by increased red cell 2,3-BPG levels in patients with diabetes.  However, the reduced 2,3-BPG binding affinity of this patient’s mutated hemoglobin more closely resembles that of hemoglobin F. $#(Choice B)#  Hemoglobin C results from a mutation in the β-globin chain that causes glutamate to be replaced by lysine.  Hemoglobin C forms hexagonal crystals and promotes red cell dehydration, causing a mild chronic hemolytic anemia.  2,3-BPG binding and tissue oxygen delivery are not significantly altered. $#(Choice D)#  A defect in the synthesis of alpha chains results in varying degrees of alpha thalassemia, which is characterized by the formation of β-globin and γ-globin tetramers (hemoglobin H and Barts, respectively).  These abnormal tetramers have extremely high oxygen affinity (resembling myoglobin) and are ineffective at delivering oxygen to tissues. $#(Choice E)#  Hemoglobin S is the predominant form of hemoglobin in sickle cell disease and is caused by replacement of a glutamate by valine in the β-globin chain.  This results in formation of hemoglobin polymers with reduced oxygen affinity. $#Educational objective# 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) normally forms ionic bonds with the beta subunits of deoxygenated hemoglobin A, facilitating oxygen release in the peripheral tissues.  Mutations that result in loss of the 2,3-BPG binding pocket's positive charge cause hemoglobin A to resemble fetal hemoglobin, which binds oxygen with a higher affinity due to its inability to interact with 2,3-BPG.

Hemoglobin A (the major form of hemoglobin in adults) is a tetramer consisting of 2 alpha and 2 beta chains.  Each hemoglobin subunit is associated with a heme moiety, so each hemoglobin molecule has 4 heme groups.  After binding to 1 oxygen molecule, the oxygen affinity of other heme molecules increases; this heme-heme interaction is responsible for the characteristic sigmoid shape of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve. $In contrast to hemoglobin, myoglobin is a monomeric protein and the primary oxygen-storing protein in skeletal and cardiac muscle tissue; it is only found in the bloodstream after muscle injury.  The partial pressure of oxygen at which 50% of myoglobin molecules are oxygen saturated (P50) is only 1 mm Hg, which is much lower than the P50 of hemoglobin (26 mm Hg).

  "explanation_2": "Cells produce energy via 2 main pathways depending on oxygen availability, as follows: $• #Anaerobic glycolysis# occurs in oxygen-poor states.  This pathway converts glucose → pyruvate → lactate in the cytosol, which is then excreted from the cell.  It nets #2 ATP#. $• #Oxidative phosphorylation# occurs in oxygen-rich states.  This pathway moves pyruvate from the cytosol to the mitochondria, where it is converted to acetyl-CoA and run through the #tricarboxylic acid cycle#.  This generates NADH, a reductive compound used to produce ATP in the electron transport chain.  Oxidative phosphorylation nets up to #36 ATP# for each glucose molecule. $Oxidative phosphorylation is the primary driver of energy metabolism in most terminally differentiated cells during normal conditions.  However, rapidly dividing cells such as stem cells and #cancer cells# generate most of their energy through anaerobic glycolysis despite the presence of adequate oxygen (Warburg effect) #(choice D).#  These cells produce significantly more #lactate# than a normal terminally differentiated cell as almost all glucose is converted to lactate and excreted. $The alteration of cellular metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation to anaerobic glycolysis is a crucial part of oncogenesis, and is thought to benefit cancer cells due to the following: $• Shunting glucose away from oxidative phosphorylation increases the concentration of glucose metabolic products (eg, ribulose 5-P, serine, glycine, glycerol) for the synthesis of nucleic acids, amino acids, and lipids. $• Lactic acid excretion promotes production of vascular endothelial growth factor by stromal cells, which improves blood flow to the tumor.  It also creates an acidic tumor microenvironment, which impairs antitumor cytotoxic T cells. $Because anaerobic glycolysis generates only 2 molecules of ATP per molecule of glucose, tumor cells uptake much more glucose than normal cells.  Therefore, areas of tumor activity can usually be visualized by positron emission scanning with radiolabeled glucose. $#(Choice A)#  Glutamine is converted to alpha-ketoglutarate, a component of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle; it is used as an alternative to glucose to generate NADH.  Tumor cells often increase (not decrease) glutamine absorption/conversion to increase NADH generation. $#(Choice B)#  One-carbon donor molecules (eg, serine, glycine, methionine) are used to generate nucleotides, phospholipids, and reduction factors as part of the folate and methionine pathways.  The production/use of one-carbon donor molecules is generally increased (not decreased) in rapidly dividing cells to provide adequate substrates for cellular proliferation. $#(Choice C)#  Tumors require large amounts of fatty acids as part of cell growth and replication; therefore, enzymes that generate fatty acids (eg, acetyl-CoA carboxylase) are typically upregulated (not downregulated). $#Educational objective# Rapidly dividing cells such as stem cells and cancer cells generate energy through anaerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect).  This pathway converts the majority of glucose to lactate despite the presence of adequate oxygen to run oxidative phosphorylation.  Therefore, cancer cells generally produce far more lactate than a normal terminally differentiated cell.  "

The incidence of cataracts increases with #age#; other risk factors include smoking, excessive sunlight exposure, #diabetes mellitus#, and glucocorticoid use.  In this patient, long-term hyperglycemia most likely contributed to cataract formation by causing #oversaturation of the polyol pathway#. $The first step in the polyol pathway (an alternative route of glucose metabolism) is the conversion of glucose into sorbitol by aldose reductase.  Sorbitol cannot readily cross cell membranes and is therefore trapped inside the cells where it forms.  The second enzyme in the pathway, sorbitol dehydrogenase, is able to #convert sorbitol into fructose# at a sufficient rate to prevent accumulation when glucose levels are normal.  However, the process is slow; in long-standing hyperglycemia, sorbitol accumulates in tissues with lower sorbitol dehydrogenase activity, such as the retina, lens, kidney, and peripheral nerves. $#Sorbitol accumulation# increases cellular #osmotic and oxidative stress# and contributes to the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy.  In lens cells, the increased stress leads to the development of hydropic lens fibers that degenerate, eventually resulting in lens opacification and cataract formation. $#(Choices B and C)#  Another function of aldose reductase is the conversion of galactose into galactitol (ie, this enzyme converts sugars into their corresponding sugar alcohols).  Galactitol production via this pathway is normally insignificant.  In galactosemia (galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase deficiency), an increased amount of galactitol is produced, resulting in congenital cataracts. $#(Choice D)#  The end product of sorbitol metabolism in most cells is fructose (not glucose), which is then excreted by the cells and taken up by the liver to produce glucose and triglycerides. $#(Choice E)#  Xylulose is an intermediate in the pentose phosphate pathway, which is used to generate NADPH (for cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis) and ribose 5-phosphate (for nucleotide synthesis). $#Educational objective# In the polyol pathway, aldose reductase converts glucose into sorbitol, which is slowly metabolized into fructose by sorbitol dehydrogenase.  Chronic hyperglycemia overwhelms this pathway, causing intracellular sorbitol accumulation and increased osmotic/oxidative stress.

HSL is activated in response to stress hormones (eg, catecholamines, glucagon, ACTH), whereas it is inhibited by the release of insulin.

Patients are at high risk for #thromboembolic occlusion# of both large and small vessels, especially those of the brain, heart, and kidneys.  Thromboembolic complications are the major cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients. $Homocystinuria is most frequently caused by an #autosomal recessive# deficiency of cystathionine beta-synthase, an enzyme that requires #pyridoxine (vitamin B6)# as a cofactor.  Approximately 50% of affected patients respond to high doses of pyridoxine, which improves residual enzymatic activity and reduces plasma homocysteine levels.  Additional treatment includes dietary #restriction of methionine#. $#(Choice A)#  Vitamin C is a necessary cofactor for the hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues in collagen.  Vitamin C deficiency results in decreased strength of collagen fibers and causes @scurvy@. $#(Choice B)#  Carnitine assists with long-chain fatty acid transport into mitochondria.  Deficiencies in carnitine (eg, primary systemic carnitine deficiency) lead to fatty acid oxidation defects in cardiac and skeletal muscle. $#(Choice D)#  Thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency can cause dry and wet beriberi and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. $#(Choice E)#  Tyrosine is a nonessential amino acid and the precursor for catecholamines such as dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. $#(Choice F)#  Vitamin K is involved in the post-translational conversion of glutamate to gamma-carboxyglutamic acid.  This modification is necessary for the function of many clotting factors and regulatory proteins involved in the coagulation cascade. $#Educational objective# Homocystinuria is most commonly caused by cystathionine synthase deficiency.  Affected individuals have marfanoid habitus, ectopia lentis, and developmental delay.  Significant morbidity and mortality are due primarily to thromboembolism.  Many patients with homocystinuria respond dramatically to pyridoxine (vitamin B6) supplementation.  ",

Certain cells (eg, retinal, endothelial, lens, renal mesangial, Schwann) are more vulnerable to hyperglycemia-induced damage because they are unable to regulate glucose transport when circulating levels are high. $Multiple metabolic pathways are involved in the pathogenesis of hyperglycemia-induced tissue damage: $• #Advanced glycosylation end-products (AGEs):#  Glucose can nonenzymatically attach to proteins and lipids, forming reversible glycosylation products that slowly stabilize into irreversible products.  Under hyperglycemic conditions, AGEs accumulate and facilitate deposition of LDL in blood vessel walls and inflammatory cell invasion that causes atherosclerosis and microangiopathic complications.  High glucose levels in the aqueous humor may also induce nonenzymatic glycation of lens proteins, which contributes to cataract formation. $• #Polyol pathway overactivity:#  The enzyme aldose reductase converts #glucose to sorbitol#, which is then oxidized to fructose by the enzyme sorbitol dehydrogenase.  With hyperglycemia, formation of sorbitol occurs faster than its metabolism to fructose, resulting in its accumulation.  Sorbitol increases the osmotic pressure in tissues and stimulates the influx of water, leading to #osmotic cellular injury#.  In addition, #oxidative stress# resulting from the depletion of NADPH (aldose reductase consumes NADPH) also contributes to cataract formation and other diabetic complications such as retinopathy, peripheral neuropathy, and nephropathy. $#(Choices A and B)#  Aldose reductase also catalyzes the conversion of galactose (obtained from dietary lactose) to galactitol, but sorbitol dehydrogenase is incapable of oxidizing galactitol to its corresponding keto sugar (tagatose, a food sweetener).

G6PD deficiency results in hemolytic anemia during times of increased oxidative stress. $#(Choice E)#  Lactate dehydrogenase catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to lactate under anaerobic conditions.  Excess lactate forms in hypoxic states, causing metabolic acidosis. $#Educational objective# In hyperglycemic states, aldose reductase converts glucose to sorbitol at a rate faster than sorbitol can be metabolized.  Sorbitol accumulates in certain cells such as lens cells, causing an influx of water and resulting in osmotic cellular injury.  Depletion of NADPH by aldose reductase also increases oxidative stress, which accelerates development of cataracts and diabetic microvascular complications (eg, neuropathy, retinopathy).  "

Glucose is metabolized by glucokinase to glucose-6-phosphate.  $3. Glucose-6-phosphate enters glycolysis to produce ATP.  $4. Increased ATP levels causes closure of ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels.  $5. Depolarization of beta cells triggers opening of voltage-dependent calcium channels.  $6.

Water-insoluble #cholesterol# is secreted in bile, where it is solubilized by detergent-like bile salts and phosphatidylcholine.  If there is more cholesterol than can be dissolved by the bile salts, it will @precipitate@ into insoluble crystals, leading to formation of gallstones.  Risk factors for gallstone formation include obesity or rapid weight loss, female sex, glucose intolerance, and hypomotility of the gallbladder (eg, pregnancy, prolonged fasting). $#Fibrate# medications (eg, fenofibrate, gemfibrozil) upregulate lipoprotein lipase, resulting in increased oxidation of fatty acids.  In addition, fibrates inhibit #cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase#, which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of bile acids.  The reduced bile acid production results in decreased cholesterol solubility in bile and favors the formation of cholesterol stones. $#(Choice A)#  Estrogens increase the biosynthesis of cholesterol by upregulating hepatic HMG-CoA reductase activity.  Estrogenic medications (eg, estrogen replacement therapy, combined oral contraceptives) increase the amount of cholesterol secreted in bile and contribute to formation of gallstones.  Aromatase catalyzes the conversion of androgens to estrogen; inhibition would lead to reduced gallstone formation. $#(Choice B)#  β-glucuronidase is released by damaged hepatocytes and bacteria in infected bile.  It deconjugates bilirubin, and the resulting free bilirubin precipitates with calcium in the bile to form pigmented gallstones.  Decreased activity of this enzyme would reduce the formation of pigmented stones but would not affect the formation of cholesterol gallstones. $#(Choices D and E)#  The first step in cholesterol synthesis is the condensation of 2 molecules of acetyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA acetyl transferase (thiolase) to form acetoacetyl-CoA.  Condensation with a third molecule of acetyl-CoA yields β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA).  HMG-CoA reductase then catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, the rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis.  Decreased activity of these enzymes would reduce cholesterol synthesis and the amount of cholesterol secreted in bile, discouraging cholesterol stone formation. $#Educational objective# Fibrate medications (eg, fenofibrate, gemfibrozil) inhibit cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of bile acids.

It is produced primarily in adipocytes, and large fat cells produce more leptin than small ones.  Serum leptin concentrations are highly correlated with body fat content. $Leptin decreases food intake in the following important ways:  $1. Leptin decreases the production of neuropeptide Y, a potent appetite stimulant, in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus.  $2. Leptin stimulates the production of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) in the arcuate nucleus.

  "explanation_2": "$Folate derivatives are crucial in the synthesis of nucleic acids (particularly thymine), conversion of homocysteine to methionine, and generation of one-carbon carriers (eg, S-adenosylmethionine) for methylation reactions.  All biochemical functions of folate require the reduced #tetrahydrofolate# form of the vitamin, which is synthesized by dihydrofolate reductase (a rate-limiting step in folate metabolism). $The enzyme #thymidylate synthase# is responsible for converting deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) to deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP).  Although most enzymes involved in one-carbon metabolism maintain folate in its active tetrahydrofolate form, thymidylate synthase is unique in that it oxidizes 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to dihydrofolate.  This makes #de novo thymidine synthesis# particularly susceptible to folate-deficient conditions because tetrahydrofolate must be continuously regenerated by dihydrofolate reductase. $In this experiment, inhibition of thymidylate synthase due to #deficient folate# increases the ratio of dUMP to dTMP, causing the incorporation of #uracil into DNA# in place of thymidine.  This leads to excessive activation of DNA repair mechanisms, resulting in double-stranded DNA breaks and apoptosis.  #Thymidine# supplementation reduces the metabolic folate demand, #preventing apoptosis# in folate-deficient cells. $#(Choice A)#  @Cobalamin@ is a necessary cofactor for methionine synthase, the enzyme that transfers a methyl group from 5-methyltetrahydrofolate to homocysteine, forming methionine and regenerating tetrahydrofolate.

The pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy is related to increased circulatory levels of #ammonia# and other neurotoxins due to failure of the liver to metabolize waste products. $Under normal conditions, astrocytes regulate neurotransmission by taking up glutamate present in the synapse, preventing excessive neuronal excitation.  Through the action of glutamine synthetase, glutamate undergoes a condensation reaction with ammonia to form glutamine (a non-neuroactive compound).  Glutamine is then released by the astrocytes and taken up by neurons, where it is converted back to glutamate for use as a neurotransmitter (@glutamate-glutamine cycle@). $When #excess ammonia# is present in the blood, it crosses the blood-brain barrier and is taken up by astrocytes, #increasing glutamine production#.  The presence of excess glutamine within astrocytes leads to increased intracellular osmolarity, causing astrocyte swelling and impaired glutamine release.

Red blood cell synthesis relies on vitamin B12–dependent recycling of folate; deficiency of either vitamin results in @megaloblastic anemia@.  Impaired myelin synthesis, specifically in the dorsal and lateral columns, results in #subacute combined degeneration# of the spinal cord.  This condition is progressive and begins as a symmetric neuropathy consisting of paresthesia and weakness.  Ongoing deficiency leads to loss of vibration and position sensation with development of an ataxic gait.  The longer the deficiency is untreated, the less likely the neurologic deficits can be reversed. $#(Choice A)#  Isoniazid is often used to treat latent tuberculosis infection.  It impairs the availability of vitamin B6, which can result in peripheral neuropathy in high risk patients (eg, pregnancy, HIV, diabetes mellitus); anemia (eg, conjunctival pallor) would be unexpected. $#(Choice D)#  Phenytoin, an antiepileptic drug used to treat focal and generalized seizures, may result in folate deficiency and development of megaloblastic anemia.  Phenytoin can also cause peripheral neuropathy, but this adverse effect usually occurs only with chronic therapy (>1 year). $#(Choice E)#  Vitamin D deficiency can develop over several months due to inadequate dietary intake and minimal sunlight exposure.  This deficiency presents as rickets in children and osteomalacia or osteoporosis in adults. $#Educational objective# Vitamin B12 is obtained through the diet solely from animal sources, which places strict vegans at risk for dietary deficiency.  This deficiency takes years to develop due to the large hepatic vitamin B12 reserve, and presents with megaloblastic anemia and potentially irreversible neurologic deficits (eg, paresthesia, weakness, ataxic gait).

As a result, fructose is metabolized by the liver faster than the other monosaccharides and is rapidly cleared from the bloodstream following dietary absorption. $Metabolism of fructose in the liver begins with phosphorylation by fructokinase to #fructose-1-phosphate (F1P)#.  Aldolase B can use both fructose-1,6-bisphosphate and F1P as substrates; it converts F1P into #dihydroxy acetone phosphate (DHAP)# and #glyceraldehyde#.  Glyceraldehyde can be either phosphorylated to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate by triokinase or converted to DHAP.

Cholesterol stones are yellow to pale gray and hard.  By contrast, #pigment gallstones# are composed of calcium salts of #unconjugated bilirubin#, are comparatively soft, and are dark brown to black. $#Brown# pigment stones typically arise secondary to bacterial (eg, Escherichia coli) or helminthic (eg, Ascaris lumbricoides, Clonorchis sinensis) #infection of the biliary tract#, which results in the release of #beta-glucuronidase# by injured hepatocytes and bacteria.

A small amount of conjugated bilirubin normally becomes deconjugated by endogenous beta-glucuronidase in the biliary tract.  When large amounts of conjugated bilirubin are excreted into the bile, enough becomes deconjugated to promote black pigment stone formation. $#(Choice A)#  Inhibition of 7-alpha-hydroxylase (eg, fibrates) reduces the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids and increases the risk of cholesterol stones.  However, this patient's gallstones are composed primarily of unconjugated bilirubin, not cholesterol. $#(Choices B and E)#  Aromatase catalyzes the conversion of androgens to estrogen, which increases hepatic cholesterol uptake.  In addition, estrogens upregulate HMG Co-A reductase, which increases cholesterol synthesis.  This increases biliary excretion of cholesterol, favoring formation of cholesterol stones, not pigment stones. $#(Choice D)#  Desmolase (cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme) catalyzes the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone, which is the first step in the synthesis of steroid hormones. $#Educational objective# Brown pigment gallstones are composed of calcium salts of unconjugated bilirubin and arise secondary to bacterial or helminthic infection of the biliary tract.

DNA replication occurs with a high degree of fidelity because mismatched nucleotides are repaired through the proofreading activity of DNA polymerases delta and epsilon.  However, this proofreading functionality is not infallible; base substitutions and small insertion-deletion mismatches occur due to errors in base pairing every 106 bases on average.  It is the function of the DNA mismatch repair system to fix these errors shortly after the daughter strands are synthesized.  The mismatch repair system involves several genes, including MSH2 and MLH1, which code for components of the human MutS and MutL homologs.  Mutations in these 2 genes account for around 90% of cases of Lynch syndrome.$",
  "explanation_2": "$Mismatch repair begins with MutS homolog detecting a mismatch on the newly created daughter strand, which is distinguished from the parent strand by occasional nicks in the phosphodiester bonds.  MutL homolog is then recruited, and the resulting complex slides along the DNA molecule until 1 of the daughter strand nicks is encountered.  At this point, exonuclease 1 is loaded onto and activated by the repair complex.  The daughter strand is then degraded backward past the initial mismatch point, leaving a variable gap of single-stranded DNA that is stabilized by ssDNA-binding protein.  The complex then dissociates while DNA polymerase delta loads at the 3' end of the discontinuity and begins synthesizing a new daughter strand segment.  Finally, DNA ligase I seals the remaining nick to complete the repair process. $#(Choice B)#  Exposure to ultraviolet light can cause pyrimidine (usually thymine) dimers to form due to covalent joining of adjacent pyrimidines.  Pyrimidine dimers interfere with DNA replication and are removed by nucleotide excision repair. $#(Choices C and D)#  Several types of insults can alter the DNA bases.  For example, nitrous acid can deaminate C, A, and G.  There are also spontaneous changes, such as deamination of C to U and the constant low-level loss of purines via thermal disruption.  Glycosylases are enzymes that detect and remove abnormal bases from DNA, creating an empty sugar-phosphate residue that is subsequently removed and replaced by the correct nucleotide (base excision repair). $#(Choice E)#  Exposure to ionizing radiation causes double-stranded DNA breaks that are repaired by end-joining repair mechanisms.  Non-homologous end joining, the main mechanism in primates, is more prone to cause mutations than homologous recombination. $#Educational objective# Lynch syndrome is an autosomal dominant disease caused by abnormal nucleotide mismatch repair.

In this energy-efficient recycling process, HGPRT normally converts free purine bases (hypoxanthine and guanine) into purine nucleotides (inosine monophosphate [IMP] and guanosine monophosphate [GMP], respectively).  The absence of HGPRT results in increased degradation of hypoxanthine and guanine bases into uric acid (causing hyperuricemia) and #increases demand for de novo purine synthesis#. $The first step of purine synthesis is the formation of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP).  Although PRPP can normally be utilized in the purine salvage pathway (in conjunction with HGPRT), patients with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome rely on PRPP function in de novo purine synthesis alone.  In this pathway, PRPP is converted to phosphoribosylamine by #PRPP amidotransferase#, the activity of which #must increase# in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome to supply adequate purine nucleotides for DNA synthesis and cellular metabolism. $#(Choices A, B, and F)#  Aspartate carbamoyltransferase, dihydroorotase, and thymidylate synthase are enzymes involved in pyrimidine, not purine, synthesis, and their activity does not change in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. $#(Choice C)#  HGPRT activity is absent or decreased, not increased, in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. $#(Choice E)#  Nucleotides are composed of purine or pyrimidine bases attached to a ribose sugar.  The enzyme ribonucleotide reductase converts the ribose sugar to its deoxyribose form for use in DNA synthesis; its activity is determined primarily by the cellular proliferation rate (eg, increased cell division requires more deoxyribose nucleotides) and is not affected in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. $#Educational objective# Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (eg, dystonia, self-mutilation, hyperuricemia) is caused by a mutation in the gene encoding hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT).  Reduced HGPRT activity leads to impaired purine salvage and increased de novo purine synthesis, a process necessitating increased phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase activity.  ",

Wernicke encephalopathy occurs due to chronic thiamine deficiency, which is common in patients with #alcohol use disorder#. $#Thiamine# (vitamin B1) participates in #glucose metabolism# and is a cofactor for the following enzymes: $• Pyruvate dehydrogenase, which converts pyruvate (glycolysis end product) into acetyl-CoA, which then enters the citric acid cycle $• Alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, an enzyme of the citric acid cycle $• Branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase, which is essential for the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids (eg, leucine, isoleucine, valine) $• #Transketolase#, an enzyme of the @pentose phosphate pathway@ that helps convert ribulose-5-phosphate (derived from glucose) to glycolysis intermediates (eg, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate) $Therefore, #thiamine deficiency# impairs glucose utilization, which can have catastrophic effects on the CNS as the brain always requires some glucose. $Thiamine deficiency is often diagnosed clinically in patients with a history of heavy alcohol use or malnutrition and signs of Wernicke encephalopathy; the diagnosis can be confirmed with a baseline #erythrocyte transketolase activity# that is #low# but increases after the addition of thiamine pyrophosphate.  Treatment involves thiamine supplementation with glucose; glucose administration alone may precipitate or worsen Wernicke encephalopathy due to rapid thiamine consumption. $#(Choice A)#  Erythrocyte glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the pentose phosphate pathway, which is necessary for production of NADPH and proper functioning of the erythrocyte antioxidant system.  Decreased G6PD levels cause intermittent hemolytic anemia due to oxidative stress. $#(Choices C and E)#  The metabolism of ethanol to acetyl-CoA consumes NAD+ and increases NADH/NAD+; therefore, NADH would likely be elevated in this patient.  In addition, without NAD+ and thiamine, pyruvate dehydrogenase is unable to convert pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and instead diverts pyruvate to the anaerobic glycolysis pathway, which ultimately increases (not decreases) lactate production. $#(Choice D)#  Methylmalonic acid, a product of fatty acid oxidation, is converted to succinyl-CoA by the enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (and uses vitamin B12 as a cofactor).  Consequently, methylmalonic acid levels are increased in vitamin B12 deficiency. $#Educational objective# Chronic thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency impairs glucose use, particularly in mammillary bodies, as seen in Wernicke encephalopathy.

Microfibrils are abundant in blood vessels (eg, aortic media), periosteum, and the suspensory ligaments of the lens.  Fibrillin in the extracellular space acts as a scaffold for deposition of elastin extruded from connective tissue cells.  Defects in fibrillin-1 cause mechanical weakening in the connective tissues and abnormal activation of transforming growth factor beta. $#Marfan syndrome# is caused by an inherited defect in the fibrillin-1 gene.  Patients with Marfan syndrome can often be identified due to a characteristic @body habitus@, with long thin extremities, loose joints, and long fingers (arachnodactyly).  The cause of death in Marfan syndrome is most often due to cardiovascular complications (eg, #aortic root dilation, dissection, and rupture#). $#(Choice A)#  Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a collection of heritable disorders of connective tissue characterized by skin and joint hypermobility.  Like those with Marfan syndrome, these patients are at risk for aortic rupture.  However, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome affects the formation and extracellular structuring of collagen rather than microfibrils. $#(Choice B)#  Homocystinuria is a rare inherited metabolic disorder due to cystathionine synthase deficiency.  It is characterized by very high circulating homocysteine levels, marfanoid habitus, and increased risk for premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. $#(Choice D)#  Osteogenesis imperfecta results from defects in the genes encoding type I collagen, a major component of bones.  Defects in type I collagen in osteogenesis imperfecta result in reduced bone mass and fragility fractures.  Other manifestations of the disease include blue sclera, dental abnormalities, and hearing loss. $#(Choice E)#  Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is a disorder of tubular epithelial cells.  It causes enlargement of the kidneys with numerous parenchymal cysts.  Patients are also at risk for cardiac valvular disorders and ruptured cerebral aneurysms. $#(Choice F)#  Deficiency of vitamin C (scurvy) causes impaired hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues in collagen.  Clinical features include skin fragility, easy bleeding, and poor dentition. $#Educational objective# Marfan syndrome is due to a defect in fibrillin-1, an extracellular glycoprotein that acts as a scaffold for elastin.

Patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency consequently develop excessive alveolar #elastin degradation#, which clinically manifests with #early-onset#, @lower lobe–predominant emphysema@. $Elastin is a fibrous connective tissue protein that provides elasticity to the skin, blood vessels, and pulmonary alveoli.  The fibers can stretch to several times their length and recoil back to their original size once stretching forces are withdrawn.  Elastin assembly is closely related to that of collagen.  Similar to collagen, elastin is synthesized as a large polypeptide precursor (tropoelastin) composed of about 700, mostly nonpolar, amino acids (eg, glycine, alanine, valine) #(choice D).#  Elastin also contains proline and lysine residues; however, in contrast to those found in collagen, few of these amino acids are hydroxylated #(choice C).# $After tropoelastin is formed, it is secreted into the extracellular space where it interacts with microfibrils (fibrillin) that function as a scaffold.

The incomplete blood-brain-barrier in children is vulnerable to the #neurotoxic# effects of lead, which include long-standing behavioral problems and developmental delay or regression. $#Anemia# in lead poisoning results from inhibition of #ferrochelatase# and #δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) dehydratase# in the heme biosynthesis pathway.

In general, uracil is found only in RNA, so the question essentially asks which enzyme involved in DNA synthesis catalyzes the formation of RNA strands.  In prokaryotic DNA replication, primase (an RNA polymerase) is responsible for synthesizing a short RNA primer using the separated strands of DNA at the replication fork as templates.  DNA replication then proceeds, with DNA polymerase using the 3' hydroxyl group of the RNA primer as a starting point for synthesis.  Primase is a crucial enzyme for bacterial replication as DNA polymerase cannot initiate DNA synthesis without this short nucleic acid sequence primer. $#(Choice A)#  DNA ligase is the enzyme that repairs single-strand breaks in duplex DNA during DNA replication and repair. $#(Choices B and C)#  During replication, DNA polymerase III is the primary enzyme responsible for synthesis of daughter DNA strands; DNA polymerase I functions chiefly to replace the RNA primers with DNA segments.  Unlike DNA polymerase III, DNA polymerase I has 5'→ 3' exonuclease activity that can remove RNA primers and damaged DNA segments.  The 3'→ 5' exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase I and III provides a proofreading function that fixes mismatched nucleotides in the newly formed daughter strands. $#(Choices D and E)#  Helicase unwinds DNA at the replication fork.

  "explanation_2": "$Calcium plays an important role in excitation-contraction coupling in cardiac, smooth, and skeletal muscle cells.  Myocyte depolarization causes activation of L-type calcium channels on the plasma membrane.  In @#cardiac@ and @smooth muscle cells@#, this leads to an #influx of extracellular calcium# that activates sarcoplasmic RyR channels, inducing the release of additional calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (calcium-induced calcium release).  The released calcium binds to troponin (cardiac muscle) or calmodulin (smooth muscle), allowing actin and myosin to interact and cause muscle contraction. $In contrast, the L-type calcium channels in #skeletal muscle# directly interact with RyR calcium channels to release calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.  This #mechanical coupling# between the receptors allows sarcoplasmic calcium release to occur without significant influx of calcium across the plasma membrane.  #Verapamil# is a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that acts by #blocking L-type calcium channels#, preventing the initial calcium influx into cardiac myocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells.  Because skeletal muscle is not dependent on extracellular calcium influx, calcium channel blockers do not affect skeletal muscle contractility. $#(Choice A)#  Troponin (but not calmodulin) is responsible for contraction of both cardiac and skeletal muscle.  Unlike skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle is affected by verapamil due to its dependence on extracellular calcium to induce calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. $#(Choice B)#  A rise in intracellular calcium concentration results in a structural change in the troponin complex that allows actin and myosin to interact and cause skeletal muscle contraction.  Calcium channel blockers do not affect troponin's affinity to intracellular calcium. $#(Choice C)#  An elaborate T tubule system is present in skeletal and cardiac muscle but not in smooth muscle.  T tubules are a communication of the extracellular space that allows the depolarization impulse to reach deep into the cell, nearer to the myofilaments.  They are in close proximity to the sarcoplasmic reticulum and therefore facilitate rapid release of intracellular calcium stores. $#(Choice D)#  Unlike cardiac myocytes and specialized smooth muscle tissue (eg, gastrointestinal tract, ureters), skeletal muscle does not display automaticity and contracts only in response to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.  However, the mechanical coupling between L-type and RyR calcium channels is responsible for skeletal muscle's resistance to verapamil. $#Educational objective# Contraction initiation in cardiac and smooth muscle cells is dependent on extracellular calcium influx through L-type calcium channels, which can be prevented by calcium channel blockers (eg, verapamil).  Skeletal muscle is resistant to calcium channel blockers, as calcium release by the sarcoplasmic reticulum is triggered by a mechanical interaction between L-type and RyR calcium channels.  ",

  "explanation_2": "This patient has easy bleeding/bruising, gingivitis, and follicular hyperkeratosis, findings indicative of #vitamin C deficiency (scurvy)#.  This condition is rare in resource-rich regions but can be seen in patients who are at risk for #malnutrition# (eg, alcohol use disorder, anorexia), as in this case. $Vitamin C is a required cofactor for the #hydroxylation of proline and lysine# by prolyl and lysyl hydroxylases, respectively, during @collagen synthesis@.  The hydroxylated residues (hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine) are essential for the formation of a stable triple helix collagen structure as well as the cross-linking of collagen molecules, both of which contribute to the tensile strength of collagen. $Impaired hydroxylation in vitamin C deficiency compromises collagen's tensile strength, increasing capillary wall fragility and causing petechiae/ecchymoses, #mucosal bleeding# (eg, nosebleeds), and perifollicular hemorrhages.  #Periodontal disease# (@gingival erythema@/edema/bleeding) and hyperkeratotic follicles (due to keratin plugging) with coiled/@corkscrew hairs@ are also common features.  In addition, defective collagen production is associated with #poor wound healing#, as seen in this patient with a chronic, noninfected ulcer. $#(Choice A)#  Thiamine (vitamin B1) is a cofactor in several decarboxylation reactions that are catalyzed by dehydrogenase enzymes (eg, pyruvate to acetyl coenzyme A) in the citric acid cycle.  Deficiency can cause peripheral neuropathy (dry beriberi), heart failure (wet beriberi), and central nervous system dysfunction (Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome). $#(Choice C)#  Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) is a cofactor in several reactions that involve amino acids (eg, transamination, decarboxylation, deamination).  In contrast to this case, pyridoxine deficiency manifests with cheilosis, glossitis, and peripheral neuropathy. $#(Choices D and E)#  Folate deficiency causes decreased purine and thymidine synthesis, which manifests with megaloblastic anemia (eg, fatigue, pallor, irritability).  Vitamin B12 is a cofactor for the synthesis of methionine from homocysteine and for synthesis of succinyl coenzyme A from methylmalonyl coenzyme A; deficiency also presents with megaloblastic anemia in addition to neurologic dysfunction. $#Educational objective# Vitamin C is a required cofactor for the hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues during collagen synthesis.  Vitamin C deficiency (scurvy), primarily seen in patients with malnutrition (eg, alcohol use disorder), leads to capillary bleeding (eg, epistaxis), poor wound healing, follicular hyperkeratosis, and periodontal disease.
