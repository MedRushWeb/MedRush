This value decreases to approximately 150 mm Hg in the trachea due to the partial pressure of water vapor.  @Normal@ #alveolar PO2 is 104 mm Hg#, which lies between the tracheal (150 mm Hg) and systemic venous blood (40 mm Hg) PO2 concentrations.  Likewise, normal #alveolar PCO2 is 40 mm Hg#, also between its respective tracheal (0 mm Hg) and systemic venous blood concentrations (45 mm Hg). $Transfer of O2 and CO2 between the blood and the alveoli depends on both perfusion and diffusion.  Under normal resting conditions, diffusion of O2 and CO2 is a quick process, with blood needing to traverse only one-third of the total pulmonary capillary length to completely equilibrate.  In this setting, gas exchange is perfusion-limited (ie, diffusion is fast enough that the total gas exchange depends only on the amount of blood supplied to the alveoli). $#Diffusion-limited gas exchange# takes place when diffusion across the alveolar membrane is relatively slow enough to become the major limitation to gas exchange.  This can occur with exercise (due to extremely high perfusion volumes that the diffusion rate cannot keep up with) or with pathologic conditions that disrupt the alveolar membrane (eg, pulmonary fibrosis, emphysema) and slow diffusion.  #CO2 diffuses 20 times faster than O2#, even when the alveolar membrane is somewhat disrupted; therefore, alveolar and capillary CO2 concentrations typically fully equilibrate while alveolar and capillary O2 concentrations do not. $In this experiment, there is a #large PO2 gradient# between the alveoli (104 mm Hg) and the pulmonary venous blood (70 mm Hg) but pulmonary venous #PCO2 is normal# (40 mm Hg), indicating incomplete gas exchange most likely due to diffusion impairment. $#(Choice A)#  @Bronchopulmonary shunting@ describes the normal small drop in PO2 and small increase in PCO2 that occurs due to the pulmonary veins receiving deoxygenated blood from the bronchial circulation.  However, this normally only results in about a 4 mm Hg drop in PO2 within the pulmonary veins. $#(Choice C)#  In normal alveolar ventilation and perfusion, the alveolar and pulmonary capillary PO2 rapidly reach equilibrium at 104 mm Hg. $#(Choice D)#  @Intrapulmonary shunting@ can occur when the alveoli fill with fluid (eg, pneumonia, pulmonary edema) or collapse (eg, atelectasis) and alveolar ventilation is essentially zero.  This patient's alveolar PO2 of 104 mm Hg is not consistent with shunting (alveolar PO2 equilibrates with venous blood at 40 mm Hg when ventilation is zero). $#(Choice E)#  @Poor alveolar ventilation@ (ie, hypoventilation) does not affect gas exchange between the alveoli and the blood; therefore, no O2 gradient is created. $#Educational objective# Gas exchange between the alveoli and pulmonary capillary blood depends on both perfusion and diffusion.  The exchange of O2 and CO2 in a normal individual at rest is perfusion-limited, so alveolar and capillary partial pressures are equal.  Situations in which O2 exchange becomes diffusion-limited (eg, emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis) cause a large gradient between alveolar and capillary PO2; PCO2 is less affected due to the greater diffusing capacity of CO2.

At very low partial pressure of O2 (pO2), hemoglobin is mostly deoxygenated, and binding of O2 molecules is relatively difficult (as indicated by the early flatness of the curve).  As the partial pressure of O2 increases, O2 binds to 1 of the 4 binding sites on hemoglobin and #increases the O2-binding affinity# of the other available binding sites (steepening of the curve), a phenomenon known as #cooperative binding#.  Subsequently, additional O2 molecules bind more easily as the pO2 increases until hemoglobin becomes nearly fully saturated. $The binding of O2 molecules to hemoglobin in the lungs has two consequences, known as the #Haldane effect#: $• The affinity of hemoglobin for CO2 is decreased, resulting in unloading of CO2 from hemoglobin (this accounts for a small percentage of overall CO2 in the blood and is not pictured above). $• The acidity of the hemoglobin molecule is increased; in response, #protons (H+ ions) are released# from the hemoglobin binding sites. $The H+ ions combine with bicarbonate ions (the primary form of CO2 in the blood) in the lungs to facilitate the production of water (H2O) and CO2.

Although anatomic @dead space@ (nasopharynx to terminal bronchioles) remains constant after early adulthood when the bronchial tree reaches full maturity, alveolar dead space increases with age due to progressive elastin degeneration, alveolar simplification, and capillary dropout. $The net result is a mechanically disadvantaged respiratory system (lower compliance) that must contend with increased dead space.

Therefore, inspired tidal volume has less opportunity to participate in gas exchange.  In other words, physiologic @dead space@ is #increased#. $• The muscles of respiration (chiefly the diaphragm) undergo remodeling over time, with atrophy of fast-twitch muscle fibers.
