    "explanation_2": "$This patient with risk factors for stroke (eg, hypertension, diabetes mellitus) has #crossed signs# of: $• #left oculomotor nerve# (CN III) #dysfunction# (eg, ptosis, impaired pupil constriction, down-and-out eye, diplopia). $• #right# (ie, contralateral) #arm and leg weakness# with upper motor neuron signs (eg, hyperreflexia, upgoing Babinski). $Because most cranial nerves (other than CN II & IV) do not decussate while most of the body's motor and sensory fibers cross the midline in the medulla, #brainstem strokes# are characterized by ipsilateral cranial nerve deficits accompanied by contralateral hemiparesis or hemisensory loss (ie, crossed signs). $CN III originates in the #midbrain# of the brainstem, further localizing the lesion.  Left CN III palsy with contralateral arm and leg weakness (corticospinal tract) is most likely caused by a left midbrain infarction due to occlusion of the mesencephalic branches of the posterior cerebral artery (ie, #Weber syndrome#).  This can develop from obstruction of perforating arteries of the basilar bifurcation. $#(Choice A)#  A stroke in the cerebral cortex can lead to weakness with upper motor neuron (UMN) signs.  However, it is often accompanied by cortical signs (ie, deficits localizing to the cortex) that may include #V#isual disturbances (eg, hemianopia, gaze preference), #A#phasia (ie, typically expressive Broca), #N#eglect, and cortical #S#ensory deficits (eg, inability to recognize movement drawn on the palm) (ie, #VANS# stroke scale).  Cranial nerve deficits would not be expected. $#(Choice B)#  A stroke in the internal capsule leads to contralateral hemiparesis.  Because it is such a small anatomic area, in addition to the arm and leg, there is also usually facial weakness sparing the upper face (UMN-type weakness).  Cranial nerve deficits are more consistent with a brainstem stroke. $#(Choice D)#  Pontine infarctions can cause ipsilateral cranial nerve deficits with contralateral hemiparesis.  However, the involved @cranial nerves@ originate in the pons:  Trigeminal (CN V) (facial paresthesia), abducent (CN VI) (abducens palsy), facial (CN VII) (facial palsy), and vestibulocochlear (CN VIII) (vertigo).  A pontine infarction would not likely cause CN III deficits. $#(Choice E)#  Medullary infarctions can cause ipsilateral cranial nerve deficits with contralateral hemiparesis.  However, the involved cranial nerves originate in the medulla:  Glossopharyngeal (CN IX) (diminished gag, palate weakness), vagus (CN X) (dysphonia), and hypoglossal (CN XII) (tongue weakness).  Medullary infarctions often result in well-known clinical stroke syndromes (eg, @lateral medullary syndrome@, @medial medullary syndrome@). $#Educational objective# Crossed signs (ie, cranial nerve dysfunction with contralateral limb weakness) raise suspicion for brainstem stroke.  Midbrain infarction due to occlusion of the posterior cerebral artery results in Weber syndrome characterized by ipsilateral oculomotor nerve (CN III) dysfunction accompanied by contralateral hemiparesis.

Above the splenic flexure, peristalsis is controlled by parasympathetic innervation from the vagus nerve. Beyond the splenic flexure, it is controlled by #parasympathetic innervation# from the #S2-S4# nerve roots.$The innervation of the anal sphincter is complex and under voluntary, parasympathetic, and sympathetic control; therefore, #fecal incontinence# can occur due to lesions at multiple levels of the nervous system (eg, frontal cortex, spinal cord, peripheral nerves). The anal sphincter consists of an:$• #External sphincter#, which includes #skeletal muscle# and is under voluntary control innervated by the pudendal nerve (#S2-S4# branches)$• Internal sphincter, which includes smooth muscle that is contiguous with the rectum. Sympathetic innervation normally maintains it in a state of tonic contraction.

This is leading to impaired peristalsis beyond the splenic flexure (ie, constipation) and flaccid weakness of the external anal sphincter (fecal incontinence).$#(Choices A and D)# Cervical or thoracic spinal cord injury could affect the upper motor neuron pathways involved in voluntary external anal sphincter function. However, this would lead to increased sphincter tone.$(Choice B) The pudendal nerve is involved in external anal sphincter innervation; dysfunction can lead to fecal incontinence.

However, distal colon stool retention is more likely related to impaired parasympathetic activity of the S2-S4 nerve roots. Also, vagal injury would not affect anal sphincter tone.$Educational objective Sacral spinal cord injury can lead to lower motor neuron injury of the S2-S4 nerve rootlets; these contribute parasympathetic innervation to the distal colon to stimulate peristalsis and voluntary motor innervation to the external anal sphincter. Lesions in this area can lead to distal colon stool retention, fecal incontinence, and a weak external anal sphincter."

Iatrogenic axillary nerve injury can occur during shoulder surgery (eg, proximal humerus fracture repair) or intramuscular injection in the deltoid. $#(Choice B)#  The latissimus dorsi is innervated by the thoracodorsal nerve which can be damaged during axillary lymph node dissection.  It is the most powerful adductor of the arm and assists with extension and medial rotation. $#(Choice C)#  The levator scapulae is innervated by the C3 and C4 cervical nerves and the dorsal scapular nerve (C5).

Lesions in this area would lead to superior quadrant visual field defects (ie, contralateral homonymous superior quadrantanopia).  The superior optic radiations, which carry information from the superior retina/inferior visual field, travel through the parietal lobe white matter; lesions here lead to contralateral lower quadrantanopia. $#(Choice E)#  After the axons of the retinal ganglion cells travel through the optic chiasm, they synapse in the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus.  Therefore, a lesion in the right LGN would lead to left-sided visual loss (eg, left homonymous hemianopia). $#(Choice F)#  Because the image projected on the retina is inverted and reversed, a lesion of the upper right retina would lead to a monocular lower left visual field defect. $#Educational objective# Visual loss in only one eye indicates that the lesion is anterior to the optic chiasm.  Images projected onto the retina are inverted and reversed.  ",

However, it would not lead to ptosis or a constricted pupil. $#(Choice D)#  A constricted pupil occurs in Horner syndrome because the normal parasympathetic activity is not balanced by the sympathetic activity.  This relative overactivity of parasympathetics when compared to the activity of sympathetics leads to pupillary constriction.

    "explanation_2": "$This patient has an acute lacunar @ischemic stroke@ affecting the left medial pons at the level of the middle cerebellar peduncle.  The #trigeminal nerve# (CN V) exits the brainstem at the lateral aspect of the #mid-pons# at the level of the #middle cerebellar peduncles# (a key neuroanatomic landmark for locating the nerve).  The trigeminal sensory nuclei (eg, principal sensory, spinal, mesencephalic) run from the midbrain to the upper cervical spine and receive afferent signals for facial sensation via all 3 nerve branches (ophthalmic, maxillary, and mandibular).  The motor nucleus is located in the lateral mid-pons and sends efferent signals to the muscles of mastication (eg, temporalis, masseter, pterygoids) via the mandibular branch. $#Infarcts# involving the #anterior pons# can affect the corticospinal tract (#contralateral hemiparesis#, Babinski sign) and corticobulbar tract (contralateral #lower facial palsy#, dysarthria).  Disruption of the corticopontine fibers that convey motor information from the cortex to the ipsilateral pontine gray matter may also result in contralateral dysmetria and dysdiadochokinesia (#ataxic hemiparesis#).  The cerebellar deficits are contralateral to the lesion as the pontocerebellar fibers arising from the pontine gray matter decussate and enter the cerebellum through the contralateral middle cerebellar peduncle. $#(Choice A)#  The facial nucleus is located in the dorsolateral aspect of the caudal pons, and the nerve exits at the ventrolateral pontomedullary junction (below the middle cerebellar peduncles).  This patient has #sparing# of the forehead muscles, which indicates that his facial weakness is a result of a central lesion affecting the corticobulbar tract and is not due to direct damage to the facial nucleus/nerve. $#(Choice B)#  The hypoglossal nucleus is located medially on the floor of the fourth ventricle at the level of the medulla, and the nerve exits at the rostral end of the preolivary sulcus. $#(Choice C)#  The oculomotor nucleus is located in the rostral midbrain at the level of the superior colliculus and red nucleus, and the nerve exits at the interpeduncular fossa. $#(Choice E)#  The trochlear nucleus is located in the caudal midbrain, and the nerve exits the @dorsal midbrain@ just below the inferior colliculus (below the red nucleus).  The trochlear nerve is the only cranial nerve to decussate before innervating its target (superior oblique muscle). $#Educational objective# Infarcts involving the anterior portion of the medial pons can produce dysarthria and contralateral hemiparesis/lower facial palsy due to disruption of the ipsilateral corticospinal and corticobulbar tracts.  The trigeminal nerve arises at the level of the middle cerebellar peduncle at the lateral aspect of the mid-pons. ",

The underlying etiology of TMD is multifactorial but includes temporomandibular joint (TMJ) derangement (eg, jaw misalignment, trauma) and #hypersensitivity of the mandibular nerve#. $The mandibular nerve (CN V3) is the largest branch of the #trigeminal nerve# and supplies sensation to the TMJ, floor of the mouth, anterior tongue, and the @lower part of the face@.  It also innervates the muscles of mastication (eg, medial and lateral pterygoid, masseter, temporalis), tensor veli palatini, and the @tensor tympani@ in the middle ear, which dampens loud sounds by tensing the tympanic membrane. $Mechanical derangement of the TMJ can result in irritation and hypersensitivity of the mandibular nerve, leading to pathologic contraction of the pterygoid muscles (worsening the jaw pain and dysfunction) and tensor tympani (causing #ear pain# and #muffled hearing# despite a normal otoscopic examination). $#(Choice A)#  Most patients with TMD have cervical spinal dysfunction and neck pain due to muscular and functional connections between the jaw and cervical regions.  However, cervical spinal nerve damage is usually caused by overt structural lesions of the cervical spine (eg, cervical spondylosis, disc herniation) and would not result in ear pain or muffled hearing (but rather neck, shoulder, and arm pain/weakness). $#(Choice B)#  The facial nerve (CN VII) provides sensory innervation to the external auditory canal/concha and motor innervation to the muscles of facial expression and the stapedius muscle, which dampens high-amplitude sound wave transmission.  However, the facial nerve does not innervate the pterygoid muscles or TMJ. $#(Choice D)#  The maxillary nerve (CN V2) provides sensory innervation to the cheek, nares, upper lip, and teeth.  Involvement of the maxillary nerve in trigeminal neuralgia can cause facial pain; however, muffled hearing and pterygoid muscle dysfunction indicate mandibular nerve involvement. $#(Choice E)#  The vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII) carries auditory and balance information from the inner ear.  Damage to the cochlear portion of CNVIII (eg, vestibular schwannoma) can result in hearing loss; however, it would not be associated with facial pain or pterygoid muscle dysfunction. $#Educational objective# Temporomandibular disorder is associated with dysfunction of the temporomandibular joint and hypersensitivity of the mandibular nerve (CN V3).

Saccular aneurysms typically arise from branch points on the circle of Willis, and most (85%) affect the anterior circulation (eg, anterior communicating, posterior communicating, and middle cerebral arteries).  Chronic smoking and poorly controlled hypertension are risk factors.  Unruptured aneurysms are usually asymptomatic, but patients may experience headache and cranial neuropathies due to mass effect. $CN III is a pure motor nerve that exits the midbrain between the posterior cerebral and superior cerebellar arteries and courses along the posterior communicating artery, making it particularly susceptible to injury from posterior communicating artery aneurysms.  It carries general visceral efferent fibers on its surface (for the pupillary light and near-reflex pathways) and general somatic efferent fibers within its interior (innervating superior rectus, inferior rectus, medial rectus, inferior oblique, and levator palpebrae superioris muscles).  Consequently, @aneurysmal compression of CN III@ produces #mydriasis# (due to superficial parasympathetic fiber damage) with diplopia, #ptosis#, and #down and out deviation# of the ipsilateral eye (due to somatic efferent fiber injury). $#(Choice A)#  The junction of the anterior communicating artery and anterior cerebral artery is the most common location for saccular aneurysms; however, aneurysms in this region typically compress the central optic chiasm, causing bitemporal hemianopia. $#(Choices B and C)#  Saccular aneurysms of the middle cerebral artery typically occur at its distal bifurcation and do not usually affect the oculomotor nerve. $#(Choice E)#  Posterior communicating artery aneurysms cause symptoms on the same side as the lesion due to damage to the ipsilateral oculomotor nerve.

Although these aneurysms could potentially cause oculomotor palsy by compressing the oculomotor nerve as it exits the midbrain, this presentation is rare and usually associated only with very large aneurysms that cause multiple neurologic deficits. $#Educational objective# The oculomotor nerve (CN III) is most susceptible to injury from ipsilateral posterior communicating artery aneurysms.

    "explanation_2": "$This patient's stroke has resulted in vertigo and bulbar weakness (eg, difficulty swallowing), in addition to loss of pain and temperature sensation on the left side of the face and right side of the body.  Because #most cranial nerves# (other than CN II & IV) #do not decussate# while most of the body's motor and sensory fibers cross the midline in the medulla, brainstem strokes characteristically lead to ipsilateral cranial nerve deficits and contralateral deficits of the body (ie, #crossed signs#).  Therefore, this patient's stroke likely impacted the #left brainstem#.  Specifically, this patient has the following: $• #Vertigo# without hearing loss, suggesting a lesion impacting the #vestibular nucleus# rather than the peripheral CN VIII (which would likely result in hearing loss as well). $• Loss of pain and temperature #sensation# on the left (ipsilateral) side of the #face# with neuropathic pain in that area, suggesting involvement of the #spinal trigeminal nucleus# $• Loss of pain and temperature sensation on the right (contralateral) side of the #body#, which suggests dysfunction of the #spinothalamic tract# $These areas are all located in the left lateral medulla.  This constellation of symptoms is consistent with #lateral medullary (Wallenberg) syndrome#.  @Horner syndrome@ is also common due to damage of the descending @sympathetic nervous system@ fibers that travel very close to the spinothalamic tract. $#(Choices B and E)#  Ischemia impacting the medial medulla can damage the pyramidal tract (contralateral hemiparesis), medial lemniscus (contralateral loss of tactile, vibratory & position sense), and hypoglossal nucleus, which causes tongue deviation toward the lesion due to ipsilateral hypoglossal nerve (CN XII) palsy.  The strong side \"pushes\" the tongue toward the weak side when it is protruded. $#(Choices C and F)#  Strokes in the midbrain can damage the red nucleus (ataxia), cerebral peduncle (contralateral hemiparesis), and, often, oculomotor nerve fascicles (ipsilateral CN III palsy). $#(Choice D)#  A lesion in the right lateral medulla would cause decreased pain and temperature in the right side of the face (ipsilateral) and left side of the body (contralateral). $#Educational objective# A lateral medullary infarct (Wallenberg syndrome) leads to vertigo (vestibular nucleus), loss of pain/temperature sensation on the ipsilateral face (trigeminal nucleus) and contralateral body (spinothalamic tract), bulbar weakness (lower cranial nerves), and ipsilateral Horner syndrome (descending sympathetic nervous system fibers).

The perception of flavor is dependent on both smell and taste, with smell being more important.  Patients with #anosmia (loss of smell)# often describe difficulties with taste, even if taste sensation is intact. $The perception of smell is mediated by odorant molecules that bind to olfactory chemoreceptor cells in the nasal mucosa.  Axons of the chemoreceptor cells make up the olfactory nerve (CN I) rootlets, which project through the #cribriform plate# of the ethmoid bone to synapse on the glomeruli of the olfactory bulb.  The olfactory bulb then projects second-order axons to the primary olfactory cortex in the medial temporal lobe via the olfactory tract. $Head trauma can cause anosmia when acceleration-deceleration forces lead to #avulsion# of the #olfactory nerve rootlets# as they transverse the cribriform plate. $#(Choice A)#  The anterior temporal lobe is important for semantic memory; as a result, injury to this brain region typically results in impaired comprehension about the meaning of words, pictures, and objects. $#(Choice C)#  Dorsolateral medulla infarction causes @Wallenberg syndrome@.

Fibers of the chorda tympani nerve, a branch of the facial nerve (CN VII), also travel with the lingual nerve to relay taste from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue.  If taste disturbances were due to injury of the lingual nerve, tongue numbness would also be present. $#(Choice E)#  Sphenoid bone fractures are associated with damage to the optic nerve (CN II), pituitary gland injury, and leakage of cerebrospinal fluid into the sphenoid sinus. $#Educational objective# Olfactory signals are relayed via the olfactory nerve (CN I) through the cribriform plate to the olfactory bulb, which then projects to the primary olfactory cortex in the medial temporal lobe.

Patients with #MCA occlusion# usually present with #contralateral hemiparesis# and #hemisensory loss# involving the #face and upper limb# due to infarction of the corresponding @motor and sensory cortices@.  The contralateral lower limb is typically less affected.  Other features may include spatial neglect of the contralateral side (damage to the nondominant parietal lobe) and contralateral homonymous quadrantanopia (damage to the optic radiations in the subcortical temporoparietal lobe). $If the stroke affects the dominant (usually left) hemisphere, the @speech areas@ of the brain can be damaged.  Consequently, patients with left MCA stroke (right-sided motor and sensory deficits) also often have expressive or receptive aphasia due to infarction of the Broca and Wernicke areas, respectively #(choice H).# $#(Choices A and G)#  Occlusion of the anterior cerebral artery causes contralateral motor and sensory deficits, with the lower limb being affected more than the upper limb.  Bilateral anterior cerebral artery occlusion can cause significant behavioral symptoms (eg, abulia), primitive reflexes (eg, Moro, grasp), and urinary incontinence due to damage of the prefrontal cortex. $#(Choices C and F)#  @Saccular aneurysms@ often affect the anterior and posterior communicating arteries in the circle of Willis.  Anterior communicating artery aneurysms can compress the central optic chiasm, causing bitemporal hemianopia.  Posterior communicating artery aneurysm frequently compresses the oculomotor nerve, producing ipsilateral mydriasis, ptosis, and \"down and out\" eye deviation. $#(Choices D and I)#  Posterior cerebral artery territory infarction typically results in contralateral hemianopia due to infarction of the visual cortex.  The macula is often spared due to collateral circulation from the MCA. $#(Choice E)#  Basilar artery occlusion usually damages the base of the pons, which contains the corticospinal and corticobulbar tracts, and the paramedian tegmentum.  Consequently, patients typically have quadriplegia, bulbar dysfunction (eg, facial weakness, dysarthria), and oculomotor deficits (eg, horizontal gaze palsy). $#(Choice J)#  Occlusion of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery causes lateral pontine syndrome.  Patients with this condition typically have ipsilateral loss of pain or temperature in the face (trigeminal nucleus), ipsilateral facial weakness (facial nucleus), ipsilateral hearing impairment (cochlear nucleus), contralateral loss of pain and temperature in the trunk and extremities (lateral spinothalamic tract), and cerebellar dysfunction (eg, ataxia, dysmetria). $#Educational objective# Occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) typically results in contralateral hemiparesis and hemisensory loss of the face and upper limb with relative preservation of lower limb function.  If the occluded MCA is in the dominant (usually left) hemisphere, aphasia may also occur.  ",

This presentation is consistent with the classic triad of #Wernicke encephalopathy# (WE), a complication of thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. #Thiamine# is a cofactor for multiple enzymes involved in glucose metabolism; deficiency results in the brain's inability to use glucose and turn it into energy, leading to neuronal damage and necrosis.

In patients unresponsive to behavioral therapy and unable to take medications, a bladder stimulator is sometimes used. Neural stimulation is used to augment neural signals to the pelvic floor muscles and urinary sphincter, which are innervated from nerves derived from the #S2-S4 nerve roots#: $• #Somatic innervation# of the #pelvic floor muscles# helps to maintain continence because these muscles stabilize the urethra against the anterior vaginal wall. This contraction decreases the angle between the bladder neck and the urethra (ie, urethrovesical angle), thereby compressing the urethra, stopping urine flow, and maintaining continence. Therefore, increasing the strength of the pelvic floor muscles (either through physical therapy or neuromodulatory stimulation) promotes continence. $• The #external urethral sphincter# (EUS) is also under somatic control via the #pudendal nerve# (S2-S4); therefore, stimulation of these nerve roots will increase EUS tone to help improve urinary continence. $Although the #pelvic splanchnic nerves#, derived from S2-S4, are classically described as providing #parasympathetic# input to the bladder and urethral sphincter (which promotes bladder contraction and may worsen incontinence), they are also involved in the #bladder stretch-contraction reflex#. Neural stimulation seems to inhibit this reflex to improve continence. $(Choice A) The nucleus accumbens is part of the basal ganglia that mediates reward and pleasure. Transcranial magnetic stimulation targeting this area has been used to treat addiction, but it plays no role in urinary continence. $(Choice B) Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus has been used to treat the rigidity of Parkinson disease, but it is not involved in urinary continence. $(Choice C) The vagus nerve (CN X) is involved in regulating the gastrointestinal system (eg, parasympathetic innervation stimulates gastric muscle contraction and intestinal motility); stimulation is occasionally used to improve gastric motility. However, the vagus nerve does not play a role in micturition or urinary continence. $(Choice D) The T6 nerve root contributes to the greater splanchnic nerve (T5-T10), which provides sympathetic innervation to the foregut to slow peristalsis. However, sympathetic stimulation of the bladder, which inhibits detrusor contraction, originates lower, from about T10-L2. $(Choice E) The L5 nerve root contributes somatic innervation to many muscles of the lower limb (eg, gluteal muscles, tibialis muscles, extensor hallucis longus) but does not innervate the pelvic floor, bladder, or urethral sphincters. $Educational objective Urge incontinence can be treated with neuromodulation directed toward the S2-S4 nerve roots, which improves pelvic floor muscle strength and contraction of the external urethral sphincter; it may also impact the bladder stretch-contraction reflex.",

      "explanation_2": "$The @femoral nerve@ (L2-L4) innervates the quadriceps muscles (enabling extension at the knee and flexion at the hip) and provides sensation for the arch of the foot, shin, and anteromedial thigh.  The nerve emerges between the psoas and iliacus muscles and passes under the #inguinal ligament# (lateral to the femoral artery) into the thigh before branching in the femoral triangle into an anterior and posterior division. $The optimal site for a #femoral nerve block# is right below the inguinal ligament (ie, in the inguinal crease) at the lateral border of the femoral artery.  Injecting at this site #anesthetizes #the skin and muscles of the #anterior thigh, femur, and knee# and can be used during repair of the quadriceps tendon.  The block also anesthetizes structures supplied by the saphenous nerve (ie, the terminal extension of the femoral nerve) to decrease sensation in the medial leg below the knee. $#(Choices A and D)#  The saphenous nerve (a branch of the femoral nerve that supplies sensation to the leg) can be anesthetized directly at the level of the adductor canal in the thigh (ie, adductor canal block) or at the medial tibial condyle in the knee (ie, saphenous nerve block).  However, the branches of the femoral nerve that supply the knee arise proximal to the saphenous nerve and would not be anesthetized by injection at these locations. $#(Choice C)#  The ischial spine divides the greater and lesser sciatic foramina in the bony pelvis.  The ischial spine tip is a landmark for @pudendal nerve block@, which is used for anesthesia during vaginal deliveries and for minor surgeries of the vagina and perineum. $#(Choice E)#  The obturator canal is a small gap in the obturator membrane (ie, the fibrous sheet covering the obturator foramen) that allows the obturator artery, obturator vein, and obturator nerve to travel from the pelvis to the thigh.  An obturator nerve block would anesthetize the adductor muscles of the thigh and the skin of the medial aspect of the thigh but would not affect the quadriceps muscles or sensation to the knee. $#Educational objective# A femoral nerve block below the inguinal ligament (ie, in the inguinal crease) will anesthetize the skin and muscles of the anterior thigh, femur, and knee.  This type of block can be used in patients requiring tendon repair after a knee injury (eg, quadriceps rupture). ",

Spontaneous vestibular schwannomas are usually unilateral, whereas bilateral vestibular schwannomas are associated with neurofibromatosis type 2. $The facial nerve (CN VII) and trigeminal nerve (CN V) are in proximity to CN VIII at the cerebellopontine angle and may be compressed by vestibular schwannomas.  Symptoms can vary based on the pattern of nerve involvement: $• Impairment of the cochlear portion of CN VIII leads to ipsilateral #sensorineural hearing loss# and #tinnitus #(ringing in the ear), and damage to the vestibular portion causes unsteadiness and #disequilibrium#. $• Compression of CN V may cause loss of ipsilateral facial sensation with interruption of the afferent limb of the corneal reflex. $• CN VII compression can result in ipsilateral facial muscle paralysis (eg, asymmetric smile). $#(Choice A)#  Craniopharyngiomas arise from remnants of Rathke's pouch and are typically located in the suprasellar region.

Optic nerve fibers from the temporal part of the retina travel laterally (ie, without crossing) through the optic chiasm to pass into the ipsilateral optic tract.

Lesions localized to this area can lead to contralateral lower quadrantanopia. $#(Choice H)#  Lesions to the primary visual cortex in the occipital lobe also lead to a contralateral homonymous hemianopia.  If this occurs due to occlusion of the posterior cerebral artery, the macula is typically spared due to collateral circulation from the middle cerebral artery to the occipital pole. $#Educational objective# An aneurysm of the internal carotid artery can laterally impinge on the optic chiasm.

The common fibular nerve originates in the popliteal fossa as the lateral branch of the sciatic nerve.  After coursing around the posterolateral head and lateral neck of the fibula, it divides into superficial and deep branches: $• The superficial branch innervates the muscles of the lateral compartment of the leg (foot #eversion#) and provides #sensation# to the #dorsum of the foot# and lateral shin. $• The deep branch innervates the muscles of the anterior compartment of the leg (foot and toe #dorsiflexion#) and provides sensation to the #web space# between the first and second toes. $Common fibular nerve injury from extrinsic #compression# (eg, pressure from cast, surgical positioning) most commonly occurs at the #fibular head# because of its bony prominence and the superficial position of the nerve.

Lateral compartment syndrome can injure the superficial branch of the fibular nerve, causing impaired foot eversion and sensory loss over the lateral shin and dorsal foot, but weakness in foot dorsiflexion would not be expected. $#(Choices D and E)#  After coursing through the popliteal fossa, the tibial nerve innervates the posterior compartment muscles of the leg.  It then passes through the tarsal tunnel below the medial malleolus and provides sensory innervation over the sole and motor innervation to the intrinsic foot muscles.  Injury at the tarsal tunnel can cause sensory loss over the sole (vs the dorsum) with intrinsic foot muscle weakness.  Injury at the popliteal fossa can cause additional weakness on foot plantar flexion (vs dorsiflexion), foot inversion (vs eversion), and toe flexion. $#Educational objective# Common fibular (peroneal) nerve injury can occur with extrinsic compression at the fibular head, resulting in weakness on foot dorsiflexion and eversion.

If the patient is unable to maintain this stance easily, some form of ataxia (cerebellar or sensory) is likely present.$To differentiate sensory from cerebellar ataxia, the patient is asked to close the eyes while maintaining the aforementioned posture. Removing the visual input forces the patient to rely on input from proprioceptive receptors in the trunk and extremities for posture maintenance.

It is innervated by the cervical branch of the facial nerve (CN VII). $#(Choice E)#  The sternocleidomastoid, a superficial neck muscle controlling neck flexion and head rotation, is innervated by the accessory nerve (CN XI). $#Educational objective# An interscalene nerve block is used to provide anesthesia for the shoulder and upper arm by anesthetizing the upper brachial plexus (C5-C7) as it passes between the anterior and middle scalene muscles.  Anesthetic also transverses along the interscalene sheath, frequently resulting in transient ipsilateral diaphragmatic paralysis due to involvement of the phrenic nerve roots (C3-C5).  ",

Classic manifestations of a pineal gland mass include #obstructive hydrocephalus# from aqueductal stenosis (papilledema, headache, and vomiting) and #dorsal midbrain (Parinaud) syndrome# due to direct compression of the pretectal region of the midbrain. Parinaud syndrome is characterized by limitation of upward gaze with a downward gaze preference, bilateral eyelid retraction (eg, Collier sign, sclera visible above the superior corneal limbus), and light-near dissociation (eg, pupils that react to accommodation but not to light). Diagnosis of pineal gland mass is made by brain MRI. The most common pineal mass is a #germinoma, a midline# malignant tumor thought to arise from embryonic germ cells. A germinoma can also arise in the gonads or mediastinum and is more common in young boys. The most common locations for intracranial germinomas are the pineal gland and the suprasellar region (less common site) $(Choice A).

Acute dystonia can develop abruptly anytime between 4 hours and 4 days after receiving an antipsychotic medication.  The condition is characterized by a sudden, involuntary contraction of a major muscle group.  Other examples of acute dystonia include oculogyric crisis (forced, sustained elevation of the eyes in an upward position), opisthotonus (arching of the back with the head thrown backward), and, rarely, laryngospasm.  The risk is highest with high-potency, first-generation antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol, fluphenazine). $ Acute dystonic reactions are theorized to result from the antipsychotic property of #D2 antagonism# in the #nigrostriatal pathway#.  In the striatum, the inhibitory effects of dopaminergic neurons (D2) are normally balanced by the excitatory actions of muscarinic cholinergic neurons (M1).  Strong dopaminergic blockade causes an excess of cholinergic activity, resulting in extrapyramidal side effects (eg, acute dystonic reactions, akathisia, parkinsonism).  Medications with M1 receptor antagonist properties, such as benztropine or the antihistamine diphenhydramine, help re-establish the dopaminergic-cholinergic balance and effectively treat acute dystonia. $ (Choice A)  Blockade of alpha-1 adrenergic receptors causes orthostatic hypotension and dizziness. $ (Choice C)  Flumazenil, a benzodiazepine GABA-A receptor antagonist, can be used to treat benzodiazepine overdose.  However, it may precipitate withdrawal seizures in patients with chronic benzodiazepine use. $ (Choice D)  Antagonism of central histamine H1 receptors causes sedation and weight gain. $ (Choice E)  Antagonism of muscarinic receptors causes anticholinergic side effects (eg, confusion, dry mouth, urinary retention).  Low-potency antipsychotics (eg, chlorpromazine, thioridazine) are more likely to cause these effects due to their strong blockade of central and peripheral muscarinic cholinergic receptors. $ (Choice F)  Second-generation antipsychotics antagonize serotonergic 5-HT2A, but this does not typically cause dystonia. $ Educational objective Acute extrapyramidal symptoms (eg, dystonia, akathisia, parkinsonism) are due to D2 blockade in the nigrostriatal pathway.  First-generation, high-potency antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol, fluphenazine) strongly block D2 receptors and are most likely to cause extrapyramidal symptoms."

Comprehensive medication review (including over-the-counter agents and other family members' prescriptions) is essential to every delirium workup.  The definitive treatment for delirium must address the #underlying cause# (eg, treat the medical illness, remove the offending medication). $ Dementia (often previously unrecognized) is among the most common risk factors for delirium, and cognitive assessment should follow delirium resolution. $ (Choice A)  Brief psychotic disorder may be diagnosed in patients with ≥1 day but <1 month of psychotic symptoms not better explained by a medical illness/medication effect.  Patients with brief psychotic disorder are typically alert without altered consciousness. $ (Choice B)  Like delirium, dementia with Lewy bodies can cause visual hallucinations and cognitive fluctuations.  However, it is marked by early executive dysfunction (eg, driving difficulty, job impairment), follows a progressive course, and has other neurologic findings (eg, parkinsonism, REM sleep behavior disorder). $ (Choice C)  Frontotemporal dementias are a group of several neurodegenerative diseases.  They can present with behavioral disturbance (eg, impulsivity, disinhibition, apathy) or language impairment (eg, aphasia).  Unlike delirium, they have a gradual onset with a progressive course, and hallucinations are atypical. $ (Choice D)  Hypothyroidism presenting as delirium is rare, but would be possible if severe (ie, myxedema coma); however, progressive lethargy with hypothermia, hypotension, and bradycardia is typically present.  Delirium is a more common manifestation of acute thyrotoxicosis. $ Educational objective Delirium involves the acute onset of fluctuating disturbances in attention (eg, altered consciousness) and cognition (eg, disorientation, hallucinations).  When no clear medical illness is apparent, medication-induced delirium should be suspected.  Psychoactive drugs (eg, anticholinergics, antihistamines, benzodiazepines, sedative-hypnotics, opioids) are common causes, and over-the-counter agents and unauthorized prescriptions should not be overlooked."

These findings are consistent with an #old cerebral infarc#, which was likely responsible for this patient's chronic neurologic symptoms (eg, extremity weakness, seizures). $ Interruption in blood supply to an area of the brain (eg, thrombosis, embolism) induces irreversible ischemic changes in neurons.  Release of #lysosomal enzymes# from ischemic neurons and responding inflammatory cells (eg, neutrophils, macrophages) results in tissue degradation in the affected region (#liquefactive necrosis#).  Over time, phagocytic cells remove the necrotic tissue, leaving a cavity, while astrocytes proliferate around the periphery to form a scar (gliosis). $ Liquefactive necrosis is characteristic of irreversible CNS injury because of the brain's high cholesterol content and lack of supporting architecture.  It also occurs in other body tissues in the setting of severe infection/inflammation (eg, bacterial abscess) due to massive release of hydrolytic enzymes from reacting inflammatory cells. $ (Choice A)  Early fibroblast migration to an area of injury occurs outside of the CNS and results in the formation of granulation tissue and fibrous scarring.  In the CNS, tissue repair and scar formation are performed by astrocytes. $ (Choice B)  A granulomatous reaction against parasites within the CNS occurs in neurocysticercosis.  However, multiple cystic lesions or residual calcified granulomas would be expected. $ (Choice C)  @Multiple sclerosis@ is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease characterized grossly by multiple periventricular lesions (ie, demyelinating plaques).  Cystic cavity formation does not occur. $ (Choice D)  Although glioblastoma can present with areas of cystic necrosis on gross examination, these areas classically are part of a diffuse, poorly delineated, heterogenous mass with midline shift away from the affected tissue. $ Educational objective Liquefactive necrosis is characterized by complete digestion and removal of necrotic tissue with formation of a cystic cavity.

  "explanation_2": "This patient's #ectopic antidiuretic hormone# production is likely to cause #chronic hyponatremia# due to excessive resorption of free water by the kidneys.  Decreased serum tonicity causes water to cross the blood brain barrier and enter the central nervous system.  In response to cellular swelling, brain cells excrete osmolytes (organic solutes [glutamate, myoinositol], electrolytes), resulting in intracellular water loss and normalization of brain volume. $ #Overly rapid correction# of chronic hyponatremia can cause #osmotic demyelination syndrome# (also known as central pontine myelinolysis).  A rapid increase in extracellular tonicity (eg, due to aggressive saline hydration) quickly draws water out of central nervous system cells.  The resulting uncontrolled cell shrinkage leads to degeneration of astrocytes (crucial for myelin maintenance) and oligodendrocytes.  Demyelination typically affects the #pons#, but can also occur at extrapontine sites (eg, basal ganglia and #cerebral white matter#). $ Clinical features typically become apparent within 2-6 days.  Features may include #spastic quadriplegia# (corticospinal tract involvement) and #pseudobulbar palsy# (dysphagia, dysarthria, tongue paresis).  Patients with involvement of the bilateral pons may develop #locked in syndrome# with near-total paralysis and aphasia but with intact cognitive abilities, blinking, and vertical eye movements. $ (Choice A)  Parathyroid hormone–related protein production is associated with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung; the resultant hypercalcemia can cause cardiac arrhythmias.  However, rapid correction of hypercalcemia is not associated with arrhythmias. $ (Choice C)  Cerebral edema results from rapid correction of hypernatremia with hypotonic fluids (free water flows into brain cells).  This typically occurs in patients with chronic dehydration or diabetes insipidus (antidiuretic hormone deficiency or resistance), not with excessive antidiuretic hormone production. $ #(Choices D and E)#  Severe hypophosphatemia can occur when feeding a severely malnourished patient (refeeding syndrome).  It results in ATP depletion, which can cause hemolysis and rhabdomyolysis (diffuse myonecrosis).  Patients require rapid correction of the phosphorus deficiency to prevent these conditions (unlike sodium, which should be corrected slowly to prevent osmotic demyelination). $ Educational objective Rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia may lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome (also known as central pontine myelinolysis).

VaD is often caused by 2 (potentially overlapping) mechanisms: $ • @Large artery infarction@ (often causing an overt stroke) produces a #cortical-type VaD#, in which accompanying neurologic signs/symptoms reflect the specific cortical region involved (eg, middle cerebral artery infarction causing contralateral weakness and sensory impairment). $ • #Small artery# (ie, arteriole) infarcts can combine to cause enough cumulative damage to the brain, resulting in noticeable cognitive deficits.  Although the clinical picture is varied, a subcortical-type VaD is common because there is less arteriole collateralization in the subcortical regions compared to the cerebral cortex.  As in this patient, #subcortical-type VaD# is often accompanied by focal motor deficits (eg, reflex asymmetry, strength differences), abnormal gait, urinary symptoms, and psychiatric symptoms (eg, depressive syndromes). $ Subcortical VaD is due to either cerebral amyloid angiopathy or, more commonly, #small vessel arteriolosclerosis#.  Arteriolosclerosis is common in older patients, especially those with a history of hypertension. $ (Choice B)  Degeneration of the cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain is seen in Alzheimer disease, which presents with progressive memory loss and functional impairments.  However, Alzheimer disease typically progresses gradually with early, prominent short-term memory loss, and it would not cause focal neurologic findings (eg, strength deficits, reflex asymmetry). $ (Choice C)  Degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra is characteristic of Parkinson disease, which can cause executive and visuospatial dysfunction with relatively mild memory impairment.  However, Parkinsonian features (eg, rigidity, resting tremor, bradykinesia) occur at least a year before the onset of dementia. $ (Choice D)  Sudden acceleration-deceleration or rotational forces during blunt head injury can cause diffuse shearing of the long white matter tracts (diffuse axonal injury).  Patients have a history of acute trauma and neurologic impairment out of proportion to neuroimaging findings. $ (Choice E)  Neuronal loss and atrophy of hypothalamic mamillary bodies characteristically occurs in Wernicke encephalopathy, a complication of thiamine deficiency.  Although it can cause ataxia and confusion, it also typically presents with oculomotor dysfunction (nystagmus, ophthalmoplegia), and patients typically have a history of either chronic alcohol use or malnutrition. $ Educational objective Small artery cerebral arteriolosclerosis can lead to ischemia that predominantly affects the subcortical areas.

The locus ceruleus is a pontine structure that is one of the primary areas of norepinephrine synthesis in the brain.  The substantia nigra, located in the midbrain, contains dopaminergic neurons whose axons project to the striatum (nigrostriatal pathway) and participate in regulation of voluntary movements. $ (Choice D)  Damage to the mammillary bodies and medial thalamus is characteristic of chronic Wernicke encephalopathy and Korsakoff syndrome.  Both disorders result from chronic thiamine deficiency, most often in the context of heavy alcohol use. $ (Choice E)  Medial temporal and parietal cortical atrophy is characteristic of Alzheimer disease.  The medial temporal lobe contains the hippocampus, a structure involved in the formation of new memories. $ (Choice F)  Disproportionate atrophy of the parietal and occipital cortices is seen in posterior cortical atrophy, an atypical variant of Alzheimer disease with prominent visual symptoms. $ Educational objective Frontotemporal dementia is associated with pronounced atrophy of the prefrontal cortex with later degeneration of the anterior temporal cortex.

  "explanation_2": "$Neuropathy is a common chronic complication of diabetes mellitus.  The clinical features of diabetic neuropathy vary considerably depending on the pattern of nerve involvement, which can be broadly divided into polyneuropathy, mononeuropathy, and autonomic neuropathy.  Mononeuropathies can also be further subdivided into cranial and peripheral types. $ All ocular motor nerves (III, IV, VI) can be affected in diabetes but unilateral cranial nerve III (CN III) involvement is most common.  #Diabetic CN III mononeuropathy# classically presents with #acute onset diplopia#.  On examination, the affected eye assumes a #\"down and out\" position# due to the unopposed pull by the superior oblique (CN IV) and lateral rectus (CN VI) muscles because all other extraocular muscles (inferior oblique and superior, inferior, and medial recti) are supplied by CN III.  #Ptosis# also occurs due to paralysis of the levator palpebrae. $ Diabetic mononeuropathy is caused by ischemic nerve damage, which predominantly involves the core of the CN III with relative sparing of the peripheral part.  The somatic component of CN III that innervates the extraocular muscles is located centrally, but the autonomic component responsible for pupillary constriction and accommodation is located in the peripheral aspect of the nerve.  Therefore, #pupillary size and reactivity is normal# in diabetic CN III mononeuropathy. $ (Choice A)  CN III neuropathy can also occur due to nerve compression.  Causes include transtentorial (uncal) herniation, neoplasms, and aneurysms of the posterior cerebral and posterior communicating arteries.  In contrast to diabetic CN III mononeuropathy, pupillary dysfunction is often an early manifestation of external nerve compression due to injury of the peripherally located parasympathetic fibers. $ #(Choices B and E)#  Neither nerve inflammation nor muscle infiltration contributes to the development of diabetic neuropathy. $ (Choice D)  Lacunar midbrain strokes can involve the CN III nuclei.  Because many neurologic pathways are densely packed in this area, CN III nuclei impairment is almost always associated with other neurologic deficits (eg, cerebellar ataxia, hemiparesis, or contralateral extrapyramidal symptoms).  In addition, the contralateral superior rectus is affected because the subnucleus fibers decussate to the contralateral side.  Midbrain lesions also cause bilateral ptosis because both levator palpebrae are innervated by a single subnucleus. $ Educational objective Diabetic mononeuropathy often involves cranial nerve III.  It is caused by predominantly central ischemia, which affects the somatic nerve fibers but spares peripheral parasympathetic fibers.  Symptoms include ptosis, a 'down and out' gaze, and normal light and accommodation reflexes."

Hypertensive vasculopathy involving the small penetrating branches of the cerebral arteries is the most common cause of deep intracranial hemorrhage.  Chronic hypertension can lead to progressive arteriolar hyalinization and fibrinoid necrosis, weakening the vessel wall and predisposing to the formation of #Charcot-Bouchard aneurysms.#  Aneurysmal rupture may ultimately lead to hemorrhage within the brain. $ The most common sites of intracranial hemorrhage are #deep brain structures#, such as the basal ganglia (putamen), cerebellar nuclei, thalamus, and pons.  #Acute neurologic deficits# can vary depending on hemorrhage location.  This patient's contralateral weakness/numbness and extensor plantar response is consistent with thalamic hemorrhage with edema/mass effect on the internal capsule.  Symptoms may worsen within minutes to hours and can be associated with headache, nausea/vomiting, or decreased level of consciousness as the hematoma expands.  Acute #bleeding# appears as hyperattenuated, or bright, lesions on #noncontrast head CT#. $ (Choices A)  Arteriovenous malformations are the most common cause of intracranial hemorrhage in children.  This patient's older age makes the diagnosis less likely. $ #(Choices B and C)#  Carotid artery atherosclerosis and cardiac embolism are 2 common causes of ischemic stroke, which can present similar to hemorrhagic stroke; however, this patient's CT shows intracranial hemorrhage (not ischemia).  Spontaneous hemorrhagic transformation of ischemic stroke would be rare within hours of symptom onset. $ (Choice D)  Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is the most common cause of lobar/cortical parenchymal hemorrhage, particularly in older adults.  This patient's deep intracranial hemorrhage makes hypertensive vasculopathy more likely. $ (Choice F)  Hypertensive encephalopathy is characterized by a #progressive# headache and nausea/vomiting followed by nonlocalizing neurologic symptoms (eg, confusion).  This patient's focal neurologic deficits and evidence of hemorrhage on CT exclude this diagnosis. $ (Choice G)  Hypoxic encephalopathy is caused by decreased oxygenation of the blood (eg, due to cardiac arrest).  It most often presents with decreased consciousness (eg, coma or vegetative state); focal neurologic deficits and intracranial hemorrhage would not be seen. $ (Choice H)  Intracranial vasculitis can lead to intraparenchymal hemorrhage but is a far less common etiology compared to hypertensive vasculopathy.  $ (Choice I)  Saccular aneurysm rupture is typically associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage as opposed to intraparenchymal hematoma.  Patients usually have an abrupt onset of severe headache (thunderclap headache), and focal neurologic deficits are less common.  On CT, subarachnoid hemorrhage appears as hyperattenuation of the sulci and basal cisterns. $ Educational objective Deep intraparenchymal hemorrhage is most commonly caused by hypertensive vasculopathy of the small penetrating branches of the cerebral arteries (Charcot-Bouchard aneurysm rupture).

The resultant injuries are due to infants' unique anatomic features.  Infants have larger heads, enlarged subarachnoid spaces, higher brain water content, and decreased cervical muscle tone compared to older children.  These factors lead to increased movement of the immature brain in relation to the skull, shearing the #bridging cortical veins# that run between the dura and arachnoid mater (subdural space).  This can result in multiple @subdural hematomas@; because AHT may occur repeatedly over weeks to months, @acute on chronic@ subdural hemorrhages are often seen. $ The shaking motion also applies shearing forces at the interface between the vitreous and the retinal vessels (vitreoretinal traction), commonly causing #bilateral retinal hemorrhage#.  Posterior #rib fractures# are another frequent manifestation due to grasping of the torso during shaking. $ (Choice B)  Although bacterial meningitis can cause lethargy and a bulging fontanelle, patients are typically febrile and bilateral retinal hemorrhages would not be expected. $ (Choice C)  Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), caused by platelet autoantibody formation, presents with petechiae, ecchymoses, and bleeding after minor trauma.  Intracranial hemorrhage is rare, and retinal hemorrhages are not seen in patients with ITP. $ (Choice D)  Although vitamin K deficiency can present with intracranial bleeding, bilateral retinal hemorrhages are not typical, and patients with bleeding due to vitamin K deficiency usually come to medical attention within a week after birth.  In addition, this patient's other red flags (eg, history inconsistent with development) are more concerning for AHT. $ (Choice E)  @Retinoblastoma@ is the most common ocular tumor of infancy and presents with absence of the red reflex on physical examination.  Lethargy, a bulging fontanelle, and retinal hemorrhage are not seen. $ (Choice F)  An accidental fall from bed-height would be generally insufficient to cause a large intracranial hemorrhage resulting in altered mental status, and would not explain this patient's retinal hemorrhages.  In addition, the history provided by this patient's parent does not match his developmental age (rolling over is not typical before age 4 months). $ Educational objective Abusive head trauma is classically caused by vigorous shaking of an infant and results in subdural hemorrhage (due to shearing of bridging cortical veins) and retinal hemorrhages (sheared retinal vessels).  Additional red flags include injuries inconsistent with history or developmental age.",

SAH usually results from the spontaneous rupture of a #saccular (berry) aneurysm#.  These aneurysms most commonly develop at @branch points@ of the anterior, middle, or posterior cerebral arteries in patients with a genetic predisposition (eg, family history, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome).  Blood empties into the subarachnoid space and #pools in the cerebral sulci and basal cisterns#, which is the diagnostic finding of SAH on @CT scan@. $ Blood in direct contact with the pia mater triggers severe headache and meningeal irritation.  Nausea, photophobia, and transient loss of consciousness are also common.  Many patients appear neurologically intact at presentation; however, progressively #deteriorating mental status# (eg, somnolence) is typical.  In addition, SAH commonly triggers delayed cerebral vasospasm (eg, 4 days after initial bleeding) resulting in stroke with focal neurologic deficits. $ (Choice B)  Diffuse cerebral edema can result from too-rapid correction of hypernatremia.  The drop in serum osmolarity stimulates water flow into brain cells, which can increase intracranial pressure to cause impaired cerebral perfusion and eventual brain herniation. $ (Choice C)  Intracerebral hemorrhage usually results from the rupture of small arteries in the pons, thalamus, or basal ganglia, commonly in the setting of underlying hypertensive vasculopathy.  The hemorrhage occurs within the brain parenchyma, with patients usually experiencing focal neurologic deficits.  Severe headache is sometimes present, but meningeal signs are not expected. $ #(Choices D and E)#  Plaque rupture and thrombosis of a large cerebral artery (eg, anterior cerebral artery) and embolization of thrombus (eg, cardioembolic thrombus due to atrial fibrillation) are common mechanisms of ischemic stroke.  Patients usually have focal neurologic deficits without headache or meningeal signs. $ Educational objective Sudden-onset, severe headache with signs of meningeal irritation (eg, neck pain, stiffness) should raise suspicion for subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).  SAH usually results from rupture of a saccular (berry) aneurysm, and it is recognized on CT scan by blood pooling in the cerebral sulci and basal cisterns.",

Vertigo resulting from vestibular dysfunction tends to be of sudden onset, interfere with walking, and cause nausea and vomiting.  Typical causes of vestibulopathy include Meniere's disease, perilymphatic fistulas, benign positional vertigo, labyrinthitis, and acoustic neuromas. $ (Choice A)  Disease of the posterior column of the spinal cord can occur in syphilis (i.e., tabes dorsalis) and vitamin B12 deficiency.  Typical symptoms include ataxia, decreased proprioception and vibratory sense, and hyporeflexia.

MRI findings in MS typically include white matter lesions scattered throughout the brain and/or spinal cord with a predilection for the subcortical @periventricular regions@. $ The pathogenesis of MS involves an autoimmune response targeting oligodendrocytes, the myelin-producing cells of the CNS.  Helper T cells abnormally react to antigens in myelin, causing a release of inflammatory cytokines (eg, interferon-gamma) that promote the infiltration of destructive macrophages/microglia and leukocytes.

  "explanation_2": "$This previously healthy patient developed #rapidly progressive dementia# associated with #myoclonus# (eg, involuntary, jerky extremity movements) and brain atrophy (due to widespread neuronal loss).  These findings are consistent with #Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease# (CJD), a rapidly fatal transmissible spongiform encephalopathy caused by prions. $ Prion protein (PrP) is found in both neuronal and nonneuronal brain cells and normally exist in an #alpha-helical# structure (PrPC).  Prion disease occurs after a domain in this protein undergoes a conformational change from an alpha helix into a #beta pleated sheet# isoform (PrPSC), which confers the ability to induce similar conformational changes in other proteins.  This beta sheet conformation is #resistant to proteases# and forms long, highly #neurotoxic fibrils# that accumulate intracellularly in neurons and form extracellular deposits. $ On microscopy, there is #spongiform degeneration# of the gray matter, which is characterized by formation of microscopic vacuoles within the neuronal processes.  This leads to widespread #neuronal loss# and reactive gliosis without associated inflammation.  This may be evident on imaging or gross pathology as widespread atrophy involving both the #cerebrum# and #cerebellum# (in contrast to many other neurodegenerative diseases that spare the cerebellum). $ (Choice A)  Cytoplasmic inclusions of alpha-synuclein are characteristic of dementia with Lewy bodies, which is characterized by visual hallucinations, parkinsonism, cognitive fluctuations, and REM sleep disorder. $ (Choice B)  Deposition of beta-amyloid occurs in Alzheimer dementia, which commonly presents with early and prominent memory impairment with language deficits and spatial disorientation.  It is characterized by a slow (years to decades) decline in function until death. $ (Choice C)  Phosphorylated tau forms paired helical filaments that create intracellular neurofibrillary tangles.  This is seen in both Alzheimer disease as well as frontotemporal dementia.  Although memory impairment and behavioral changes can occur in these diseases, this patient's myoclonus and rapid progression leading to death are more consistent with CJD. $ (Choice E)  Prion diseases are the only known diseases that are transmissible by protein.  Prion isoforms do not contain nucleic acids.  Although HIV (an RNA virus) can cause dementia, it typically causes mild, subacute cognitive impairment without myoclonus. $ Educational objective Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a prion disease characterized by rapidly progressive dementia, myoclonus, and death within a year of symptom onset.  It is caused by the accumulation of an abnormally folded (ie, beta pleated sheet) protein that is resistant to proteases and can trigger similar conformational changes in other normally folded proteins."

Because HIV does not directly infect neurons, the underlying pathology of HIV-associated dementia is thought to stem from the #release of neurotoxic compounds# by these activated monocytes. $ #(Choices A and B)#  Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is marked by beta-amyloid deposits in the walls of cortical blood vessels.  This condition is usually asymptomatic but can be associated with intracerebral hemorrhage or Alzheimer dementia.  @Alzheimer dementia@ is also associated with neuritic (senile) plaques, which are extracellular deposits of beta-amyloid surrounded by dystrophic neurites; they stain positive with Congo red and are often located in the hippocampus.  Alzheimer dementia is typically seen in older adults and is characterized by slowly progressive memory impairment and higher cortical dysfunction (eg, aphasia, agnosia, apraxia). $ (Choice C)  Patients with @rabies@ develop eosinophilic inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm of neuronal cells (Negri bodies).  Rabies is a neurotropic virus that is transmitted by the saliva of infected animals, usually via a bite wound.  Patients classically develop fever, hydrophobia (fear of water), and pharyngeal spasms. $ (Choice E)  Huntington disease is an autosomal dominant disorder that causes choreiform movement, psychiatric disturbances, and dementia.  It is characterized by severe neuronal loss in the caudate nucleus. $ (Choice F)  Lacunar infarctions cause slit-like white matter cavities with surrounding gliosis.  Recurrent lacunar infarctions can result in vascular dementia, which is often characterized by sudden/stepwise cognitive decline and focal neurologic deficits.  Patients with vascular dementia are typically older and usually have cardiovascular risk factors. $ Educational objective HIV-associated dementia should be suspected in patients with AIDS who have progressive cognitive decline.  The characteristic histopathologic finding is microglial nodules (groups of activated microglia/macrophages around small areas of necrosis) and multinucleated giant cells.",

The axons are not affected. $ (Choice D)  Beriberi (thiamine deficiency) is characterized by weakness, areflexia, pain, and paresthesias that are worse in the distal lower limbs.  Beriberi can cause demyelination of peripheral nerves; however, unlike Guillain-Barré syndrome, no endoneurial inflammation is present. $ (Choice E)  Subacute combined degeneration occurs due to vitamin B12 deficiency and leads to degeneration of dorsal columns and lateral cerebrospinal tracts.  Patients develop distal, progressive weakness and ataxia but the symptoms are slowly progressive (unlike GBS, which progresses rapidly).  In addition, subacute combined degeneration is associated with spasticity, paresthesia, and a macrocytic anemia. $ (Choice F)  Werdnig-Hoffman syndrome (spinal muscle atrophy type 1) is due to degeneration of the anterior horn cells that is caused by a mutation in the SMN1 gene.  Werdnig-Hoffman syndrome causes symmetric progressive weakness, but the weakness is more prominent proximal>distal and typically occurs in childhood. $Educational objective Guillain-Barré syndrome is an acute, demyelinating polyneuropathy thought to be caused by molecular mimicry.  Antibodies formed against infectious agents cross-react with myelin and Schwann cells, leading to immune-mediated demyelination.  Light microscopy shows segmental demyelination and an endoneurial inflammatory infiltrate composed of lymphocytes and macrophages."

It often manifests as a length-dependent #peripheral polyneuropathy# that primarily affects sensory axons; patients typically develop a #stocking-and-glove pattern# of pain or paresthesia.  Diminished pain sensation coupled with poor wound healing predisposes diabetic patients to develop #nonhealing wounds#. $ Neuronal injury in diabetes mellitus is multifactorial but largely occurs through the following mechanisms: $ • Nonenzymatic glycosylation of tissue proteins (eg, nerve, vasa nervorum) results in #hyalinization of endoneurial arterioles#, leading to narrowing of the arteriole lumens and #ischemic nerve damage#.  Additionally, glycosylation end-products are directly toxic to nerve tissue. $ • Intracellular hyperglycemia occurs in peripheral nerves and results in increased metabolism of glucose into sorbitol by aldose reductase.  Sorbitol accumulation increases cell osmolality, facilitates water influx into the cell, and #promotes oxidative stress# within the nerve. $ (Choice B)  Endoneurial inflammatory infiltration of the peripheral nerves is characteristic of Guillain-Barré syndrome, which typically causes a rapidly progressive ascending paralysis rather than a slowly progressive paresthesia.  Segmental demyelination is another typical pathologic finding. $ (Choice C)  Myelin protein gene mutations are involved in the pathogenesis of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, which presents with weakness of foot dorsiflexion due to involvement of the common peroneal nerve; sensory symptoms are typically less prominent. $ (Choice D)  Entrapment of a nerve within an anatomic compartment leads to compression neuropathy.  The most common example is carpal tunnel syndrome, which occurs due to compression of the median nerve at the wrist. $ (Choice E)  Abnormal signal transmission at the neuromuscular junction is characteristic of myasthenia gravis (MG), which occurs due to antibodies against acetylcholine receptors, and Lambert-Eaton syndrome (LES), which occurs due to antibodies against presynaptic calcium channels.  MG causes fatigable weakness that is most prominent in the proximal and facial muscles, while LES results in weakness that improves with repetition. $ Educational objective Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is characterized by numbness and paresthesia in a stocking-and-glove distribution.

Although repeated vascular events could result in a stepwise progressive loss in neurologic function, this process would most likely occur over several years and affect multiple vascular territories throughout the brain (causing a wide range of neurologic deficits).

  "explanation_2": "Sometimes axons become severed due to trauma.  Such injury causes specific changes in both the proximal and distal segments of the axon, as well as in the neuronal body. $ Wallerian degeneration occurs in the segment of axon that has lost connection with the cell body.  It represents the degeneration of axon and myelin distal to a point of injury.  First, swelling and irregularity are noted in the distal segment of the axon.  Within a week the axon is destroyed and its fragments are digested by Schwann cells and macrophages.  Similar degenerative changes occur in the segment of axon that lies proximal to the injury.  Degeneration of the proximal segment extends to the closest node of Ranvier. $ The changes seen in the neuronal body after the axon is severed are called #axonal reaction#.  The cell body shows signs of cellular edema.  It becomes swollen and rounded, with the nucleus displaced to the periphery.  Nissl substance becomes fine, granular and dispersed throughout the cytoplasm (central chromatolysis).  Axonal reaction becomes visible in 24-48 hours after the injury.  Maximal changes in the neuronal body occur approximately 12 days after the injury.  These changes reflect an increased synthesis of protein by the cells in order to regenerate the severed axon. $ (Choice A)  Degenerative diseases are characterized by progressive loss of neurons with associated reactive glial changes.  Neuronal loss in these conditions is selective: it affects one or more well-defined neuronal groups.  Alzheimer's, Pick's, and Huntington's disease are all examples of degenerative disorders. $ (Choice B)  Transient but profound hypoxia, ischemia or toxic injury may lead to the loss of neurons.  Irreversible neuronal injury manifests with shrinkage of the neuronal body, deep eosinophilia of the cytoplasm, pyknosis of the nucleus and loss of Nissl substance. $ (Choice D)  Compression atrophy may occur due to increased intracranial pressure or a mass lesion.  A decrease in the size and number of neurons is characteristic of compression atrophy. $ (Choice E)  Normal aging is characterized by atrophy and gradual neuronal loss.  Axonal reaction is not associated with this process. $ Educational Objective The changes in the body of a neuron after the axon has been severed are called axonal reaction.

Abnormal prolactin secretion can also occur in nonprolactinoma tumors because, unlike secretion of other pituitary hormones, prolactin secretion is under @negative regulation by dopamine@ from the hypothalamus; any disruption of dopaminergic pathways in the pituitary stalk can cause a moderate increase in prolactin release. $ (Choice A)  Aldosterone is produced in the adrenal cortex, not the pituitary.  It is regulated primarily by the renin-angiotensin system. $ (Choice B)  Circulating catecholamines arise primarily from the adrenal medulla and, to a lesser extent, from spillover from sympathetic nervous system synapses.  Neuroendocrine tumors (eg, pheochromocytoma) can cause excess catecholamine release. $ (Choice C)  Most gonadotroph adenomas are hormonally nonfunctioning; ovarian hyperstimulation with an elevated estradiol level is uncommon.  In addition, prolactinomas commonly cause central hypogonadism with low estradiol levels due to @suppression of GnRH release@ from the hypothalamus. $ (Choice D)  The effects of growth hormone (GH) are largely mediated by insulin-like growth factor-1, which is produced in the liver in response to GH.  However, somatotroph adenomas (ie, GH-secreting tumors) are relatively rare and significantly less common than prolactin-secreting adenomas. $ (Choice E)  Melatonin is produced by the pineal gland and regulates circadian rhythm. $ (Choice G)  Vasopressin is produced in the hypothalamus and released by the posterior pituitary.

This, along with her prior episodes of optic neuritis (transient blurred vision and eye pain with movement), raises concern for #multiple sclerosis (MS)#, a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) caused by an autoimmune response directed at oligodendrocytes. $ In unmyelinated neurons, signal transmission requires sequential activation of adjacent sodium channels down the entire length of the axon.  In myelinated neurons, the depolarization impulse is regenerated at discrete points along the axon (nodes of Ranvier) where sodium channels are concentrated.  The myelin sheath serves as an electrical insulator that results in the impulse 'jumping' between 2 adjacent nodes #(saltatory conduction)#.  This process allows for myelinated neurons to transmit impulses >10x faster than unmyelinated neurons. $ Due to the #acute demyelination# seen with MS, propagation of the impulse cannot occur, as the distance between the sodium channels at the nodes of Ranvier precludes sequential activation.  This causes a #conduction block#.  Over time, sodium channels eventually redistribute across the naked axon and surviving oligodendrocytes partially remyelinate neurons, allowing for some restoration of signal transmission (explaining why some of the symptoms and signs of MS resolve to a variable extent). $ (Choice A)  Impaired neuromuscular transmission can be seen in myasthenia gravis, which is caused by autoantibodies against acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction.  Affected patients typically present with fluctuating diplopia, ptosis, and/or bulbar muscle weakness. $ (Choice B)  Loss of axons and neurons occurs over time in chronic multiple sclerosis plaques.

Muscle disorders rarely follow a relapsing-remitting course and are not associated with optic neuritis or internuclear ophthalmoplegia. $ (Choice D)  Optic nerve compression would most likely result in progressive vision loss.

The dynamic balance between production and absorption of CSF allows stable intracranial volume (120-150 ml) and pressure (50-180 mm H2O). $ If the normal flow of CSF from the ventriculi to the subarachnoid space is disrupted, #non-communicating hydrocephalus# occurs.

Because of this, they develop in the brain parenchyma rather than an extraaxial location. $ (Choice C)  Ependymomas arise from the ependymal lining of the ventricles, often from the roof of the fourth ventricle in children or the intramedullary space of the spinal cord in adults.  They would not be located in the cerebellopontine angle.  In addition, intracranial ependymomas typically present with progressive headaches and signs of increased intracranial pressure due to obstructive hydrocephalus. $ (Choice D)  @Medulloblastomas@ typically present in children (most commonly age 5-9) with vomiting, headache, and cerebellar dysfunction.  They are typically located along the cerebellar midline (rather than the cerebellopontine angle) and may compresses the fourth ventricle, causing obstructive hydrocephalus and increased intracranial pressure. $ Educational objective Tumors at the cerebellopontine angle can cause unilateral progressive hearing loss due to compression of the vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII).  These tumors are most likely vestibular schwannomas or meningiomas; histologic analysis is often required to differentiate between them.",

Diabetes mellitus is the most common cause of peripheral neuropathy in adults.  The risk of neuropathy and other #microvascular complications# (eg, retinopathy, nephropathy) is increased in longstanding, poorly controlled diabetes; tight glycemic control can decrease the risk. $ Neuronal injury occurs due to accumulation of advanced glycosylation end products, sorbitol, and other toxic substances that lead to deranged metabolism and increased oxidative stress.  In addition, diabetic microangiopathy affecting the endoneurial vessels can promote nerve ischemia.  This, in combination with the metabolic disturbances, leads to a #length-dependent axonopathy#, with clinical features occurring first in the longest nerves (eg, feet); symptoms vary depending on the type of nerve fibers involved: $ • #Small-fiber# injury is characterized by predominance of #positive symptoms# (eg, pain, paresthesias, allodynia). $ • #Large-fiber# involvement is characterized by predominance of #negative symptoms# (eg, numbness, loss of proprioception and vibration sense, sensory ataxia [eg, positive Romberg sign], diminished ankle reflexes). $ Patients with diabetes can also develop autonomic neuropathy, manifesting as gastrointestinal disturbances (eg, gastroparesis), orthostatic symptoms, bladder dysfunction, and erectile dysfunction.  Degeneration of motor axons may also occur, leading to unbalanced strength in the extremities and @hammer or claw toe deformities@. $ (Choice A)  C-fibers are small, unmyelinated fibers that carry pain and temperature sensation.  Diabetes can damage these fibers, leading to a reduction in pain/temperature sensation as well as burning pain.  Numbness, tingling paresthesias, diminished reflexes, and sensory ataxia are more consistent with large-fiber neuropathy. $ (Choice C)  Nerve root dysfunction (ie, radiculopathy) is most commonly due to compression from disc herniation or degenerative changes in the vertebral column.  The associated pain/numbness is in a dermatomal (rather than stocking-glove) distribution and is often associated with muscular weakness and atrophy. $ (Choice D)  Guillain-Barré syndrome is an immune-mediated polyneuropathy caused by demyelination of peripheral nerve fibers.  It can cause paresthesias and neuropathic pain but typically presents with rapidly progressive ascending weakness.  Most patients have a preceding respiratory or gastrointestinal infection (eg, Campylobacter). $ (Choice E)  Subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord results from chronic vitamin B12 deficiency.

Space-occupying intracranial lesions classically present with a headache that is worse in the morning and with Valsalva (eg, bearing down, coughing) due to increased intracranial pressure. $ The facial nerve exits the @brainstem@ at the pontomedullary junction and subsequently enters the internal auditory meatus and facial canal in the temporal bone.  Here, it gives off branches that supply the stapedius muscle (reduces volume by dampening ossicle movement in middle ear), salivary glands (eg, sublingual, submandibular), and lacrimal glands.  It also provides taste from the anterior two thirds of the tongue via the chorda tympani nerve.  After exiting the skull through the stylomastoid foramen, the facial nerve courses within the parotid gland and its terminal branches innervate the muscles of facial expression. $ Facial nerve palsy presents with ipsilateral @facial paralysis@ (eg, flattening of the nasolabial fold, drooping of the lower lip, inability to close the eye).

  "explanation_2": "#Subarachnoid hemorrhage# (SAH) is a life-threatening condition that most commonly results from rupture of a saccular (berry) aneurysm.  It classically manifests with the abrupt onset of severe headache #(thunderclap headache)#; confusion, loss of consciousness, and meningismus may also occur.  Noncontrast head CT scan reveals blood in the subarachnoid space (between the arachnoid and pia mater). $ If the patient survives the initial SAH, a number of complications (eg, rebleeding, hydrocephalus, seizures) may occur in the following days to weeks.  The most common is #arterial vasospasm#, which occurs due to the release of vasoconstrictive factors from damaged erythrocytes in the subarachnoid space and the inability of damaged vascular endothelial cells to produce vasodilators (eg, nitric oxide).  The resultant unopposed vasoconstriction can cause #delayed cerebral ischemia#, which manifests as a change in mental status and/or new #focal neurological deficits# 3-12 days after the SAH. $ #CT scan# usually reveals #no significant changes# despite the severity of the ischemia following vasospasm.  Nimodipine, a selective calcium channel blocker, is used after SAH to promote vasodilation and prevent calcium-dependent excitotoxicity, which improves outcomes by reducing the incidence and extent of ischemia due to cerebral vasospasm. $ #(Choices A, B, and E)# Although arterial thrombosis, embolism, and vascular inflammation could all cause a change in mental status and focal neurologic deficits, they are not significant complications of SAH. $ (Choice C)  Hydrocephalus may occur hours to days after SAH due to blood breakdown products obstructing the flow of cerebrospinal fluid or clogging the arachnoid villi.  Patients develop signs of elevated intracranial pressure (eg, nausea/vomiting), and neuroimaging demonstrates ventricular dilation. $ (Choice D)  Rebleeding after initial SAH carries a high mortality rate and usually occurs early (<24 hours) after the initial bleed.  Although symptoms can include a sudden change in level of consciousness and appearance of new neurological deficits, rebleeding is very rare 4 days after a successfully repaired aneurysmal rupture and CT scan would demonstrate newly extravasated blood. $ Educational objective The most common complication of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage is vasospasm, which typically occurs 3-12 days after the initial insult and can cause delayed cerebral ischemia (eg, sudden change in mental status, new focal neurological deficits).  The CT scan usually remains unchanged, unlike with rebleeding."

  "explanation_2": "$#Myasthenia gravis# (MG) is an acquired autoimmune disorder characterized by fatigable, fluctuating weakness of the skeletal muscles.  The most commonly affected muscles include #ocular# (diplopia, ptosis), bulbar (dysarthria, fatigable chewing), facial (loss of smile), and proximal (#neck/shoulder weakness#) muscles.  However, #respiratory failure# (↓ pH, ↑ pCO2, ↓ O2) can also occur due to diaphragmatic weakness (ie, myasthenic crisis), and may be the presenting symptom in some patients. $ MG is caused by an autoantibody-mediated, T cell–dependent attack on the acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) of the postsynaptic neuromuscular junction. #Antibody-mediated blockade# of the active site of AChRs prevents acetylcholine from binding and also triggers #endocytosis# of AChRs (receptor internalization) as well as #complement-mediated membrane damage#.  Over time, these changes result in #reduced numbers of AchRs# and impaired neuromuscular transmission. $ (Choice A)  @Botulinum toxin@ irreversibly blocks acetylcholine release from presynaptic membranes of neuromuscular junctions.  After exposure to the toxin, patients may develop cranial nerve abnormalities (including ptosis and facial weakness), symmetric descending weakness, and respiratory failure.  However, autonomic abnormalities are common, and symptoms are rapidly progressive (hours rather than weeks) and do not worsen with repetition. $ #(Choices B and E)#  The @action of acetylcholine@ at the postsynaptic membrane is terminated by acetylcholinesterase, not by acetylcholine reuptake.  Organophosphates (eg, pesticides, sarin gas) irreversibly inactivate acetylcholinesterase, causing cholinergic toxicity (eg, increased glandular secretions, widespread smooth muscle activation).  Muscle weakness, including respiratory failure, can occur due to depolarizing blockade at the neuromuscular junction; however, other symptoms (eg, diarrhea, urination, miosis, bradycardia, emesis, salivation) would be expected. $ (Choice C)  @Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome@ is due to autoantibodies directed against the voltage-gated calcium channels on presynaptic nerve terminals, leading to reduced calcium entry and impaired acetylcholine release.  This syndrome commonly occurs in association with malignancy, particularly small cell lung cancer (which would be atypical in this young female), and generally causes proximal extremity weakness that is worse in the mornings and #improves# with repetition.  Autonomic findings (eg, dry mouth, erectile dysfunction in males) are frequently seen and can be an important clue to diagnosis. $ Educational objective Myasthenia gravis is caused by an autoantibody-mediated attack on the acetylcholine receptors of the postsynaptic neuromuscular junction, leading to a reduced number of acetylcholine receptors.  It is characterized by fatigable weakness of the skeletal muscles; respiratory failure can occur due to diaphragmatic weakness.",

  "explanation_2": "Voluntary muscle activity is mediated by the #corticospinal (pyramidal) tracts#.  First-order neurons of these tracts are located in the premotor and motor cortex of the frontal lobe (Brodmann areas 6 and 4, respectively).  Their efferent fibers descend through the internal capsule, midbrain, and pons, and continue to form the pyramids on the anterior aspect of the medulla.  In the medulla, 90% of the fibers decussate (cross) to form the @lateral corticospinal tract@.  Fibers that do not decussate descend as the @anterior corticospinal tract@.  The axons of both tracts synapse on the motor neurons of the anterior horn (second-order neurons).  Damage to the corticospinal tract is divided into upper and lower motor neuron lesions: $ 1. #Upper motor neuron# (UMN) refers to anything above the anterior horn.  Lesions to UMNs (eg, due to stroke, brain tumor) cause a combination of #spastic paralysis#, clasp-knife #rigidity, hyperreflexia# (including clonus), and upgoing plantar reflexes (#Babinski sign#).  This likely occurs due to loss of descending inhibition over second-order neurons in the anterior horn. $ 2. Damage to the motor neurons of the anterior horn is considered a lower motor neuron (LMN) lesion.  This type of injury leads to flaccid paralysis, hypotonia, hyporeflexia, muscle atrophy, and fasciculations.  Poliomyelitis and infantile spinal muscular atrophy are examples of LMN lesions #(choices B, C, and D)#. $ Combined UMN and LMN lesions are characteristic of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig disease). $ (Choice E)  Resting tremor is characteristic of Parkinson disease, which occurs due to loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. $ (Choice F)  Sensory information is transmitted by the spinothalamic tract (pain and temperature) and dorsal column pathway (vibration and proprioception).  Lesions to the corticospinal tract do not cause sensory deficits. $ Educational objective Upper motor neuron damage leads to spastic paralysis, hyperreflexia, and an upgoing plantar reflex (Babinski sign) due to loss of descending inhibition over lower motor neurons in the anterior horn.

MS is an autoimmune disorder of the #central nervous system# (CNS) characterized by lesions of focal #demyelination#. $ Demyelination involves both cellular and humoral immunity.  Helper T cells react with myelin antigens and recruit additional lymphocytes and macrophages.  Activated CD8+ T cells release cytotoxic granules that injure oligodendrocytes.  B cell recruitment leads to the formation of myelin-specific antibodies that activate complement and facilitate myelin breakdown.  The result is #oligodendrocyte depletion# with relative sparing of axons.  $Diagnosis is largely clinical but is supported by the presence of T2 lesions on MRI (precluded in this patient due to the presence of intraocular metal) or #oligoclonal bands# on cerebrospinal fluid analysis.  Oligoclonal bands represent the intrathecal production of immunoglobulins and are highly sensitive for MS.  However, oligoclonal bands are nonspecific and may be seen in any CNS disease involving humoral immunity (eg, vasculitis, infection). $ (Choice A)  Astrocytes undergo hypertrophy and hyperplasia, not shrinkage, in response to CNS injury in a process known as glial scarring. $ #(Choices B and C)#  Both Lewy body dementia and Alzheimer disease are characterized by protein aggregates in brain tissue.  Lewy body dementia causes visual hallucinations, dysautonomia, and parkinsonism and is characterized by eosinophilic inclusions in neurons (Lewy bodies).  Alzheimer disease causes progressive memory loss and is characterized by extracellular fibrillar protein accumulation (amyloid).  Both diseases are uncommon in young patients and are not associated with focal neurologic deficits.  $(Choice D)  Cerebral vasculitis can resemble MS with neurologic deficits that may wax and wane, and oligoclonal bands can be seen.  However, patients typically develop severe headache, and systemic symptoms (eg, fever, fatigue, night sweats) are common. $ (Choice E)  Intracerebral hemorrhaging can cause focal deficits, but symptoms would likely have an acute rather than intermittent or relapsing presentation.  In addition, lumbar puncture would typically show xanthochromia (yellow-tinged cerebrospinal fluid from blood product breakdown), not a mononuclear pleocytosis. $ Educational objective Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune demyelinating disease that results from oligodendrocyte depletion.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient with impaired memory and cognition, unsteady gait, and urinary incontinence has @ventriculomegaly@ without sulcal enlargement on MRI, which is characteristic of #normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH)#.  NPH can occur due to decreased absorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by the arachnoid granulations (eg, fibrosis from previous cerebral inflammation or bleeding) with gradual accumulation of CSF in the ventricular system.  The lateral ventricles expand, resulting in normal intracranial pressure and #stretching the descending cortical fibers# (corona radiata).  Interruption of these pathways, along with impairment of cortical and subcortical function, leads to the classic triad of NPH symptoms (#dementia, gait disturbance, urinary incontinence#). $ The cerebral cortex (through the pontine micturition center) regulates the @micturition reflex@, which is an autonomic spinal reflex mediated by the neurons in the sacral spinal cord.  In NPH, the #lack of cortical inhibition# results in #detrusor muscle hyperactivity#.  This leads to urinary urgency, which can be worsened by gait abnormalities that limit a patient's ability to quickly get to a bathroom (#urge incontinence#).  Progressive frontal lobe impairment leads to the inability to recognize urinary urge, uncontrolled urination, and a lack of concern as the disease progresses. $ (Choice A)  Cerebellar dysfunction can cause an ataxic gait, dysarthria, and intention tremors.  Memory dysfunction and urinary incontinence are more indicative of cerebral impairment.  NPH typically spares cerebellar function. $ (Choice B)  Compression of the reticular formation can occur with brainstem herniation, leading to loss of consciousness and coma. $ (Choice C)  Impaired basal ganglia signaling is characteristic of Parkinson disease, which can result in ataxia with a slow gait.  However, cogwheel rigidity and resting tremor would be prominent and dementia and urinary incontinence would not be expected until later in the disease course. $ (Choice D)  Spinal cord damage is a common cause of incontinence with gait impairment.  However, spinal cord injury also frequently causes lower extremity weakness and is not associated with cognitive impairment. $ Educational objective Normal pressure hydrocephalus occurs due to decreased cerebrospinal fluid absorption, resulting in ventriculomegaly with normal intracranial pressure.  This causes stretching of the descending cortical fibers (corona radiata) from the frontal lobe and contributes to the classic triad of symptoms (ie, dementia, gait abnormalities, urinary incontinence).

  "explanation_2": "$This patient with a worsening neurologic status has enlargement of the ventricles on CT scan, consistent with #hydrocephalus#, a common complication of #subarachnoid hemorrhage# (SAH).  Blood in the subarachnoid space can acutely obstruct and #impair absorption# of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) by the #arachnoid granulations#.  Later, blood-induced inflammation can cause fibrosis of the arachnoid granulations that perpetuates the absorption impairment and leads to chronic hydrocephalus. $ Impaired CSF absorption creates a #communicating# hydrocephalus.  Because the blockage to flow is distal to the entire @ventricular system@, #enlargement of all 4 ventricles# occurs.  The ventricular enlargement stretches adjacent nerve fibers and, in the acute setting, leads to #deteriorating mental status# (eg, somnolence, unresponsiveness).  Treatment involves the placement of an @external ventricular drain@ to relieve pressure in the ventricular system and subarachnoid space. $ (Choice A)  Blockage of the cerebral aqueduct (aqueduct of Sylvius) is less common with SAH and more typically occurs with intracerebral hemorrhage complicated by intraventricular bleeding.  The resulting hydrocephalus is noncommunicating because there is no free passage of CSF from the ventricular space into the subarachnoid space.  Enlargement of only the lateral and third ventricles is expected; the fourth ventricle is distal to the obstruction and remains normal in size. $ (Choice B)  Cerebral vasospasm is a common complication of SAH; however, it is typically delayed, occurring 4-14 days following the initial bleed, and leads to localized stroke with focal neurologic deficits rather than deteriorating mental status.  Dilated ventricles are not seen. $ (Choice C)  Edema that occurs due to disruption of the blood-brain barrier (vasogenic cerebral edema) collects within the brain parenchyma and can result from stroke or trauma.  It is not expected following SAH. $ (Choice D)  Excessive CSF production is a rare cause of communicating hydrocephalus that may result from a choroid plexus papilloma.  Enlargement of all 4 ventricles is expected, but this patient's SAH makes impaired absorption of CSF far more likely. $ Educational objective Communicating hydrocephalus is a common complication of subarachnoid hemorrhage that presents with deteriorating mental status.  It typically results from blood-induced impairment of absorption of cerebrospinal fluid by the arachnoid granulations.",

In syringomyelia, a cerebrospinal fluid-filled cavity called a syrinx usually forms in the cervical region of the spinal cord.  These cavities can enlarge over time and destroy adjacent portions of the spinal cord.  The areas most commonly damaged are the ventral white commissure and ventral horns. $ The ventral white commissure is located just anterior to the gray commissure.  It is the area of decussation for the fibers of the @lateral spinothalamic tract@, which transmits pain and temperature sensation from peripheral receptors to the somatosensory cortex.  Destruction of the #ventral white commissure# leads to loss of pain and temperature sensation bilaterally over the affected dermatomes (starting 1 to 2 levels below the lesion, as the axons briefly ascend in the zone of Lissauer before decussating).  Touch, vibration, and position senses are preserved as the dorsal columns remain intact. $ (Choice B)  The ventral horns contain lower motor neurons that receive impulses from the lateral corticospinal tract.  Damage to the ventral horn can occur in syringomyelia, but would cause flaccid paralysis and atrophy of the intrinsic hand muscles (not loss of pain and temperature sensation). $ (Choice C)  The ventral spinothalamic tract is located in this area and transmits crude touch and pressure sensation.  It should not be confused with the lateral spinothalamic tract, which carries pain and temperature sensation. $ (Choice D)  After decussating in the ventral white commissure, axons of the lateral spinothalamic tract ascend to the brain in the lateral funiculus.  Damage to this area would cause contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation distally, beginning 1 to 2 segments below the lesion.  However, bilateral sensory loss would not occur with damage to this area. $ (Choice E)  The dorsal horn contains first order axons and second order neurons that transmit sensory input from peripheral receptors.  Damage to the dorsal horn would likely result in unilateral loss of all sensation over the affected dermatomes. $ (Choice F)  The dorsal column contains both the gracile and cuneate fasciculi.  They are formed by axons of first-order neurons of the dorsal column pathway.  This tract is the primary mediator of proprioception, vibration, and tactile sensation. $ Educational objective Syringomyelia is characterized by the formation of a cavity (syrinx) in the cervical region of the spinal cord.  The syrinx damages the ventral white commissure, leading to bilateral loss of pain and temperature sensation that is limited to the affected levels (typically the arms and hands); distal sensation is preserved.

  "explanation_2": "$#Wallerian degeneration# refers to the process that occurs when an axon is damaged, resulting in axonal degeneration and breakdown of the myelin sheath #distal to the site of injury#.  Degeneration of the axon usually begins within a few days after lesion onset. $ In the peripheral nervous system, Schwann cells sense the axonal degeneration and begin to degrade their myelin and secrete cytokines and chemokines that recruit macrophages.  This allows effective clearance of myelin debris which, along with trophic factor secretion by Schwann cells, stimulates formation of a growth cone from the stump of the proximal axon and facilitates nerve regeneration. $ In the #central nervous system#, phagocytic macrophages/microglia are recruited more slowly because of the blood-brain barrier.  Myelin-producing oligodendrocytes also become inactive or undergo apoptosis and do not assist with phagocytosis.  This slows removal of the #myelin debris#, which can #persist for years# in the degenerating tracts and suppress axonal growth via myelin-associated inhibitory factors.  Astrocytes also release inhibitory molecules and proliferate in the weeks to months following injury, forming a #glial scar# that acts as a #barrier# to axon regeneration. $ (Choice A)  Calcification of an ischemic infarction may occur months to years after the event; however, this is a rare occurrence.  Brain calcification is most commonly seen with certain neoplasms (eg, oligodendroglioma), infections (eg, neurocysticercosis), and vascular malformations. $ #(Choices B and G)#  Cytotoxic and vasogenic edema typically occur in the acute setting after ischemic neuronal injury.  Cytotoxic edema is a type of intracellular edema caused by impaired function of ATP-dependent sodium/potassium pumps on neuronal cell membranes.  In contrast, vasogenic edema is a type of extracellular edema caused by increased vascular permeability due to the effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines. $ (Choice C)  In the first 12-24 hours after ischemic stroke, affected neurons classically shrink and develop intense cytoplasmic eosinophilia (red neurons) with pyknosis of the nucleus. $ (Choice D)  Embolic ischemic strokes have a high risk of undergoing acute hemorrhagic transformation within the first 7 days following the ischemic event. $ (Choice E)  Neutrophilic infiltration progressively increases up to 48 hours after ischemic stroke and then diminishes. $ Educational objective Wallerian degeneration refers to the process of axonal degeneration and breakdown of the myelin sheath that occurs distal to a site of injury.  Axonal regeneration does not occur in the central nervous system due to the persistence of myelin debris, secretion of neuronal inhibitory factors, and development of dense glial scarring."

With further hemorrhagic expansion, horizontal shifts in midline structures or #brain herniation# may occur. $ Progressive pupillary abnormalities are common in herniation.  @Uncal herniation@ initially disrupts the ipsilateral oculomotor nerve (CN III) leading to a #fixed dilated pupil#; however, as the brainstem becomes inferiorly displaced (ie, #central herniation#), damage to the midbrain and upper pons typically results in bilateral #midpositioned and fixed pupils# due to loss of both sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation. $ Brain herniation also causes abnormal posturing from disruption of descending tracts (eg, rubrospinal, vestibulospinal) typically involved in reflexive and postural movements.  The vestibulospinal tract maintains extensor tone and originates from vestibular nuclei at the pontomedullary junction.

It is the most common cause of dementia and usually affects people > 60 years of age.  Language deficits (word-finding difficulty) and impaired visuospatial ability (misplacement of items) can occur early in the course of the disease.  Later, as impairment in executive function and associated behavioral abnormalities become more pronounced, patients can have trouble performing everyday functions (eg, shopping, cooking, and managing money). $Advanced Alzheimer's disease is associated with diffuse brain atrophy.  Atrophy is most pronounced in the temporoparietal lobes and hippocampus.  Hippocampal atrophy is evident even in the early stages of the disease and can be detected by brain MRI. $The cerebellum #(Choice B)#, corpus callosum #(Choice C)#, pons #(Choice D)#, and thalamus #(Choice E) #are not obviously atrophied in Alzheimer's disease. $#Educational objective#The hippocampus is the area of the @brain@ demonstrating the greatest degree of atrophy in Alzheimer's disease.

  "explanation_2": "$This woman with recent #gait impairment# likely died due to a head injury from a fall (scalp bruising); her anticoagulation therapy placed her at increased risk for intracranial hemorrhage and subsequent brain herniation.  Evidence of #myelin degeneration# in the #dorsal columns# and #lateral corticospinal tracts# on autopsy is suspicious for vitamin B12 deficiency, the likely cause of her ataxia. $#Vitamin B12# #deficiency# is classically associated with megaloblastic anemia due to impaired DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing hematologic cells.  However, vitamin B12 is also essential for myelin generation and maintenance (via methylation of myelin basic protein); deficiency often results in neurologic symptoms due to impaired myelination in the following regions: $#Dorsal columns#:  diminished tactile/vibratory sensation and proprioception, resulting in #sensory ataxia# (eg, Romberg sign) $#Lateral corticospinal tracts#:  upper motor neuron signs (eg, muscle weakness, spastic paresis), Babinski reflex $Spinocerebellar tracts:  ataxia (loss of unconscious proprioception) $Peripheral nerves:  numbness, paresthesia, hyporeflexia $The pattern of spinal cord damage is referred to as #subacute combined degeneration#, given the degeneration of both ascending (dorsal columns, spinocerebellar tracts) and descending (lateral corticospinal tracts) pathways. $#(Choice A)#  Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects upper and lower motor neurons.  Damage to the lateral corticospinal tract occurs, but anterior horn damage is also characteristic and not seen in this woman.  Moreover, sensory pathways are usually spared, so dorsal column damage would not be expected. $#(Choice B)#  Multiple sclerosis is marked by asymmetric, focal areas of CNS demyelination.  This woman's symmetric damage to specific spinal cord tracts would be atypical. $#(Choice C)#  Syringomyelia, a cyst within the spinal cord, can lead to central spinal cord injury involving crossing fibers from the spinothalamic tracts within the anterior white commissure.  This woman's autopsy did not reveal a cyst, and extensive dorsal column damage would be unusual. $#(Choice D)#  Tabes dorsales (neurosyphilis) is associated with damage to the dorsal columns and dorsal nerve roots; however, the lateral corticospinal tracts are generally not affected. $#(Choice E)#  Thiamine deficiency causes Wernicke encephalopathy (ataxia, confusion, oculomotor dysfunction).  Unlike in this woman, histopathology shows demyelination in the brain (eg, mammillary bodies, thalamus), not the spinal cord. $#Educational objective# Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) deficiency can cause subacute combined degeneration due to impaired myelination in the ascending dorsal columns and spinocerebellar tracts (diminished position/vibration sense, ataxia), as well as the descending lateral corticospinal tracts (eg, muscle weakness, spastic paresis).

Microscopically, they appear @biphasic@ with highly cellular areas (Antoni A pattern) intermixed with myxoid regions of low cellularity (Antoni B pattern).  The Antoni A areas are composed of spindle cells with #elongated, wavy nuclei# that form palisading patterns with interspersing nuclear-free zones called Verocay bodies.  Schwannomas are universally #S-100 positive# due to their neural crest cell origin.  Another important S-100 positive tumor is melanoma (also derived from the neural crest). $Schwann cells are to the peripheral nervous system as oligodendrocytes are to the central nervous system:  both protect and insulate axons.  The transition from oligodendrocytes to Schwann cells occurs within a few millimeters from the surface of the brain and spinal cord.  Therefore, schwannomas can occur within the cranial vault and spinal canal.  Schwannomas may arise from any cranial nerve except the optic nerve (CN II) and olfactory nerve (CN I), which are not covered by Schwann cells. $The most common site of intracranial schwannomas is the #cerebellopontine angle# at CN VIII.  Schwannomas in this particular location are also called acoustic neuromas, and can present with #tinnitus, vertigo#, and sensorineural #hearing loss#. $#(Choice A)#  @Glioblastoma@ is a highly aggressive primary brain tumor that consists of bizarre-looking glial cells with multiple mitotic figures, pseudopalisading necrosis, and abundant neovascularization and hemorrhage.  It commonly occurs in the frontotemporoparietal white matter and grows along the white matter tracts across the corpus callosum to affect the opposite hemisphere. $#(Choice B)#  @Meningiomas@ are typically slow-growing extra-axial tumors that arise from the meningothelial cells of the arachnoid.  Meningiomas most commonly appear as cells arranged in lobules or whorls with or without psammoma bodies (laminar calcifications). $#(Choice C)#  Brain metastases are the most common cause of intracranial tumors in adults.  Lung, breast, skin (melanoma), and renal cancer are particularly likely to metastasize to the brain.  Metastatic brain lesions typically form well-circumscribed masses along the grey-white junction.  Histologically, there is often necrosis with surrounding areas of reactive gliosis and edema. $#(Choice D)#  Optic glioma is a form of glioma that affects the optic nerve.  It is often found in association with neurofibromatosis type 1.  Histologic findings are usually consistent with pilocytic astrocytoma and include tumor cells with hairlike processes, microcystic areas, and Rosenthal fibers (elongated or corkscrew intracytoplasmic eosinophilic bundles). $#Educational objective# Schwannomas present histologically with a biphasic pattern of cellularity (Antoni A and B areas) and S-100 positivity (indicating neural crest origin).

  "explanation_2": "$This patient had a right hemispheric #ischemic stroke# and developed altered mental status and increased intracranial pressure (ICP) secondary to #cerebral edema#.  The fixed volume of the skull necessitates that a significant increase in volume of any component of the CNS (eg, brain tissue, blood, cerebrospinal fluid) will raise ICP.  This increased ICP can cause progressive #neurologic impairment# through direct pressure-induced cell injury or mechanical damage due to @brain herniation@. $Irreversible ischemic neural and glial cell injury initiates a sequence of chemical changes that promote edema: $•#Cytotoxic (ionic) edema# begins hours after the ischemic injury due to decreased ATP.  The failure of #ATP-dependent ion pumps#, combined with the release of excitatory amino acids (eg, glutamate), leads to the accumulation of intracellular Na+ and water in neural and glial cells despite an intact blood-brain barrier. $•#Vasogenic edema# follows 24-48 hours later, when the release of inflammatory mediators disrupts the tight junctions of the blood-brain barrier, allowing proteins (eg, albumin) and water to enter the interstitial space.  This vasogenic phase can cause persistent cerebral edema for weeks after the initial injury. $#(Choice A)#  Although a decrease in oncotic pressure can cause peripheral edema (eg, nephrotic syndrome), it is not a significant factor in the development of cerebral edema.  Mannitol is used in the treatment of cerebral edema because it increases plasma oncotic pressure and temporarily disrupts the blood-brain barrier, allowing movement of fluid out of the CNS to decrease ICP. $#(Choice C)#  Inadequate absorption of cerebrospinal fluid at the arachnoid granulations can cause communicating hydrocephalus.  Although this process raises ICP, ventriculomegaly would likely be prominent on CT scan. $#(Choice D)#  Increased hydrostatic pressure secondary to central venous thrombosis or hypertensive encephalopathy can cause cerebral edema and increased ICP.  However, patients typically have gradually worsening headache before development of neurologic abnormalities. $#(Choice E)#  Gliosis is the process of repairing damaged tissue in the CNS by proliferating astrocytes and microglia.  This process occurs slowly in the months to years after CNS injury and would not be expected to cause acute changes in ICP. $#Educational objective# The primary mechanism underlying cytotoxic (early) edema following cerebral ischemia is the accumulation of intracellular Na+ and water due to the failure of ATP-dependent ion transporters in hypoxic cells.  Cerebral edema causes progressive neurologic decline by raising intracranial pressure, which can directly damage neural tissue or result in mechanical damage due to brain herniation.",

This, in conjunction with this patient's prior episode of blurred vision and her severe fatigue with exercise (Uhthoff's phenomenon), makes #multiple sclerosis# (MS) a likely diagnosis.  MS is an immune-mediated disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), characterized by focal lesions of demyelination.  Patients have various neurologic deficits that wax and wane (symptoms are disseminated across time and space). $Histologically, active MS plaques are characterized by #perivenular inflammatory infiltrates# made up primarily of autoreactive T lymphocytes and macrophages directed against myelin components.  Extensive inflammation damages the blood-brain barrier, increasing inflammatory cell recruitment into the CNS (with the vessel wall remaining intact, unlike in CNS vasculitis).  Infiltrating #macrophages containing myelin debris# are seen throughout the lesion, and recruitment of B lymphocytes to the perivascular spaces leads to the formation of myelin-specific antibodies.  #Patchy demyelination# occurs, and while axons are typically spared, significant or prolonged disease may result in neuron death.  Residual chronic findings include hypertrophy and hyperplasia of astrocytes (glial scarring). $#(Choice A)#  Microglial nodules are nonspecific findings that can be seen in patients with MS, as well as in those with HIV encephalopathy and other viral infections.  They are thought to be reactive lesions that occur in the setting of inflammation, rather than a specific pathologic finding. $#(Choice B)#  Neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (@tau protein@) are characteristic findings in Alzheimer disease, which presents with memory impairment, not focal neurologic deficits, and is rare in young patients. $#(Choice D)#  Spongiform encephalopathy is seen in prion diseases (eg, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease).  Patients present with rapid-onset dementia, myoclonus, and ataxia.  Episodic or waxing and waning symptoms are more consistent with MS. $#(Choice E)#  Negri bodies are viral inclusions in the cytoplasm of nerve cells in patients with rabies.  Rabies occurs after a bite from an infected animal and presents with tingling or irritation at the inoculation site followed by hydrophobia, delirium, coma, and death.  This disease is typically fatal within days of symptom presentation and would not be expected to cause focal abnormalities over a period of months. $#Educational objective# Multiple sclerosis is an immune-mediated disorder of the central nervous system characterized by focal demyelination (plaques).

However, they are #unaware#, as indicated by non-responsiveness to external stimuli, absence of language comprehension or expression, and lack of purposeful visual tracking.  Brainstem reflexes (eg, cough, gag, pupillary constriction) are usually intact.  Because voluntary sphincter control is lost in PVS, patients have urinary and fecal incontinence.  Similarly, control of swallowing (a complex voluntary process) is lost, so patients with PVS require enteral (eg, gastrostomy) tube feedings. $#(Choice B)#  Cataplexy is an abrupt, massive inhibition of muscle tone typically triggered by strong emotions (laughter, fright) in patients with narcolepsy.  Patients suddenly go limp and collapse, but they usually recover after a few seconds. $#(Choice C)#  Locked-in syndrome can occur due to osmotic demyelination (eg, excessively rapid hyponatremia correction) or infarction (eg, basilar artery stroke) of pontine corticospinal neurons.  As opposed to being unaware and mobile (like this patient), locked-in patients are aware but completely paralyzed except for blinking and vertical eye movement. $#(Choice E)#  Selective mutism is a form of social anxiety disorder in which patients do not verbalize despite negative interpersonal consequences.

Cysts and other anomalies are noted in different organs.  Intracranial berry aneurysms arise in the circle of Willis, and when these aneurysms rupture they cause subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).  The clinical presentation described in this question is suggestive of SAH.  Patients complain of a severe headache ('the worst headache of their life'); neck stiffness is usually present or develops in the next 24 hours as blood in the subarachnoid space acts as a meningeal irritant.  Papilledema and pupillary dilation may be noted, but there are no focal neurologic findings. $CT scan of the brain without contrast is the most commonly used initial imaging study for diagnosing SAH and should be done during the first 24 hours from the onset of symptoms.  This is positive in up to 90% of patients.  If the CT scan does not show SAH, but the clinical suspicion remains high, a lumbar puncture needs to be performed to evaluate the cerebrospinal fluid for the presence of xanthochromia (blood in the CSF).  Thus, presence of the xanthochromia in a clinical scenario suggestive of SAH is the most sensitive test for diagnosing SAH. $#(Choice A)#  The classic presentation of meningitis includes fever, headache, neck stiffness, photophobia, nausea, vomiting, and signs of cerebral dysfunction (eg, lethargy, confusion, and coma).  Additionally, remember to look for clues leading you to the correct answer.  For example, the question writer here mentioned that this patient has ADPKD for a reason, to lead you to SAH. $#(Choice B)#  Migraine headache is throbbing or pulsatile.  It is initially unilateral and localized in the frontotemporal and ocular area, then progresses posteriorly and becomes diffuse.  It typically lasts from several hours to an entire day. $#(Choice C)#  Intracerebral hemorrhage manifests with headache, vomiting and sudden onset of focal neurological deficits (hemiplegia, hemianesthesia, cranial nerve deficits, aphasia etc).  Focal neurologic manifestations are unusual with SAH. $#(Choice E)# An elderly male with scalp tenderness over the temporal area (or headache), blurred vision and intermittent claudication of jaw is a typical presentation of temporal arteritis.  This condition is also accompanied by a very high ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and many times occurs in the setting of polymyalgia rheumatica.  Rapid treatment with corticosteroids is necessary to prevent potential blindness. $#(Choice F)#  Cluster headache consists of recurrent brief attacks of sudden, severe, unilateral periorbital pain associated with ipsilateral rhinorrhea, and watering of the eyes. $#Educational objective# Intracranial berry aneurysms of the circle of Willis are often seen in patients with ADPKD; when ruptured, they cause subarachnoid hemorrhage that presents with sudden onset of \"thunderclap headache\".

The @mutant mRNA@ is untranslatable and #toxic# to the expression of other genes, particularly those related to skeletal muscle chloride channels, resulting in #myotonia#.  Grip myotonia is classic and characterized by impaired muscle relaxation after voluntary release of a contracted hand. $The toxic mRNA also affects @T tubules@, which usually facilitate synchronized release of calcium ions for organized muscle contraction, resulting in weakness due to impaired excitation-contraction coupling.  #Weakness# classically involves the #face# (eg, long, narrow face with sagging) and #distal skeletal muscles#.  This patient's recent falls are likely due to footdrop, but quadriceps involvement can occasionally occur and may be contributing to his difficulty walking up stairs.  Muscular atrophy in DM preferentially affects the #type I (slow-twitch) fibers#, as seen on this patient's muscle biopsy. $Other common features of DM include cataracts, insulin resistance, and #early-onset frontal balding#. $#(Choice A)#  Inflammatory myopathies (eg, dermatomyositis, polymyositis) present with symmetric proximal muscle weakness without myotonia.  In addition, inflammatory cell infiltration is seen on muscle biopsy. $#(Choice B)#  Certain ion channel myopathies can manifest with myotonia, but those that do so are associated with muscle hypertrophy (not atrophy) due to muscle overactivity.  In contrast, the genetic defects causing muscular dystrophy result in progressive muscle damage that leads to atrophy of muscle fibers. $#(Choice C)#  Mitochondrial myopathies are characterized by varying degrees of muscle weakness, typically presenting in infancy or early childhood with multisystem involvement (eg, seizures).  In addition, ragged red fibers (due to bright red mitochondrial bundles) are classically seen on muscle biopsy. $#(Choice D)#  Motor neuron disease (eg, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) is characterized by progressive nerve degeneration, resulting in skeletal muscle weakness.  Muscle wasting and a weak grip are common, but impaired muscle relaxation does not occur. $#(Choice F)#  Myasthenia gravis, caused by postsynaptic acetylcholine receptor antibodies, is the most common neuromuscular junction disorder and presents with proximal muscle weakness.  However, the weakness is fluctuating and fatigable, and hand weakness and relaxation impairment would not be expected. $#Educational objective# Myotonic dystrophy is characterized by muscle weakness and myotonia (impaired muscle relaxation) with muscle atrophy, particularly of the type I (slow-twitch) muscle fibers.

CP is a nonprogressive neurologic injury that causes motor dysfunction.  #Spastic# CP is the most common subtype and can affect the bilateral lower extremities (diplegia), unilateral arm and leg (#hemiplegia#), or in more severe cases, all four extremities (quadriplegia). $CP is more common in #premature# and low birthweight infants because they are susceptible to white matter loss (ie, @periventricular leukomalacia@) around the lateral ventricles.  In contrast to term infants, in whom watershed injury of the cerebral cortex is more likely to occur with poor perfusion, premature infants have sparse vascularization of the periventricular cerebral white matter.  Ischemia to this area disrupts normal myelination, leading to neuronal cell death and #cystic necrosis#.  In addition, prematurity is also associated with increased risk for intraventricular hemorrhage, which can further contribute to the development of CP.

It may be idiopathic or occur secondary to prior brain trauma (as in this patient), infection, or subarachnoid hemorrhage, resulting in scarring of the arachnoid granulations.  As CSF accumulates, the ventricles progressively expand to accommodate the increasing volume, thereby maintaining normal intracranial pressure. $Symptoms of NPH are progressive and occur due to the disruption of periventricular white matter tracts by the expanding ventricles.

  "explanation_2": "During laparoscopic procedures, small incisions are created to insert instruments into the abdominal cavity.  Gas is insufflated to allow better visualization and easier access to organs while operating.  Difficulty maintaining abdominal insufflation due to muscle contraction is often caused by insufficient doses of paralytic agents.  However, if the patient has been appropriately medicated, sustained muscle contraction, especially when widespread, may be due to #malignant hyperthermia# (MH). $MH is often due to abnormal ryanodine receptors (RYR1) in the skeletal muscle.  On exposure to certain anesthetic agents (typically succinylcholine and inhalational gases), these abnormal receptors allow the unregulated passage of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the intracellular space.  As a result of excessive calcium accumulation, patients develop sudden-onset, #widespread muscle rigidity#.  Sustained muscle contraction #produces excessive CO2#, leading to hypercarbia and acidosis; depletes cellular oxygen, leading to lactic acid production; and causes #muscle breakdown#, leading to rhabdomyolysis.  #Hyperthermia# is often a later clinical sign that develops as the increased cellular metabolism overwhelms the body's ability to dissipate heat. $Many pharmacologic muscle relaxants work upstream from the pathologic process of excessive calcium release and are therefore ineffective during an acute MH crisis.  #Dantrolene# is used to treat MH because it directly #inhibits intracellular calcium release# from the abnormal ryanodine receptor (RYR1). $#(Choice A)#  Neostigmine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that prevents the degradation of acetylcholine in the neuromuscular junction.  Therefore, it could increase, rather than decrease, the strength of muscle contractions. $#(Choice B)#  Alpha-adrenergic antagonists (eg, phentolamine, phenoxybenzamine) inhibit alpha-receptor–mediated sympathetic activity.  They are used primarily to lower blood pressure by decreasing vascular tone; they have minimal effect on skeletal muscle. $#(Choices C and D)#  Baclofen is a GABA-B agonist that increases neuron hyperpolarization in the CNS to relax muscles.  Nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (eg, rocuronium) are nicotinic receptor antagonists that inhibit the action of acetylcholine at the motor endplate.  Both agents work upstream from intracellular calcium release and therefore have minimal impact on muscle contraction during an MH crisis. $#Educational objective# Malignant hyperthermia presents with widespread muscle rigidity after administration of inhalation anesthetics and/or succinylcholine to genetically susceptible individuals.  It is treated with dantrolene, which blocks ryanodine receptors to prevent the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytoplasm of skeletal muscle fibers.  "

As a result, saturation of the blood requires further absorption of anesthetic in order to replace that which is absorbed by the peripheral tissues.  Because blood saturation takes longer, brain saturation is also delayed and onset of action is slower. $In contrast, anesthetic gases with low peripheral tissue solubility have smaller arteriovenous gradients as there is less peripheral tissue uptake #(choices B and C)#.  Less anesthetic is required to replace the amount absorbed by the peripheral tissue and so blood saturation occurs quickly, allowing concentrations in the brain to equilibrate faster #(choice A).# $#(Choice D)#  Potency of the anesthetic is defined by the minimal alveolar concentration (MAC), the alveolar concentration that prevents movement in 50% of patients exposed to noxious stimuli.

  "explanation_2": "The potency of an inhaled anesthetic is determined by the minimum concentration in the brain necessary to achieve an adequate level of anesthesia.  When an inhaled anesthetic is administered at a constant rate over a prolonged period of time, its partial pressure in the brain equals its partial pressure in the other compartments (inhaled air, lungs, and arterial blood).  Since an anesthetic's concentration in the brain tissue is directly proportional to its partial pressure, it is possible to use the steady-state alveolar partial pressure of the inhaled agent as a measure of anesthetic potency. $The minimal alveolar concentration (MAC) refers to the percentage of anesthetic in the inspired gas mixture that renders 50% of patients unresponsive to painful stimuli.  It corresponds to ED₅₀ on the dose-effect curve.  Potency is inversely proportional to the MAC: the lower the MAC, the more potent the anesthetic.  MAC is an intrinsic property of the anesthetic that does not depend on the type of surgery; duration of anesthesia; or the sex, height, and weight of the patient.  It does, however, depend on body temperature and also decreases with increasing patient age. $#(Choice A)#  The arteriovenous concentration gradient is an indirect measurement of the solubility of the anesthetic in body tissues.  A high arteriovenous concentration gradient means that more anesthetic is extracted from the blood by the body tissues, increasing the time it takes for the blood to become saturated and slowing the onset of action. $#(Choice B)#  The blood/gas partition coefficient corresponds to the solubility of anesthetic in the blood.  Anesthetics with a high blood/gas partition coefficient are absorbed to a greater extent by the blood and have a slower onset of action. $#(Choice C)#  Clearance of inhaled anesthetics occurs mainly via exhalation from the lungs into the air; hepatic metabolism of most gas anesthetics is low.  However, certain gas anesthetics, particularly halothane, are metabolized extensively by the liver, resulting in the production of reactive intermediates that cause hepatotoxicity. $#(Choice E)#  The steepness of the arterial tension curve depends on the solubility of the anesthetic in the blood.  Partial pressure in the blood rises more rapidly with less soluble anesthetics, producing a steeper curve. $#Educational objective# The minimal alveolar concentration (MAC) is a measure of potency of an inhaled anesthetic.

Direct dopamine replacement is impossible because dopamine cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, so #levodopa# (ie, L-DOPA), the immediate #precursor of dopamine#, is used.  Once levodopa crosses the BBB, it is taken up by nigrostriatal neurons and converted to therapeutic dopamine in the brain. $Levodopa is rapidly metabolized in the peripheral tissues to dopamine (via aromatic D-amino acid [DOPA] decarboxylase) and 3-O-methyldopa (via #catechol O-methyltransferase [COMT]#).  Therefore, only a small percentage of levodopa reaches the brain.  Both COMT inhibitors (eg, #entacapone#, tolcapone) and DOPA decarboxylase inhibitors (eg, carbidopa) #decrease peripheral levodopa degradation# and increase the amount of levodopa available to cross the blood-brain barrier. $Patients are nearly always prescribed carbidopa with levodopa.  The progression of Parkinson disease leads to an increasingly @narrow therapeutic window@, as seen in this patient with bothersome \"#wearing off#\" periods.

It is also thought to cause anticholinergic effects (reduces tremor), as well as antagonism of N-methyl D-aspartate receptors (reduces glutamine-induced neurotoxicity). $#(Choices D and E)#  The dopamine insufficiency of Parkinson disease upsets the normal balance between dopamine and acetylcholine in the basal ganglia, resulting in cholinergic hypersensitivity.  Anticholinergic medications (eg, trihexyphenidyl) counteract this effect by inhibiting central muscarinic receptors.  Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (eg, donepezil, rivastigmine) would increase the amount of acetylcholine in the CNS, which could worsen symptoms of Parkinson disease. $#Educational objective# Parkinson disease is typically treated with levodopa (immediate precursor of dopamine), which crosses the blood-brain barrier.  Levodopa is administered with DOPA decarboxylase inhibitors (eg, carbidopa) and sometimes catechol O-methyltransferase inhibitors (eg, entacapone) to reduce the peripheral metabolism of levodopa, resulting in increased levodopa bioavailability within the brain.

  "explanation_2": "$This novel medication that induces hypokalemia while reducing uterine contractions during pregnancy is most likely a #beta-2# adrenergic receptor #agonist#.  Beta-2 receptors are ubiquitously expressed throughout the body, with the lungs and vasculature having the greatest tissue density.  Receptor activation results in #bronchodilation# and #vasodilation# due to smooth muscle relaxation; in addition, beta-2 stimulation can also modulate key functions of other organs (eg, eye, uterus). $Once a fetus grows to a sufficiently large size, myometrial distension signals the maternal hypothalamus to produce and release oxytocin into the bloodstream.  Oxytocin then binds to receptors located on the myometrium, leading to opening of membrane-bound calcium channels and muscular contraction.  In addition, oxytocin binding stimulates the production of prostaglandins (PGE1, PGE2, PGF2α) that also induce contraction #(choice E).#  If contractions begin too early (ie, preterm labor), pregnancy may be prolonged by using inhibitors of uterine contraction (@tocolytics@).  Stimulation of myometrial beta-2 receptors decreases intracellular calcium within myometrial cells, #impairing uterine contraction#. $Beta-2 receptors also regulate activity of the sodium-potassium pump located on all cells.  This pump maintains the resting membrane potential by driving sodium extracellularly and potassium intracellularly.  Overstimulation of beta-2 receptors can lead to significant potassium internalization, resulting in #hypokalemia#. $#(Choices B and D)#  Magnesium sulfate and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) competitively block membrane calcium channels, preventing the influx of calcium needed to stimulate contraction.  Magnesium inhibits renal outer medullary potassium excretion channels in the kidneys, leading to hyperkalemia.  CCBs alone do not alter potassium levels. $#(Choice C)#  Methylergonovine, an ergot alkaloid, is used to increase uterine contractions (uterotonic) through its activity on the 5-HT2A receptor.  It can be used to treat postpartum hemorrhage by stimulating the myometrium to clamp down on uterine vessels. $#Educational objective# Although beta-2 receptors are predominant in the lungs and vasculature, they are also found on all cell membranes, including those of the uterus.  Stimulation of uterine receptors results in smooth muscle relaxation (tocolysis), while stimulation of sodium-potassium ATPase pumps can result in hypokalemia.  ",

Morphine and other commonly used opiates have an especially high affinity for the #mu receptor#, which exerts the strongest analgesic effects. $In the spine, opiates bind to mu receptors on the primary afferent neuron, resulting in closure of voltage-gated calcium channels, #reduced calcium influx#, and decreased excitatory neurotransmitter release (eg, acetylcholine, norepinephrine, serotonin, glutamate, substance P) from the #presynaptic terminal (choice C).#  Opiates also bind to mu receptors on the #postsynaptic membrane#, which opens potassium channels and leads to membrane hyperpolarization due to #potassium efflux#.

Chlorpheniramine is a first-generation antihistamine that acts by blocking both central and peripheral H1 receptors.  Chlorpheniramine and other #first-generation antihistamines# can be very sedating because they easily penetrate the #blood-brain barrier# and accumulate in the CNS.  The most sedating of this generation of antihistamines are diphenhydramine, promethazine, and hydroxyzine.  Despite the associated sedation, these antihistamines are often still used to prevent/treat allergic reactions and motion sickness and as antiemetics. $#(Choice B)#  Loratadine is a second-generation antihistamine that blocks peripheral H1 histamine receptors.  It does not enter the CNS and does not cause drowsiness. $#(Choice C)#  In patients with significant liver disease (eg, cirrhosis), caution should be used when prescribing acetaminophen and diazepam because both are hepatically metabolized.  Otherwise, acetaminophen does not cause sedation and can generally be taken safely with diazepam.  Diazepam may speed up acetaminophen metabolism (thereby decreasing acetaminophen levels), but this interaction is very minor. $#(Choice D)#  Famotidine is a H2 receptor antagonist that inhibits gastric acid secretion.  It is metabolized by the CYP450 system but has minimial effects on the metabolism of other drugs. $#(Choice E)#  Lansoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that decreases gastric acid secretion.  Although both diazepam and lansoprazole are metabolized by the P450 system, studies have shown that lansoprazole does not have clinically significant interactions with diazepam. $#Educational objective# First-generation H1-histamine receptor antagonists, including diphenhydramine and chlorpheniramine, can cause significant sedation, especially when used with other medications that cause CNS depression (such as benzodiazepines).

  "explanation_2": "This patient has developed symptoms of intermittent asthma (eg, cough, wheeze, dyspnea) associated with a new medication for his #essential tremor# (ET).  ET is a common movement disorder, and beta blockers are often used as first-line therapy for debilitating or distressful symptoms.  Beta blockers prevent the interaction of epinephrine and norepinephrine with receptors at adrenergic synapses; in ET, this is thought to help dampen the sensitivity of muscle spindles, which improves tremor symptoms by smoothing out the force of contraction. $Propranolol, the most commonly used medication for treatment of ET, is a #nonselective beta blocker# (ie, inhibits both beta-1 and beta-2 receptors).  In patients with reactive airway diseases (eg, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), #inhibition of beta-2 receptors# can cause #bronchoconstriction# with resultant asthma symptoms.  Selective beta-1 blockers are often better tolerated in patients with asthma; however, selectivity is dose-dependent and patients can develop bronchoconstriction at high doses. $#(Choice A)#  Tyrosine is transported into the cell by the large neutral amino acid transporter. $#(Choice B)#  The conversion of tyrosine to dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) by tyrosine hydroxylase is the rate-limiting step in catecholamine biosynthesis.  This enzyme was previously inhibited by drugs used to treat pheochromocytoma, but these are no longer used due to a poor side effect profile. $#(Choice C)#  The medication reserpine inhibits vesicular monoamine transporter, thereby inhibiting dopamine entry into presynaptic vesicles and essentially causing a chemical sympathectomy.  Reserpine is occasionally used as an antipsychotic.  It may cause wheezing in some patients but is not indicated in the treatment of ET. $#(Choice D)#  Adrenergic neuron blockers such as guanethidine inhibit norepinephrine release, lowering blood pressure and heart rate.  Guanethidine is occasionally used for chronic pain syndrome but does not cause bronchoconstriction; it is not used in management of ET. $#(Choice E)#  Tricyclic antidepressants and cocaine work by inhibiting norepinephrine reuptake by presynaptic neurons.  These agents can worsen symptoms in ET. $#Educational objective# Beta blockers are used in the treatment of essential tremor.  Propranolol, a nonselective beta blocker, is the most commonly used therapy and prevents the interaction of epinephrine and norepinephrine with beta-1 and beta-2 receptors to relieve tremor symptoms.  However, inhibition of pulmonary beta-2 receptors in patients with underlying reactive airway disease can cause bronchoconstriction, leading to cough, wheeze, and dyspnea.  "

  "explanation_2": "This patient with vague lower extremity discomfort and an urge to move the legs that worsens at night has typical features of #restless legs syndrome# (RLS).  RLS is characterized by uncomfortable sensations in the legs that are often difficult to describe and associated with an urge to move the lower extremities.  Symptoms are #relieved with movement# (eg, walking, stretching) and are #typically worse at night#.  As a result, patients often develop sleep-onset insomnia. $The pathophysiology of RLS is incompletely understood but likely involves CNS #iron deficiency# (even in patients with normal serum iron levels) and #abnormalities in dopaminergic transmission#.  Certain medications, including dopamine antagonists (eg, antipsychotics, certain antiemetics [metoclopramide]), first-generation antihistamines (eg, diphenhydramine), and antidepressants (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [eg, sertraline], mirtazapine), are associated with worsening symptoms #(choice E).# $Treatment includes lifestyle measures (eg, limiting alcohol and caffeine) and #alpha-2-delta calcium channel ligands# (eg, #gabapentin#, pregabalin).  Dopamine agonists (eg, pramipexole) are alternate agents, but regular use can lead to augmentation of symptoms (ie, paradoxical worsening with chronic therapy) as well as the risk of impulse control disorders. $#(Choice A)#  Muscarinic receptor antagonists (eg, benztropine) have been used for the treatment of dystonia, which is characterized by sustained muscle contractions usually associated with abnormal posturing (eg, torticollis). $#(Choice C)#  Opioid mu-receptor agonists (eg, oxycodone) are occasionally used for refractory RLS but carry significant risks (eg, sedation, abuse, respiratory depression).  Opioid antagonists (eg, naltrexone) are not useful. $#(Choice D)#  Beta-adrenergic antagonists (eg, propranolol) are used for treating akathisia (ie, a strong urge to move), which occurs most commonly as an adverse effect of dopamine antagonists (eg, antipsychotic drugs).  Although akathisia is similar to RLS, it is not accompanied by an unpleasant sensation in the legs and does not follow a circadian rhythm. $#Educational objective# Restless legs syndrome is characterized by an uncomfortable sensation in the legs accompanied by an urge to move them; symptoms worsen with inactivity and at night and are temporarily relieved with movement.

In patients with a recent SAH, nitrates should be avoided because they can increase cerebral blood flow and intracranial pressure, which can worsen bleeding. $#(Choice F)#  Osmotic diuretics (eg, mannitol) are part of the treatment for increased intracranial pressure (ICP).  Although hydrocephalus can be a complication of SAH and result in elevated ICP, it typically presents with a gradual change in level of consciousness accompanied by ocular changes (eg, downward eye deviation, miosis) rather than focal extremity deficits.  Ventricular dilation on neuroimaging is diagnostic. $#(Choice G)#  Thiazide diuretics are a first-line therapy for essential hypertension in the outpatient setting.  They are not indicated for use in preventing complications due to cerebral vasospasm following SAH. $#Educational objective# Delayed cerebral ischemia due to cerebral vasospasm usually presents 3-12 days after the initial subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) with an acute change in mental status and/or new focal neurological deficits.  Nimodipine, a selective calcium channel blocker, improves outcomes in patients with cerebral vasospasm by inducing cerebral vasodilation and decreasing calcium-dependent excitotoxicity.  "

However, syncope may be a warning sign of a serious underlying pathology (eg, cardiac arrhythmia, severe aortic stenosis, pulmonary embolism).  In addition, numerous #medications# can cause or contribute to syncope and should be considered. $#Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors# (eg, donepezil, rivastigmine) are commonly used in the management of Alzheimer dementia.  Alzheimer dementia involves dysfunction of cholinergic pathways in the brain; therefore, inhibition of acetylcholinesterase and a consequent reduction in acetylcholine breakdown may improve cognitive function in some patients.  However, this mechanism also produces #enhanced parasympathetic tone# that can lead to adverse effects.  Underlying age-related degeneration of the conduction system is common in the elderly, and the effects of acetylcholinesterase inhibition can precipitate #bradycardia# and #atrioventricular block# in such patients.

Terazosin (used for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia) and first-generation histamine-1 blockers (eg, diphenhydramine) have alpha-1 receptor-blocking properties and may also contribute to orthostatic syncope via inhibited vasoconstriction.  Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (eg, canagliflozin) may contribute to orthostatic syncope by stimulating an osmotic diuresis that leads to hypovolemia.  None of these agents cause syncope via the slowing of cardiac conduction and they would not explain this patient's episodic bradycardia and atrioventricular block. $#Educational objective# Syncope results from a transient loss of cerebral perfusion, and numerous medications can cause or contribute to syncope.

  "explanation_2": "Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular-blocking agent that, like acetylcholine, attaches to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and depolarizes the neuromuscular end plate.  Unlike acetylcholine, succinylcholine is not degraded by acetylcholinesterase, resulting in continuous stimulation of the endplate (reflected by initial transient fasciculations).  However, the sodium channels surrounding the end plate rapidly become inactivated and cannot reopen until the end plate is repolarized.  Thus, succinylcholine-induced depolarization remains isolated to the end plate, resulting in development of a flaccid paralysis (#phase 1 block#).  Eventually, with continued administration of succinylcholine, the continuous depolarization of the endplate gives way to gradual repolarization as the nAChR becomes desensitized to the effects of succinylcholine.  This is termed #phase II block# and is similar to non-depolarizing blockade. $Because the nAChR is a nonselective cation channel, its opening not only allows sodium influx but also potassium release.  Exaggerated hyperkalemia and life-threatening arrhythmias can occur in patients with crush or burn injuries, denervating injuries or diseases (eg, quadriplegia and Guillain-Barré syndrome), and myopathies.  These pathologic states cause up-regulation of muscle nAChRs and/or rhabdomyolysis, which can result in the release of large amounts of potassium when succinylcholine is administered.  In these patients, non-depolarizing agents such as vecuronium or rocuronium are better choices #(choice E)#. $#(Choice A)#  The nondepolarizing neuromuscular-blocking agent atracurium releases histamine and can produce a fall in blood pressure, flushing, and bronchoconstriction.

The mechanism of this side effect is associated with increased expression of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF).  When gingival macrophages are exposed to increased amounts of PDGF, they stimulate proliferation of gingival cells and alveolar bone.  Gingival hyperplasia may regress after discontinuation of phenytoin. $Phenytoin is an anticonvulsant effective in the treatment of grand mal (tonic-clonic) seizures, partial seizures, and status epilepticus.  Phenytoin inhibits abnormal electrical activity of the brain by blocking voltage-gated sodium channels in neurons.  Phenytoin has a narrow therapeutic index with a number of potential adverse effects:  $1. Phenytoin toxicity is mainly characterized by CNS manifestations.  Its effect on the cerebellum and vestibular system can cause ataxia and nystagmus.  $2. Long-term therapy with phenytoin may cause gingival hyperplasia, coarsening of the facial features, and hirsutism.  $3. Phenytoin interferes with the metabolism of folic acid and may cause megaloblastic anemia.  $4. Phenytoin induces the P450 cytochrome oxidase system.  It increases the metabolism—and therefore decreases the blood level—of many medications.  $5. If taken during pregnancy, phenytoin may cause fetal hydantoin syndrome. $#(Choice B)# Lithium also has a narrow therapeutic index.  Lithium toxicity is associated with neuromuscular excitability (irregular coarse tremors, fascicular twitching, rigid motor agitation, and ataxia).  It may also cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, hypothyroidism, and cardiac conduction defects, but not gingival hyperplasia. $#(Choice C)# The adverse effects of prednisone include hyperglycemia, weight gain, depression, fluid retention with edema, and osteoporosis. $#(Choice D)# Cocaine blocks the re-uptake of norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine in the CNS.  It can cause cardiac ischemia, hypertension, and seizures.  Cocaine withdrawal is associated with severe depression. $#(Choice E)# Methimazole inhibits thyroid hormone synthesis by suppressing the iodination and coupling of tyrosine.  Side effects include edema, rash, and agranulocytosis. $#(Choice F)# Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic that is most helpful in treating the negative symptoms of schizophrenia.  The most serious side effects of clozapine include agranulocytosis and seizures. $#Educational objective# Gingival hyperplasia is a common side effect of phenytoin and is sometimes reversible when phenytoin is withdrawn.  Phenytoin causes increased expression of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF).  When gingival macrophages are exposed to increased amounts of PDGF, they stimulate proliferation of gingival cells and alveolar bone.  Phenytoin toxicity mainly affects the cerebellum and vestibular system, causing ataxia and nystagmus.  "

  "explanation_2": "Cell membrane receptors can be divided into two broad categories: ionotropic receptors  (ion channels that open directly upon ligand binding) and metabotropic receptors (these receptors utilize second messengers to indirectly influence their corresponding ion channels).  Nicotinic cholinergic receptors of the neuromuscular junction are an example of a ligand-gated ion channel receptor (ionotropic receptor).  As an action potential progresses to the presynaptic terminal, voltage-gated calcium channels open and allow entry of calcium into the nerve cytoplasm.  This triggers the fusion of storage vesicles with the membrane, allowing a release of acetylcholine (ACh).  This ACh diffuses across the synaptic cleft and ultimately interacts with nicotinic cholinergic receptors present on the motor end-plate.  These receptors are ion channels that are comprised of five subunits with two ACh binding sites.  If, and only if, both binding sites are filled, the ion channel will open.  There is subsequent sodium and calcium #influx# and potassium #outflux# that results in the generation of an end-plate potential. $Nicotinic cholinergic receptors are also found in the CNS and on postganglionic neurons of autonomic ganglia.  The description in the question stem most likely represents a nicotinic cholinergic receptor given the #immediate# flux of sodium, calcium, and potassium demonstrated by the scientists. $#(Choice A)#  Binding of epinephrine to α1 adrenoceptors results in the activation of the inositol triphosphate (IP3) pathway.  This pathway results in increased intracellular calcium via release of Ca2+ from storage organelles. $#(Choices B & C)#  β1 and β2 adrenoceptors are associated with the cAMP signal transduction pathway.  Stimulation of  these receptors causes protein kinase A activation. $#(Choice D)#  M1 and M3 muscarinic receptors utilize the inositol triphosphate pathway to increase intracellular calcium concentration and activate protein kinase C.  M2 muscarinic receptors act via the cAMP second messenger system, and when activated decrease intracellular cAMP concentrations. $#Educational objective# The autonomic nervous system utilizes three types of signal pathways: cAMP, IP3, and ion channels.  Nicotinic receptors are ligand-gated ion channels that open after binding acetylcholine.  This results in an immediate influx of Na+ and Ca2+ into the cell and an outflux of K+ from the cell.  "

  "explanation_1": "During anesthetic induction with a gaseous agent, the partial pressure of the anesthetic rises in the blood until it reaches its partial pressure in the inspired gas.  At this point, no more of the anesthetic can dissolve in the blood and the blood is said to be saturated with the anesthetic.  The speed at which the blood becomes saturated depends on the solubility of the gas in the blood.  Highly soluble anesthetics dissolve easily in the blood, and thus larger amounts must be absorbed before the blood becomes saturated. $Blood solubility of an anesthetic is indicated by its #blood/gas partition coefficient# - anesthetics with higher blood solubility have larger blood/gas partition coefficients.  Nitrous oxide (N2O) is an example of a poorly soluble gas with a blood/gas partition coefficient of 0.47.  In the graph above, the partial pressure of N2O in blood rises rapidly and plateaus, indicating that the blood quickly becomes saturated with the anesthetic.  In contrast, drug A has higher solubility (ie, a larger blood/gas partition coefficient) as its partial pressure in the blood rises more slowly.  The curve for drug A eventually levels out at the same partial pressure as N2O since the drugs are inspired at equal partial pressures.  However, by this point, far more drug A is dissolved in the blood. $The speed of anesthetic induction is determined by the rate at which the brain tissues take up the agent, which is dependent on the solubility of the anesthetic in the blood.  If an agent has poor blood solubility, the amount of gas needed to saturate the blood is small and brain saturation occurs fairly quickly.  Conversely, highly soluble anesthetics are absorbed to a greater degree by the blood, delaying saturation of the central nervous system.  ",

  "explanation_2": "$#Migraines# are recurrent, debilitating, unilateral headaches with a pulsating or throbbing quality lasting between 4-72 hours, often with photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea.  They can be associated with an aura and are more common in younger women. $Although the pathogenesis of migraines is multifactorial and not fully understood, it is associated with cortical spreading depression (ie, self-propagating neurotransmission across the cortex).  Subsequent stimulation of #trigeminal afferents# in the meninges causes the release of #vasoactive neuropeptides#, including substance P and #calcitonin gene–related peptide# (CGRP), leading to neurogenic inflammation, vasodilation, and plasma protein extravasation.  These substances may also contribute to the increased sensitivity of nociceptive pathways to stimuli (ie, neuronal sensitization). $#Triptans# (eg, sumatriptan) are serotonin #5#-#hydroxytryptamine 1B/1D# #agonists# that directly counter migraine headaches by binding to trigeminal serotonin receptors and #inhibiting CGRP# release from the trigeminal neurons.  In addition, triptans bind serotonin receptors on the smooth muscle cells of blood vessels, resulting in intracranial vasoconstriction.

  "explanation_2": "As with many other medications, phenytoin is metabolized by hepatic P450 oxidase.  Plasma drug level, efficacy, and the severity of side effects are directly influenced by the rate of #metabolism of phenytoin#.  The following features of phenytoin metabolism are important: $• Hepatic hydroxylation of phenytoin is #dose-dependent#.  When low doses of phenytoin are administered, a large number of free enzyme molecules are available to rapidly bind and eliminate the drug.  Higher doses of phenytoin cause the enzymes to be fully saturated; increasing the dose above the saturation limit prolongs drug metabolism (switches from first- to zero-order kinetics) and leads to a rapid rise in plasma levels. $• Phenytoin is an #inducer of P450 oxidase#.  P450 inducers can increase the rate of elimination of medications that are metabolized by the liver, such as oral contraceptives, thereby reducing efficacy. $• Because phenytoin itself is metabolized by P450 enzymes, its level is affected when it is co-administered with other medications that induce or inhibit the P450 system.  The co-administration of phenytoin with P450 inducers (eg, #rifampin#, carbamazepine) decreases concentration of phenytoin in plasma and diminishes its effectiveness. $#(Choice A)#  Amoxicillin does not affect the hepatic metabolism of phenytoin. $#(Choices C, D and E)#  Fluconazole, cimetidine, and omeprazole inhibit P450 enzymes and increase the concentration of phenytoin in the serum. $#(Choice F)#  Oral contraceptives are metabolized by hepatic P450 oxidase, but neither induce nor inhibit the activity of P450 oxidase. $#Educational objective# Phenytoin metabolism depends on the function of hepatic P450 oxidases and is dose-dependent.  Drugs that induce hepatic microsomal enzymes (phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and rifampin) enhance phenytoin metabolism and decrease its serum concentration.  "

MRI of the head reveals only #diffuse cortical atrophy# and no evidence of structural disease (eg, hydrocephalus, chronic subdural hematoma, vascular infarction).  Therefore, she is most likely suffering from #Alzheimer disease# (AD), the most common form of primary dementia. $The pathogenesis of AD is complex but culminates in diffuse atrophy of cortical neurons.  Specifically, #degeneration of cholinergic neurons# in the basal forebrain contributes to memory loss and functional decline.  These cholinergic neurons project throughout the neocortex to positively regulate areas involved in memory (hippocampal formations) and executive function (frontal cortex), which are impaired in AD.  Cholinesterase inhibitors (eg, donepezil, galantamine) block acetylcholinesterase in the synaptic cleft to compensate for the loss of cholinergic transmission. $#Cholinesterase inhibitors# have modest effects on memory and cognition to #improve daily functioning#.  Cholinergic therapy should be considered in most patients with AD.  Conversely, anticholinergic medications (eg, tricyclic antidepressants) should be discontinued whenever feasible because they can exacerbate cognitive dysfunction. $Although they improve symptoms, procholinergic agents do not enhance neuron survival, so they have little impact on the overall trajectory of AD.  In contrast, NMDA receptor antagonists (eg, memantine) inhibit glutamate NMDA signaling #(choice C)# to prevent excitotoxicity (calcium overload) and subsequent neuronal apoptosis.  These agents likely serve a neuroprotective role, slowing disease progression. $#(Choice A)#  Norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors (eg, methylphenidate, atomoxetine) are central stimulants.  They can promote wakefulness to treat narcolepsy or enhance concentration to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. $#(Choice D)#  Dopamine precursors (eg, levodopa) can enhance dopamine availability in Parkinson disease (PD), which can be associated with dementia in later stages.  They are used to improve motor rigidity but have no role in PD-related cognitive decline. $#(Choice E)#  Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI; eg, citalopram) are first-line medications for major depressive disorder, which may mimic dementia (ie, pseudodementia).  SSRIs are also used to manage the depressive mood symptoms related to AD.  They do not address the underlying cognitive impairment due to neuron cell death and loss of cholinergic signaling. $#Educational objective# Alzheimer disease (AD) is a progressive dementia featuring diffuse cortical atrophy involving loss of cholinergic neurons.  Memory, cognitive, and functional impairments of AD are partially mediated by insufficient cholinergic output.  Cholinesterase inhibitors (eg, donepezil) enhance cholinergic neurotransmission to compensate for this defect.  "

  "explanation_2": "This patient's presentation is consistent with #febrile seizure#, a generally #benign# neurologic condition characterized by seizure and elevated temperature (≥38 C [100.4 F]) without signs of CNS infection (eg, nuchal rigidity) or metabolic abnormality.  Children age #6 months to 5 years# are almost exclusively affected because seizure threshold is lower during early years of brain development.  In addition, young children are particularly susceptible to febrile #viral illnesses# (eg, roseola, influenza) associated with #high fever# (≥39.5 C [103 F]), a key risk factor for development of seizures due to #hyperthermia-induced neuronal dysfunction#. $A simple febrile seizure is characterized by a generalized seizure (eg, unresponsiveness, tonic-clonic movements) that is short (<15 min) and does not recur within 24 hours.  Benzodiazepines can be used to abort seizures lasting ≥5 mins; however, most self-resolve prior to presentation.  Treatment primarily involves #antipyretics# (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), which #decrease fever# by inhibiting prostaglandin E2 synthesis and counteracting the effects of circulating cytokines, resulting in reduction of the thermoregulatory set point in the hypothalamus. $#(Choice B)#  Microbial invasion of the meningeal layers occurs with meningitis, a serious infection that may progress to encephalitis and trigger generalized seizures.  However, meningitis causes other findings not seen in this patient, such as nausea/vomiting, photophobia, nuchal rigidity, and prolonged confusion (ie, persisting after post-ictal period). $#(Choice C)#  Neuronal injury from cross-reacting antiviral antibodies describes acute cerebellar ataxia, which often occurs in children following a viral illness but presents with gait instability, impaired coordination, and tremor. $#(Choice D)#  Severe neuronal loss and gliosis in the hippocampus (ie, hippocampal sclerosis) causes mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.  Although this condition is associated with a history of childhood febrile seizures, it usually presents in young adults as focal-onset seizures (rather than generalized-onset seizures) characterized by unilateral motor symptoms, a rising epigastric sensation, and auditory/olfactory auras. $#(Choice E)#  Absence seizures are initiated by synchronized slow-wave discharge of thalamocortical tracts.  Although these seizures are more common in children with a history of febrile seizures, they are characterized by staring spells of <20 seconds, not unresponsiveness for 40 seconds with shaking movements. $#Educational objective# Febrile seizure is usually a benign neurologic disorder that occurs most commonly in children age 6 months to 5 years who have high fever due to a viral illness.  The pathophysiology involves hyperthermia-induced neuronal dysfunction triggering a short generalized seizure; treatment is generally supportive with antipyretics for fever reduction.  "

An #aura# may precede the headache in some patients and is most commonly visual (eg, scotoma) or sensory (eg, unilateral extremity paresthesia). $The pathogenesis of migraines is multifactorial with a genetic predisposition to #increased cerebral excitability#, allowing a wave of #cortical spreading depression# to propagate across the cerebral cortex.  Cortical spreading depression is likely involved in generating the pre-migraine #aura# and is associated with the abnormal activation of #trigeminal afferents#, which extend to the meninges and intracranial vasculature.  This activation results in the release of #calcitonin gene-related peptide# (CGRP), a neuropeptide involved in #pain transmission#.  CGRP also causes local vasodilation and increased neurogenic inflammation, which can further sensitize trigeminal afferents and increase pain. $The role of CGRP in migraine pathogenesis has been supported by the effectiveness of triptans ([5-HT1B/1D] receptor agonists that decrease CGRP release) and anti-CGRP antibodies (eg, erenumab) in treating migraine headaches. $#(Choice A)#  Pheochromocytoma is a catecholamine-producing adrenal medullary tumor that causes brief (<1 hr) episodic headaches associated with sweating, palpitations, and hypertension (rather than an aura). $#(Choice B)#  Amplification of epidermal growth factor receptors is associated with the development of astrocytoma and glioblastoma.  Headache and vomiting due to increased intracranial pressure are common but typically associated with other neurologic manifestations (eg, seizures, focal neurologic deficits). $#(Choice C)#  Orexin A and B are excitatory neuropeptides that are produced in the lateral hypothalamus during wakefulness and inhibit the transition to REM sleep.  Instead of episodic headaches, deficiency of these neuropeptides causes the daytime sleepiness, inappropriate bouts of REM sleep (ie, sleep attacks), and emotionally triggered transient muscle weakness (ie, cataplexy) seen in narcolepsy. $#(Choice D)#  Dysfunction of the thalamocortical fiber calcium channels can contribute to the development of absence seizures, which are brief (10-20 sec) staring episodes with impairment of consciousness, not recurrent headaches. $#Educational objective# Migraines are episodic, unilateral, throbbing headaches associated with nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light.  The pathogenesis of migraines involves a genetic predisposition to increased cerebral excitability (eg, cortical spreading depression), which leads to abnormal neuronal activation of trigeminal afferents and the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide, a vasoactive neuropeptide involved in the transmission of pain signals.

Other classic clinical features include a horizontal gaze paralysis, obtundation, and \"locked in\" syndrome, in which patients are aware but unable to move or communicate verbally. $Decreased plasma osmolality from hyponatremia (common in patients with alcohol abuse) results in water flowing across the osmotic gradient into brain cells; if this happens acutely, life-threatening cerebral edema can occur.  However, with slowly developing (chronic) hyponatremia, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes excrete osmotically active organic solutes (eg, glutamate, myoinositol) to cause compensatory intracellular water loss and normalization of brain volume.  Therefore, chronic hyponatremia can present with minimal neurologic symptoms. $However, #overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia# (eg, bolus of normal saline) reverses the osmotic gradient, drawing water from the cells into the plasma.  The astrocytes and oligodendrocytes are unable to rapidly re-accumulate the lost organic solutes, resulting in cell shrinkage, dehydration, and apoptosis.  The resultant demyelination preferentially affects the pons, possibly because the cells there are less metabolically active and less able to rapidly regenerate organic solutes. $#(Choice A)#  Vertebrobasilar atheroma formation can result in a pontine stroke with similar symptoms; however, ischemia (not demyelination) is expected on MRI. $#(Choice B)#  Septic emboli (hematogenous spread of bacteria or fungi) are typically associated with endocarditis.

Korsakoff syndrome (chronic memory impairment) can also occur.  Mamillary body atrophy is often visible on MRI. $#(Choice E)#  Paraneoplastic production of anti-neuronal antibodies can be seen in a variety of malignancies (eg, small cell lung cancer, thymoma), but symptoms are often nonfocal (eg, altered mentation, seizures).  Demyelination is unexpected. $#Educational objective# Osmotic demyelination syndrome results from overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia.

Hyperpyrexia occurs because excessive circulating levels of T3 and T4 increase cellular metabolism and adrenergic tone.

Shivering may occur, but not sustained muscle contraction or acute hypercarbia. $#(Choice D)#  Heat dissipation occurs primarily by cutaneous vasodilation and sweating.  These mechanisms can be impaired by aging or medications (eg, atropine).  During an MH crisis, cutaneous heat removal is unaffected, but heat production far outstrips heat dissipation. $#(Choice E)#  Excessive serotonergic activity in the CNS can result in hyperpyrexia (due to serotonin syndrome).  However, it classically presents with hyperreflexia and clonus (rather than rigidity) and is seen in patients taking serotonergic medications (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants), especially in combination, rather than with anesthesia. $#Educational objective# In patients with malignant hyperthermia, exposure to certain anesthetic agents (eg, succinylcholine, inhalational gasses) causes unregulated passage of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the intracellular space.

Alternately, her presentation can be explained by a clot in the cerebral venous system (ie, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis [CVST]), which can also present with signs of increased ICP without obvious head CT findings. $IIH and CVST are thought to share a similar pathophysiology.  @Cerebrospinal fluid@ (CSF) normally flows through the ventricular system until it is reabsorbed by the arachnoid granulations, after which it drains into the cerebral venous sinuses.

However, @cerebral edema@ is usually appreciated on CT scan, revealing flattening of the ventricles, effaced gyri, and a decrease in gray-white differentiation. $#(Choice E)#  Neurodegenerative diseases (eg, Alzheimer) can lead to decreased brain volume, which may allow the CSF spaces to expand (hydrocephalus ex vacuo).  This tends to occur slowly, so the ICP has time to equilibrate and remain in the normal range. $#Educational objective# Elevated intracranial pressure in the absence of an intracranial mass lesion or ventriculomegaly is suggestive of decreased resorption of cerebrospinal fluid.

Loss of insulation results in #delayed# (or blocked) #nerve conduction velocity#. $• #Axonal neuropathies# are caused by damage to the nerve axon.  Loss of axon fibers results in #reduced signal amplitude#. $This patient has a delay in left-sided ulnar conduction velocity, indicating a #demyelinating ulnar mononeuropathy#.  Focal nerve #compression# (eg, compression of the ulnar nerve at the elbow) is the most common cause of mononeuropathy and results in nerve ischemia, leading to apoptosis of Schwann cells and #localized demyelination#.  In addition to sensory symptoms, patients with ulnar neuropathy may also have weakness of the fourth and fifth digits, elbow pain, and worsening of symptoms with elbow or wrist flexion.  Severe disease can lead to wasting of the hand muscles and an @ulnar claw deformity@. $#(Choice A)#  An axonal neuropathy would primarily show diminished amplitude, rather than reduced velocity of nerve conduction.  Common causes of axonal neuropathy include diabetes mellitus, toxins (eg, chemotherapeutic drugs), hypothyroidism, vitamin B12 deficiency, and vasculitis. $#(Choice B)#  Neuronal cell bodies are located in the dorsal root ganglia and the anterior horn of the spinal cord.  Neuronal cell body damage could potentially result in reduced signal amplitude if there is secondary axonal degeneration. $#(Choice C)#  Myasthenia gravis is due to autoimmune attack on the acetylcholine receptors of the postsynaptic membrane.  This causes fatigable weakness of the ocular, facial, and proximal muscles.  NCS is typically normal, but muscle stimulation studies demonstrate a reduction in motor signal strength with repetitive stimuli. $#(Choice E)#  Botulinum toxin blocks acetylcholine release from presynaptic membranes of the neuromuscular junction by impairing fusion of secretory vesicles with the synaptic membrane.  Patients typically develop cranial neuropathies with symmetric, descending flaccid paralysis.  NCS is typically normal; muscle stimulation studies may show a reduction in motor signal strength that improves with repetitive stimuli. $#Educational objective# Ulnar neuropathy is characterized by numbness of the fourth and fifth digits, pain, and weakness.  It is most commonly caused by compressive injury, leading to tissue ischemia and demyelination (Schwann cell injury).  A nerve conduction study can help differentiate demyelinating versus axonal neuropathies; demyelination causes slowed or blocked nerve conduction velocity whereas axonal injury leads to a reduction in signal strength.

Transected nerves undergo @wallerian degeneration@, which involves axonal dissolution while activated Schwann cells and macrophages degrade myelin.  In addition to clearing cellular debris, Schwann cells and macrophages stimulate formation of a growth cone from the proximal axon stump to facilitate #nerve regeneration#.  However, if the regenerating axons #cannot find their distal target#, regeneration can result in formation of a disorganized mass of axonal processes, Schwann cells, vascular hyalinization, and fibrosis known as a #neuroma#. $Chronic axonal injury or inflammation (such as occurs with a neuroma) induces increased expression of voltage-gated #sodium channels#, which are important for the generation and #propagation of action potentials#.  The density of voltage-gated sodium channels correlates with the excitability of nerves; therefore, the upregulated sodium channels in injured nerves and neuromas increase nociceptive (pain) sensitivity. $To support the diagnosis of a neuroma, @local anesthetic@, which blocks sodium channels in the neuronal cell membrane, is administered to prevent depolarization of the nerve.  This often provides immediate relief of pain. $#(Choice A)#  Action potential propagation depends on voltage-gated calcium channels in certain @cardiac conduction tissues@ (eg, sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes).  However, peripheral nerve depolarization is driven primarily by sodium, rather than calcium, influx. $#(Choice B)#  The influx of negative chloride ions often causes hyperpolarization, which inhibits formation of action potentials. $#(Choice C)#  Magnesium selective ion channels are not directly involved in nerve depolarization.  However, magnesium ions block calcium channels, preventing calcium influx at the axon terminal.  This impairs release of neurotransmitter vesicles into the synapse, inhibiting impulse transmission. $#(Choice D)#  The efflux of potassium out of the cell leads to @hyperpolarization@.  Therefore, upregulation of potassium channels would tend to keep the membrane potential away from the depolarization threshold, leading to less signal transmission (ie, less pain). $#Educational objective# A neuroma forms when regenerating axons are unable to find their distal target and create a haphazard mass of axons and supporting cells.  Upregulation of voltage-gated sodium channels, which generate and propagate action potentials, is likely responsible for the increased pain of these lesions.  ",

She has no cardinal motor symptoms of PD: bradykinesia, tremor, or rigidity.  However, neuroimaging reveals significant nigrostriatal atrophy, with 50% loss of volume. $It is critical to note that motor impairment is not evident until a major loss (typically >60%) of substantia nigra (SN) dopaminergic neurons has already occurred.  Neuronal loss begins #10-20 years prior# to the onset of typical motor parkinsonism.  During this period, known as #prodromal# or premotor PD, powerful #compensatory mechanisms# counteract presynaptic dopamine deficiency: $• In the surviving presynaptic SN neurons, de novo dopamine synthesis is stimulated by the upregulation of tyrosine hydroxylase expression and activity #(choice B).# $• In the synapse, dopamine reuptake is inhibited due to the downregulation of dopamine transporters.  This assists in preserving dopamine levels in the synaptic cleft #(choice C).#  However, because there is severe loss of SN dopaminergic neurons overall, total synaptic dopamine levels are still lower than those of healthy subjects #(choice D).# $• In the postsynaptic striatal neurons, there is compensatory #proliferation of dopamine receptors# (particularly D2R) and enhanced receptor clustering, which work in tandem to augment dopamine signaling. $As nigrostriatal dopamine depletion worsens, these compensatory mechanisms are defeated, and the motor symptoms of PD are unmasked.  Very subtle motor difficulties, especially in tasks requiring finesse and nimble movement (eg, double-clicking mouse), may be the earliest findings. $Because #nonmotor# manifestations are driven by alpha-synuclein neuronal toxicity, rather than dopamine deficiency, they are the hallmark of prodromal PD.  #Autonomic dysfunction# is common due to alpha-synuclein invasion of the enteric nervous system (gut hypomotility, #constipation#) and vascular sympathetic nerves (#orthostatic hypotension#), as seen in this patient.  Invasion of the brainstem sleep centers produces REM behavior disorder, a highly specific prodromal presentation; 90% of patients are diagnosed with an alpha-synucleinopathy within 10 years. $#(Choice A)#  Blockade of postsynaptic dopamine receptors in the basal ganglia occurs in drug-induced parkinsonism (eg, antipsychotic agents), which is clinically indistinguishable from idiopathic PD.  In drug-induced parkinsonism, SN dopaminergic neurons are intact and synaptic dopamine levels are normal. $#Educational objective# The majority of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons (>60%) are lost prior to the onset of motor symptoms in idiopathic Parkinson disease.  During this prodromal period, dopamine depletion is offset by several compensatory mechanisms, including the upregulation of postsynaptic dopamine receptors.  "

When an action potential depolarizes the presynaptic terminal membrane, voltage-gated calcium channels open, causing an influx of extracellular calcium into the synaptic terminal.  This calcium current stimulates fusion of the presynaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane and exocytosis of ACh.  The nicotinic ACh receptors on the postsynaptic skeletal muscle end plate are ligand-gated sodium and potassium ion channels.  The increased sodium and potassium conductance that occurs with ACh binding generates a motor end plate potential that signals for depolarization of the muscle cell membrane.  ACh in the synaptic cleft is degraded by acetylcholinesterase. $#(Choice A)#  Rapid sodium influx is responsible for the upstroke of the action potential in skeletal muscle, smooth muscle, cardiac muscle and Purkinje fibers.  In contrast, the initial upstroke of the action potential in the SA node depends on calcium influx. $#(Choice C - F)#  Second messengers do not play a role in the release of synaptic vesicle contents (ACh) at the neuromuscular junction. $#Educational objective# Acetylcholine release from presynaptic terminal vesicles at the neuromuscular junction depends upon the influx of extracellular calcium into the presynaptic terminal.

Binding of antibodies to these receptors results in blockade of the receptor's active site, receptor internalization and degradation, and damage to the motor end plate due to complement fixation.  This leads to #decreased numbers of functional acetylcholine receptors# at the neuromuscular junction. $The decrease in the number of available cation channels reduces the end plate potential following acetylcholine release.  Because the #threshold potential is not reached#, the #muscle cells do not depolarize# as frequently.  Synaptic concentrations of acetylcholine are unaffected, unlike in botulism or Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome. $#(Choice A)#  Excitation-contraction coupling refers to the process whereby the muscle's action potential triggers cellular contraction.  In skeletal muscle, this process begins with the release of calcium into the cytoplasm, which subsequently binds troponin C and induces a conformational change, allowing actin and myosin to bind.  Impaired coupling implies that an action potential occurs, but the skeletal muscle cannot contract (eg, impaired actin and myosin binding), whereas MG is caused by a failure to achieve the threshold for an action potential to occur. $#(Choices B, C, and D)#  The action potential amplitude, propagation velocity, and refractory period of the muscle cell are determined by intrinsic properties of the cell membrane.  In MG, only the neuromuscular junction is impacted, so the action potential amplitude, propagation velocity, and refractory period are normal when an action potential is actually triggered in the cell.  In contrast, the compound muscle action potential (ie, the summed action potentials of all the muscle fibers in a motor unit) decreases with repeated excitation in patients with MG due to depolarization of fewer myofibers. $#Educational objective# Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease that causes a decreased number of functional acetylcholine receptors within the neuromuscular junction.  This reduces the number of postsynaptic cation channels that can open in response to acetylcholine, which reduces the amplitude of motor end plate potential and prevents muscle fiber depolarization.

  "explanation_2": "#Narcolepsy# is a chronic sleep disorder characterized by frequent, overwhelming urges to sleep.  It is commonly associated with #cataplexy#, a sudden loss of muscle tone that occurs in response to intense (usually positive) emotions.  Narcolepsy results from the depletion of hypocretin (also known as orexin)-secreting neurons in the lateral hypothalamus that are involved in maintaining wakefulness. $Patients with narcolepsy experience shortened sleep latency and typically enter rapid eye movement (REM) sleep almost immediately.  They commonly experience intrusions of REM sleep phenomena during sleep-wake transitions, including #hypnagogic# (upon falling asleep) and #hypnopompic# (upon awakening) #hallucinations# and #sleep paralysis# (inability to move immediately after awakening).  The clinical diagnosis of narcolepsy can be confirmed by #low cerebrospinal fluid# levels of #hypocretin-1# or shortened REM sleep latency on polysomnography. $#(Choice A)#  This patient is experiencing hypnagogic hallucinations, which are characteristic of narcolepsy.  Brief psychotic disorder is diagnosed when one or more positive psychotic symptoms are present for less than a month in the absence of another medical disorder or substance use. $#(Choice B)#  Delayed sleep-wake phase disorder most often presents in adolescence and is characterized by intact duration and quality of sleep that is shifted to a later bedtime and wake time. $#(Choice C)#  Idiopathic hypersomnia is diagnosed when excessive and impairing daytime sleepiness cannot be explained by another sleep disorder.  Patients with idiopathic hypersomnia have persistent daytime sleepiness rather than \"sleep attacks.\"  Unlike patients with narcolepsy, they typically do not feel refreshed after naps. $#(Choice D)#  Insufficient sleep may result in excessive daytime sleepiness, napping, and quicker REM onset, but it is not associated with cataplexy or sleep-related hallucinations. $#(Choice F)#  Obstructive sleep apnea, the most common cause of excessive daytime sleepiness, is characterized by loud snoring, gasping, and apneas during sleep.  It is caused by upper airway obstruction and is not associated with cataplexy, sleep-related hallucinations, or sleep paralysis. $#(Choice G)#  Patients with REM sleep behavior disorder lose normal sleep paralysis during REM sleep and, as a result, act out the content of their dreams (eg, punching, kicking). $#Educational objective# Narcolepsy is a chronic sleep disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, and REM sleep-related phenomena (ie, hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations, sleep paralysis).

  "explanation_2": "$Ischemic neuron death (eg, stroke) typically extends beyond the borders of the primary infarction zone.  #Glutamate-induced excitotoxicity# has emerged as a key player in the outward propagation of injury.  The main events in this process are as follows: $• #Ischemic glutamate release:#  Within minutes of focal cerebral ischemia, neurons #depolarize# because of ATP depletion.  Neuronal depolarization causes exocytosis of glutamate-containing vesicles.  Clearance of glutamate is also impaired due to astrocyte dysfunction.  The result is a sudden, massive surge of glutamate into the extracellular space. $• #NMDA receptor activation:#  Glutamate enters the synaptic cleft.  The @glutamate NMDA receptor@ is activated, increasing the conductance of cations and causing depolarization (and additional glutamate release) from neurons adjacent to the infarct core. $• #Intracellular calcium overload:#  Opening of the NMDA receptors causes #calcium influx# into the cell.  Fluctuations of cytoplasmic calcium are normally buffered by the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum.  Rapid calcium overload overwhelms the cell, causing mitochondrial dysfunction, free radical formation, and calcium-dependent protease activation. $• #Neuron death:#  The neuron suffers energetic failure (mitochondrial dysfunction) and macromolecule damage (eg, membrane lipid peroxidation, DNA cleavage).  The neuron ultimately dies, ruptures, and releases more glutamate. $This vicious cycle of depolarization (excitotoxicity) and glutamate release has been identified as a final common pathway of brain tissue loss (eg, ischemic stroke, traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer dementia).  NMDA receptor antagonists (eg, memantine) have neuroprotective effects for some patients with neurodegenerative diseases. $#(Choices A and D)#  Dopamine and norepinephrine can increase neuronal calcium levels by activating calcium release from intracellular stores through the inositol triphosphate, second-messenger pathway.  This homeostatic process promotes neuron growth and survival rather than cytotoxicity.  Because these metabotropic (ie, G-protein coupled) receptors do not activate calcium channels in the plasma membrane, they do not depolarize the neuron on binding. $#(Choice C)#  Glycine is an inhibitory neurotransmitter found primarily in the spinal cord rather than the brain.  It acts on a ligand-gated ion channel that permits passage of chloride anions, causing hyperpolarization rather than excitation. $#(Choice E)#  The 5-HT3 serotonin receptor is the only isoform that acts as a ligand-gated cation channel causing depolarization; however, this is mediated primarily by sodium and potassium, rather than calcium, influx.  Furthermore, all other serotonin receptors are G-protein coupled, acting through second messengers (cyclic AMP). $#Educational objective# Glutamate is released from injured neurons, causing pathologic hyperactivation of NMDA receptors and leading to depolarization, calcium overload, and death of neighboring cells.  This cascade of excitotoxicity contributes to neurodegeneration and propagation of neuron death after focal injury.  ",

These components trigger the release of #inflammatory cytokines# (eg, tumor necrosis factor–alpha, interferon-gamma, interleukin 12), leading to loosening of the tight junctions of the blood-brain barrier, vasogenic edema, elevation of intracranial pressure, and recruitment of leukocytes. $#Streptococcus pneumoniae#, a gram-positive diplococcus, is the leading cause of acute bacterial meningitis in adults.  Initial antibiotic therapy against S pneumoniae lyses the bacteria and releases cell wall components that increase cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inflammatory cytokines.  Studies have shown that pretreatment with #dexamethasone reduces the levels of inflammatory cytokines# in the CSF and limits risk of inflammation-induced morbidity (eg, seizures, focal neurologic deficits) and death.  Other forms of bacterial meningitis, such as those due to Neisseria meningitidis and Haemophilus influenzae, do not benefit from glucocorticoid pretreatment, possibly because these gram-negative organisms have thinner cell walls (less peptidoglycan and no teichoic acid), resulting in less inflammatory cytokine release. $#(Choice A)#  Therapeutic hypothermia (32-34 C [89.6-93.2 F]) can be used after hypoxic/ischemic brain injury due to cardiac arrest.  It reduces cerebral metabolic activity and limits metabolic strain within damaged neurologic tissue.  This has been shown to improve neurologic recovery and long-term outcomes. $#(Choice C)#  The inflammatory response to bacterial components in the CSF loosens the tight junctions of the blood-brain barrier, which aids antibiotic penetration into the central nervous system.  Dexamethasone reduces the inflammatory response and would be expected to decrease permeability of the blood-brain barrier. $#(Choice D)#  Glucocorticoids promote the release of granulocytes from the bone marrow and the movement of neutrophils off the endothelial wall into the systemic circulation.  This often leads to an increase in the circulating white blood cell count with delayed migration into infected tissues. $#(Choice E)#  Glucocorticoids can cause a dose-dependent increase in fasting serum glucose levels due to stimulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis and inhibition of glucose uptake in adipose tissue.  Although this increases the delivery of glucose to the brain, the primary reason glucocorticoids are protective in those with S pneumoniae meningitis is a reduction in brain inflammation. $#Educational objective# Pneumococcal meningitis is associated with massive cerebrospinal fluid inflammatory cytokine release in response to bacterial cell wall components.  Treatment with dexamethasone prior to antibiotic therapy has been shown to reduce inflammation and decrease the risk of adverse outcomes (eg, seizures, focal neurologic deficits) and death.

Vitamin E is a lipid-soluble, antioxidant vitamin that is widely available in the diet; deficiency is rare and typically occurs in patients with fat malabsorption (eg, cystic fibrosis) or abetalipoproteinemia.

The spinal cord is not affected, so proprioception remains intact and ataxia does not occur. $#(Choice C)#  Lead intoxication is usually asymptomatic but can cause nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, constipation, abdominal pain) and neurobehavioral problems (eg, poor memory, difficulty concentrating).  Severe toxicity may lead to encephalopathy and ataxia, but spinal cord degeneration would not be seen. $#(Choice D)#  Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a prion disease that presents with progressive dementia and myoclonic jerks of the extremities.

Although patients with temporal lobe epilepsy for several years can exhibit cerebellar atrophy with accompanying ataxia, this patient has only had seizure activity for 4 months and has no evidence of ataxia on examination. $#(Choice C)#  The nondominant parietal lobe plays a role in nonverbal spatial mapping and orientation.  A seizure affecting this part of the brain can cause distortions in a patient's sense of position (eg, a feeling of floating, changes in posture) or visual interpretation (eg, the size of objects). $#(Choice D)#  The occipital pole contains the primary visual cortex.  Seizures that originate in the occipital pole characteristically have visual auras (eg, flashing lights, visual distortions, complex hallucinations). $#(Choice E)#  The premotor frontal cortex is responsible for the selection of movements in response to internal and external cues.  A seizure affecting this part of the brain can result in abnormal posturing or repetitive movements, but abdominal and olfactory auras would not be seen. $#Educational objective# Recurrent focal impaired awareness seizures that are preceded by a distinctive aura (eg, uneasy epigastric sensation, olfactory hallucinations) are characteristic of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.  The most common etiology is hippocampal sclerosis (mesial temporal sclerosis), which is associated with childhood febrile seizures.  ",

ROS can mediate cellular damage of DNA, cell membranes, proteins, and enzymes, leading to widespread neuronal death. $#Therapeutic hypothermia# (maintenance of temperature at 33-35 C [91.4-95 F]) leads to improved neurologic outcomes in a variety of hypoxia-induced injuries (eg, after cardiac arrest, seizures).  The formation of ROS after ischemic injury is temperature dependent, so it can be decreased by therapeutic hypothermia.  In addition, therapeutic hypothermia decreases cerebral blood flow, oxygen consumption, and glucose metabolism, thereby #decreasing the formation of ROS# due to both cellular metabolism and reperfusion. $Therapeutic hypothermia has other beneficial effects, including lowering intracranial pressure, reducing excitatory neurotransmitters, and decreasing activation of inflammatory and apoptotic pathways (eg, blocks tumor necrosis factor and caspase pathways). $#(Choice A)#  Therapeutic hypothermia impairs both platelets and clotting factors, which, rather than being neuroprotective, can lead to an increased risk of bleeding complications (eg, intracranial hemorrhage).    $#(Choice C)#  In neonates with severe hyperbilirubinemia, unbound, lipid-soluble bilirubin can cross the blood-brain barrier.  This neurotoxic bilirubin preferentially deposits in the basal ganglia and brainstem nuclei, leading to permanent neurologic damage.  The primary treatment for hyperbilirubinemia converts bilirubin to a more water-soluble form (isomers) that can be excreted.  However, this is accomplished through phototherapy rather than therapeutic hypothermia. $#(Choice D)#  This patient has anion gap metabolic acidosis due to lactic acidosis caused by tissue hypoxia.  Although the liver is responsible primarily for clearing lactate, its rate of clearance does not seem to be significantly impacted by therapeutic hypothermia.  Rather, lactic acidosis typically improves after an increase in oxygenation and the restoration of circulation. $#Educational objective# Neuronal damage after hypoxic-ischemic injury is often related to the formation of reactive oxygen species, which mediate widespread cellular damage.

GBS represents a group of immune-mediated demyelinating polyneuropathies that are thought to be caused by #molecular mimicry#.  An antecedent event (typically an infection) provokes an immune response that cross-reacts with the Schwann cells and myelin sheath of the peripheral nerves.  The myelin sheath is stripped from the axon, leading to loss of neuronal conductivity and axonal degeneration.  Up to one-third of GBS cases are preceded by #Campylobacter jejuni# infection, a common cause of acute (sometimes bloody) #diarrhea#.  Less common antecedent infections include upper respiratory viral illnesses, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, Zika virus, and HIV. $Patients with GBS experience #symmetric#, #ascending weakness# that typically begins in the legs and progresses to flaccid paralysis and respiratory failure.

Salmonella typically causes nonbloody diarrhea and may lead to bacteremia, particularly in an asplenic patient.  Rotavirus, most commonly seen in children, causes nonbloody diarrhea and can lead to gastrointestinal obstruction due to small bowel intussusception. $#(Choice F)#  Zika virus is associated with GBS; however, patients with Zika virus typically present with a pruritic maculopapular rash, low-grade fever, arthralgias, and conjunctivitis rather than diarrhea. $#Educational objective# Guillain-Barré syndrome represents a group of immune-mediated polyneuropathies that are thought to be caused by molecular mimicry, leading to demyelination of the peripheral nerves.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient with painful muscle spasms and neck/jaw contraction likely has #tetanus#, which is caused by the spore-forming anaerobic bacterium Clostridium tetani.  C tetani spores are found in soil worldwide and are typically transmitted to humans during a #puncture injury# (eg, dirty needle use, splinter).  The low oxygen tension of a puncture wound allows spores to germinate into vegetative rod-shaped bacteria that proliferate locally and produce tetanospasmin (#tetanus toxin#). $Although the pathogen is noninvasive (it stays localized to the wound site), the toxin enters the presynaptic terminals of the lower motor neurons and travels by #retrograde axonal transport# to the CNS.  In the spinal cord, at the level of the anterior horn cells, the toxin #blocks# the release of neurotransmitters from #inhibitory interneurons#, leading to spasmodic muscle contraction. $Classic findings include jaw stiffness due to masseter muscle spasm (trismus/lockjaw) and sustained contraction of the facial muscles, producing a bizarre \"smiling\" appearance (risus sardonicus).  Spasmodic contraction of the back and neck can cause opisthotonos.  Intermittent muscle spasms are frequently triggered by sensory stimuli (eg, loud noises, light, touch).  Respiratory muscle involvement can lead to respiratory failure. $#(Choice A)#  Rabies virus is transmitted via the saliva of an infected animal during a bite wound.  The virus spreads by retrograde axonal transport through peripheral nerves and enters the spinal cord/CNS.  Patients with rabies usually develop painful pharyngeal spasms, hydrophobia, fever, and hyperactivity.  However, this patient has no history of an animal bite; he likely developed tetanus due to a puncture wound with a contaminated needle. $#(Choice B)#  Food-borne botulism is marked by the ingestion of preformed botulism toxin with subsequent spread through the systemic circulation.  The toxin blocks cholinergic presynaptic nerve terminals, which results in symmetric, descending weakness. $#(Choice C)#  Bacteria (eg, Staphylococcus aureus) from a wound can spread through the bloodstream to the brain leading to brain abscess.  Symptoms vary but the most common manifestation is unilateral headache. $#(Choice D)#  Diphtheria is associated with the formation of a pseudomembranous pharyngeal exudate and the elaboration of diphtheria toxin into the systemic circulation.  The toxin causes cardiac (myocarditis) and neurologic toxicity. $#(Choice E)#  Herpes simplex virus type 1 causes orolabial lesions and is the most frequent cause of sporadic encephalitis, which occurs when the virus spreads via the trigeminal nerve or olfactory tract to the temporal lobe.  Patients usually present with confusion, fever, focal neurologic deficits, and seizures. $#Educational objective# Tetanus is caused by infection with toxigenic strains of the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium tetani.  Transmission typically occurs when spores are inoculated into the skin via a puncture wound.  The bacteria germinate, replicate locally, and elaborate tetanospasmin (tetanus toxoid).  The toxin spreads in a retrograde fashion through the lower motor neurons to the spinal cord, where it blocks inhibitory interneurons and causes spasmodic muscle contraction (eg, trismus, risus sardonicus).

  "explanation_2": "$#Acute bacterial meningitis# is a life-threatening infection that classically presents with the triad of fever, nuchal rigidity, and altered mental state.  Most cases are caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (gram-positive coccus) and #Neisseria meningitidis# (gram-negative diplococcus).  These pathogens are transmitted via aerosolized droplets and are able to #colonize the nasopharynx# due to the presence of specialized surface components (eg, fimbriae, pili).  Colonization usually leads to an asymptomatic carrier state, but in a minority of patients (~0.2%), the bacteria penetrate the epithelium and enter the #bloodstream#.  Intravascular survival is dependent on capsular polysaccharides, which allow the bacteria to evade destruction by the alternative complement system.  Meningitis occurs when the bacteria penetrate the cerebral capillary endothelium or the #choroid plexus#, the location of blood-CSF barrier. $#(Choice A)#  Haemophilus influenzae and S pneumoniae can rarely spread into the meninges from a middle ear infection.  However, an ear infection is very uncommon cause of meningitis. $#(Choice C)#  Spread from the pharynx through the nasal lymphatics to the subarachnoid space may contribute to some cases of bacterial meningitis.  However, this route is thought to be far less common than bloodstream invasion with subsequent hematogenous spread. $#(Choice D)#  Infections of the lung (eg, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, S pneumoniae) can lead to bacteremia and meningitis.  However, N meningitidis does not usually colonize or infect the lung. $#(Choice E)#  Traumatic brain injury can lead to CSF leaks, with subsequent infection of the central nervous system.  This is particularly common in the setting of basilar skull fracture.  S pneumoniae (gram-positive cocci in pairs) is the most common organism. $#Educational objective# Neisseria meningitidis is transmitted primarily by aerosolized droplets and subsequently colonizes the nasopharyngeal epithelium.  Penetration of the epithelium can lead to bloodstream infection.  Spread to the meninges occurs via transcellular penetration of the cerebral capillary endothelium or entry at the choroid plexus.

Botulism characteristically presents as a symmetric descending paralysis that first manifests with cranial nerve abnormalities (#diplopia, dysphagia, dysphonia [3Ds]#).  Nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain may also occur in foodborne botulism, which classically occurs 12-36 hours after consumption of contaminated foods that are fermented, preserved, or #canned improperly# at home. $#Botulinum toxin# causes disease by inhibiting nicotinic and muscarinic motor neurons.

However, these agents have no effect on the nicotinic ACh receptors controlling voluntary muscles.  Poisoning due to nicotinic receptor antagonists (eg, pancuronium, tubocurarine) is uncommon because these agents have poor oral absorption. $#Educational objective# Botulinum toxin blocks the presynaptic exocytosis of ACh vesicles, causing impaired muscarinic and nicotinic neurotransmission.

Foodborne botulism is a result of toxin ingestion and is characterized by cranial nerve deficits and descending symmetric paralysis.  #Spore formation#, which occurs in the #subterminal location# (in between the middle and end of the cell), allows the bacteria to survive adverse conditions (eg, heat, high-oxygen environment). $Focal dystonia is a localized, uncontrollable muscle contraction that can lead to pain and physical deformity.  #Torticollis# is a common manifestation of dystonia and is due to involvement of the #sternocleidomastoid# muscle.  Injection of botulinum toxin type B into the dystonic muscle results in muscular relaxation and #relief of symptoms#.  Botulinum toxin can also be used to treat the muscle spasms of multiple sclerosis and Parkinson disease, to relax the lower esophageal sphincter in achalasia, and to reduce the appearance of facial wrinkles.  The localized anticholinergic effect also makes it useful in the treatment of hyperhidrosis.  Effects are temporary (approximately 3 months) due to the regeneration of the nerve terminal with time. $#(Choice A)#  Hypervariable pili are characteristic of Neisseria meningitidis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae; antigenic heterogeneity aids in immune evasion and allows for repeat infections. $#(Choice B)#  The antiphagocytic capsule is a primary virulence factor for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Neisseria meningitidis. $#(Choice C)#  Some obligate intracellular organisms (eg, Chlamydia, mycobacteria) reproduce by forming small, metabolically inactive elementary bodies that are phagocytized by host cells.  Once inside, they evolve to the metabolically active reticulate body. $#(Choice D)#  Endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) is a major virulence factor of @gram-negative bacteria@ (eg, Escherichia coli).  Endotoxin is released with destruction of the bacterial cell wall (eg, antibiotics) or during cell division, in contrast to exotoxins which are often secreted (some exotoxins are release by bacterial lysis).  Clostridium species are gram-positive. $#Educational objective# Clostridium botulinum is a spore-forming, gram-positive, anaerobic bacillus that synthesizes botulinum toxin, which prevents the presynaptic release of acetylcholine from the nerve terminal at the neuromuscular junction.  Botulinum toxin can be used to treat focal dystonia and other disorders of abnormal muscle contraction.  ",

Neisseria meningitidis is a gram-negative diplococcus transmitted via aerosolized respiratory droplets.  Close living conditions (eg, college #dormitories#, prisons, military barracks) promote its spread. $N meningitidis has several virulence factors, including a polysaccharide capsule (impairs phagocytosis of the bacteria), lipo-oligosaccharide (induces cytokine production, leading to circulatory collapse), pili (permit bacterial attachment to the respiratory mucosa), and IgA protease (cleaves secretory IgA that would otherwise inactivate the pili).  Antibodies against the #polysaccharide capsule# confer immunity to N meningitidis. $The meningococcal #vaccines# available in the United States are as follows: $• Quadrivalent conjugate vaccine:  #Capsular polysaccharide antigens# (serogroups A, C, Y, and W) are fused to a diphtheroid toxin carrier, which allows the polysaccharides to be displayed on the major histocompatibility complex of antigen-presenting cells.  This results in stimulation of T-cells and provides a stronger, more lasting immunologic response. $• Serogroup B vaccine:  Capsular polysaccharides from serogroup B are very similar to human neural cell adhesion molecules.  This molecular mimicry prevented a polysaccharide vaccine due to difficulty in generating an immune response without increasing the risk of autoimmunity.  A vaccine against this serogroup is now available that uses #recombinant proteins# instead of capsular polysaccharides. $In the United States, the quadrivalent vaccine is part of routine immunizations; the serogroup B vaccine is recommended for specific high-risk populations (eg, those with asplenia or complement deficiency). $#(Choice B)#  The influenza vaccination typically contains three or four strains of inactivated virus.  Although influenza is often associated with rapid-onset malaise, headache, myalgia, and fever, the presence of nuchal rigidity and purpuric skin rash make meningococcemia more likely. $#(Choice C)#  The diphtheria toxoid is used in conjugate vaccines because it allows the polysaccharide antigen to be displayed on the major histocompatibility complex of antigen presenting cells.  The toxoid is not the primary antigenic component of conjugate vaccines. $#(Choice D)#  The measles-mumps-rubella vaccination contains live attenuated versions of these viruses.  @Measles@ is associated with the 3 C's (coryza, conjunctivitis, cough) and a maculopapular rash, mumps is associated with salivary gland swelling, and @rubella@ is associated with a diffuse maculopapular rash.

Because different muscles (with different sources of innervation) control inspiration and expiration, respiratory function is differentially impaired based on the level of spinal cord injury. $#Inspiration# is driven by an increase in intrathoracic volume.  This is mediated predominantly by contraction of the #diaphragm#, which is innervated by the #phrenic nerve# that originates from the #C3-C5# nerve rootlets.  Accessory muscles of inspiration elevate the sternum and ribs to further expand the thoracic cavity.  These include the external intercostals (innervated by thoracic nerve roots), the sternocleidomastoid (innervated by C1-C4), and the scalenes (innervated by C4-C8). $Passive expiration is driven by the net intrinsic elastic recoil of the lungs, chest wall, ribs, and diaphragm and therefore requires no innervation.  #Active expiration#, as measured in this patient's pulmonary function testing, recruits the musculature to pull the ribs down and compress the abdominal contents to push the diaphragm up and decrease intrathoracic volume.

When systemic blood pressure is 60-140 mm Hg, it has little effect on cerebral blood volume because autoregulation (via cerebral blood vessel dilation and contraction) keeps blood flow constant.

  "explanation_2": "The top panel in this experiment demonstrates a classic @excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP)@, a small depolarization that moves the postsynaptic neuron closer to the threshold for full action potential firing.  The #EPSP# occurs with rising intracellular calcium (bottom panel), indicating that the involved postsynaptic receptor acts, at least in part, by #increasing calcium conductance#. $The @glutamate NMDA receptor@ becomes permeable to cations causing net depolarization (sodium and calcium in > potassium out) when bound by glutamate.  The increased calcium entry also initiates second-messenger signaling cascades (eg, protein kinase C) to regulate synaptic plasticity; repetitive excitation of postsynaptic neurons renders them more responsive, producing stronger EPSPs over time.  This process, known as #long-term potentiation (LTP)#, dictates synaptic strength between hippocampal neurons and plays a critical role in the molecular basis of memory, learning, and addiction. $Because of its role in memory, acute blockade of glutamate NMDA receptors confers the amnestic property of certain medications (eg, ketamine) and some drugs of illicit use (eg, phencyclidine [PCP]).  However, chronic blockade (eg, memantine) can exert #neuroprotective# effects by dampening glutamate-induced excitotoxicity (ie, neuron apoptosis due to calcium overload). $#(Choice A)#  Dopamine can be either excitatory or inhibitory depending on the receptor subtype.  D2 receptors are generally coupled to Gi proteins that inhibit protein kinase A, leading to the opening of potassium channels that inhibit neuronal depolarization. $#(Choice B)#  GABA is the chief inhibitory neurotransmitter, causing postsynaptic hyperpolarization via increased chloride and bicarbonate influx (ie, ionotropic GABA-A ion channel) or increased potassium efflux (ie, metabotropic GABA-B receptor). $#(Choice D)#  The glycine receptor causes inhibitory postsynaptic hyperpolarization via increasing membrane permeability to chloride.  This receptor mediates inhibitory interneuron transmission in the spinal cord. $#(Choice E)#  The norepinephrine alpha2 receptor is located predominantly on presynaptic (not postsynaptic) nerve terminals throughout the CNS and the peripheral nervous system.  Activation of these receptors inhibits norepinephrine release from the nerve terminal, inducing sympatholytic effects (eg, reduced heart rate, vasodilation). $#Educational objective# Glutamate is the main excitatory neurotransmitter of the CNS, inducing postsynaptic neuron depolarization and calcium entry through the NMDA receptor.  Calcium entry programs the neuron to depolarize more robustly to repeated stimulation; this long-term potentiation forms a molecular basis for memory, learning, and addiction.  ",

This depolarization impulse is transmitted from the dendrites through the cell body to the axon hillock, which contains a large number of voltage-gated sodium channels.

Myelin is an electrical insulator and increases the conduction velocity of action potentials; demyelination leads to slowing of the impulses with resultant neurological deficits. $The speed of conduction down an axon depends on 2 constants: the length constant and the time constant (ie, #velocity = length/time#). $• The @length constant@, also known as the space constant, is a measure of how far along an axon an electrical impulse can propagate without requiring active regeneration by ion channels.  It is based on the relative resistance of conduction along the axon (within the cytoplasm) compared to the resistance across the membrane.  Myelin increases the length constant by reducing charge dissipation across the membrane (increasing membrane resistance).  This allows the electrical impulse from individual sodium channels to travel farther, allowing activation of more distant channels.  As such, demyelination will decrease the length constant and result in shorter impulse conduction. $• The @time constant@ is a measure of the time it takes for the membrane potential to respond to a change in membrane permeability (ie, sodium channel activation) and is based on membrane resistance and capacitance.  Myelin decreases membrane capacitance (reduces the amount of charge stored by the membrane) and increases membrane resistance (reduces charge leakage through the membrane) in axon segments between the nodes of Ranvier; this reduces the time constant and allows the membrane potential to change faster.  Demyelination would increase the time constant and result in slower changes in membrane voltage. $Therefore, #demyelination# decreases neuronal signaling velocity both by #decreasing the length constant# and increasing the time constant (ie, ↓ velocity = ↓ length / ↑ time) #(choice E).# $#(Choices B and C)#  @Summation@ refers to the additive effects of multiple postsynaptic potentials on a target neuron's membrane potential.

In the resting hyperpolarized state, magnesium occupies the NMDA receptor ion pore, forming a constitutive magnesium plug to prevent the flow of other cations.  The channel opens when 2 events occur:  $1. #Displacement of the magnesium plug#:  An initial depolarization impulse (non–NMDA mediated) causes loss of negative potential, displacing magnesium from the NMDA ion channel pore.  In dying neurons, this can occur due to loss of the ATP-dependent sodium-potassium gradient.  $2. #Binding of glutamate:#  After magnesium is expelled, binding of glutamate (along with glycine) induces a conformational change, allowing the unrestricted flow of calcium, sodium, and potassium.  Because of selective permeability, the #influx of calcium and sodium# (tends to depolarize) outstrips the efflux of potassium (tends to hyperpolarize), leading to further net depolarization. $Therefore, higher extracellular magnesium levels block the NMDA channel, decreasing the influx of calcium and sodium #(choice C)# to inhibit glutamate-mediated neuron depolarization. $During acute ischemic stroke, a sudden, massive rise in extracellular glutamate occurs within the infarct zone.  Sustained exposure to high glutamate levels causes intracellular #calcium overload#, ultimately accumulating in mitochondria, triggering apoptotic neuron death (#excitotoxicity#).  These dying neurons release more glutamate into the extracellular space, creating a @domino effect@ on neighboring neurons, further propagating damage beyond the original ischemic core.  As a result, modulation of the NMDA receptor is an emerging frontier in neuroprotection. $#(Choices B and D)#  The influx of chloride and bicarbonate anions induces hyperpolarization instead of depolarization, and mediates the @inhibitory postsynaptic potentials@ generated by GABA-A channels; NMDA channels are impermeable to anions.  Neurons can also be hyperpolarized by potassium efflux, mediating inhibitory potentials generated by GABA-B channels. $#(Choice E)#  Magnesium itself does not pass through the NMDA channel.  Rather, it regulates passage of other cations through steric hindrance (magnesium plug).  Therefore, magnesium is used therapeutically to block depolarization. $#Educational objective# Excessive activation of the glutamate NMDA receptor causes excitotoxic neuronal death through uncontrolled calcium influx.  At the hyperpolarized resting membrane potential, the NMDA receptor is blocked by a magnesium plug, which is released by non–NMDA-mediated depolarization.  ",

However, by age 6 months the accumulation of glycolipids in the brain results in neuronal destruction.  Subsequent neurologic degeneration typically manifests as #developmental regression#, as seen in this patient who is no longer able to sit or roll over. $Progressive destruction of neurons in the brain and spinal cord leads to #macrocephaly#, seizures, and spasticity; an #exaggerated startle reflex# with acoustic stimuli is the result of brainstem injury.  Ganglioside accumulation also occurs in the retina but spares the fovea, which lacks ganglion cells.  This leads to the characteristic funduscopic finding of a @cherry-red macular spot@, or a bright red unaffected fovea (which reflects the underlying choroid) that is accentuated due to surrounding opacification of the affected macula.  Progressive #neurodegeneration# typically leads to death by age 2-5. $#(Choice A)#  Krabbe disease (galactocerebroside accumulation) is a lysosomal storage disease that causes progressive neurodegeneration.  However, affected infants have optic atrophy, which is visualized as optic nerve pallor rather than a bright red fovea. $#(Choice B)#  Gaucher disease is a lysosomal storage disorder in which glucocerebroside accumulation results in bone pain, hepatosplenomegaly, and bone marrow suppression (eg, anemia, thrombocytopenia).  This patient's normal abdominal examination and bright red fovea makes Gaucher disease unlikely. $#(Choice D)#  Mucopolysaccharidoses (eg, Hurler syndrome, Hunter syndrome) are lysosomal storage disorders characterized by the build-up of glycosaminoglycans such as heparan and dermatan sulfate.  Patients have neurocognitive decline, but coarse facial features and hepatosplenomegaly are also expected.  Although Hurler syndrome is associated with corneal clouding, neither mucopolysaccharidosis causes a cherry-red macula. $#(Choice E)#  Neurodegeneration and a cherry-red macular spot occur in Niemann-Pick disease, which is characterized by sphingomyelin accumulation.  However, hepatosplenomegaly would be present and is not seen here. $#Educational objective# Tay-Sachs disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by β-hexosaminidase A deficiency, which results in GM2 ganglioside accumulation in neuronal lysosomes.  Key clinical features include progressive neurodegeneration (eg, developmental regression), an exaggerated startle reflex, and a cherry-red macular spot.  ",

  "explanation_2": "$This infant with delayed motor development and flaccid paralysis (eg, hypotonia, decreased deep tendon reflexes) likely has #spinal muscular atrophy#.  This condition is caused by mutations in the #survival motor neuron (SMN1) gene#, which encodes a protein involved in assembly of #small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs)# in lower motor neurons.  Defective snRNP assembly results in impaired spliceosome function and degeneration of anterior horn cells in the spinal cord. $RNA molecules that carry out functions without first being translated into proteins are called non-coding RNAs.  These include small nuclear RNA (snRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and transfer RNA (tRNA).  snRNA is transcribed by RNA polymerase II and associates with specific proteins to form snRNPs.  A collection of snRNPs and other proteins on pre-mRNA is referred to as a #spliceosome#.  Spliceosomes #remove introns# from pre-mRNA by cleaving the 5' end of intron 1 (splice donor site) and joining that end to the branch point.  The freed 3'-OH of exon 1 then forms a phosphodiester bond with the 5'-phosphate at the splice acceptor site, joining exons 1 and 2. $#(Choice A)#  Eukaryotic chromatin is composed of repeated subunits called nucleosomes, which consist of double-stranded DNA wrapped around histone protein cores.  Nucleosomes are important for the compact packaging of DNA into chromosomes with the aid of other packaging proteins. $#(Choice B)#  Peroxisomes are cytoplasmic organelles containing oxidative enzymes (eg, catalase, D-amino acid oxidase, uric acid oxidase).  These organelles are ubiquitous among eukaryotes and are most abundant in the liver and kidneys, where detoxification of ingested and environmental materials occurs.  In the liver, peroxisomes also play a role in the breakdown of fatty acids. $#(Choice C)#  Proteasomes and lysosomes are responsible for protein/polypeptide degradation.  Proteasomes mainly degrade intracellular proteins, whereas lysosomes degrade extracellular proteins and worn-out organelles. $#(Choice D)#  Ribosomes are present in the cytoplasm and are required for translation of mRNA into protein.  Individual ribosomes are comprised of rRNA and ribosomal proteins.  Within the cell, rRNA engages mRNA and facilitates tRNA entry during the formation of polypeptide chains. $#Educational objective# Small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) are important components of the spliceosome, a molecule which removes introns from pre-mRNA during processing within the nucleus.  Spinal muscular atrophy is a disorder caused by mutations in the SMN1 gene, resulting in impaired assembly of snRNPs in lower motor neurons.  Infants often have flaccid paralysis due to degeneration of anterior horn cells in the spinal cord.  "

In these conditions, abnormal mitochondria accumulate under the sarcolemma of muscle fibers.  The fibers have an irregular shape and size on cross section.  For this reason, the mitochondrial myopathies are also known as the \"red ragged fiber\" diseases.  Electron microscopy of the affected muscle reveals an increased number of enlarged, abnormally shaped mitochondria. $The most important mitochondrial myopathies are myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF, described in this vignette), Leber optic neuropathy (blindness), and mitochondrial encephalopathy with stroke-like episodes and lactic acidosis (MELAS).  Each of these diseases is the result of a mitochondrial gene mutation. $The mitochondrial diseases are caused by mutations, deletions or duplications of mtDNA.  Because sperm mitochondria do not pass into the ovum during fertilization, only maternal mitochondria are transmitted to the fetus.  Mitochondrial diseases, therefore, have maternal inheritance.  For this reason the male patient described in this vignette will not transmit the disease to his progeny. $#(Choice B)#  No pure single-gene inherited disease shows 75% transmission.  There may be 75% transmission for a disease with variable penetrance. $Individuals affected by a disease with autosomal dominant inheritance receive one copy of the abnormal gene from one parent.  The chance that an affected person will transmit the disease to his/her child is 50% #(choice C)# if the parent is heterozygous for the given disease.  If the parent is homozygous, there is a 100% chance #(choice A) #of transmission. $#(Choice D)#  Autosomal recessive diseases occur when the individual inherits two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent).  If both parents are carriers, there is a 25% chance that the child will be affected. $#Educational objective# \"Red ragged\" muscle fibers are seen in mitochondrial diseases.  Muscle fibers have this appearance because abnormal mitochondria accumulate under the sarcolemma.  Mitochondrial diseases show maternal inheritance.  "

Typical symptoms include intellectual disability, congenital abnormalities (eg, gastrointestinal, cardiac), physical growth delay, and characteristic facial features (eg, flat facies, protruding tongue, epicanthic folds, oblique palpebral fissures).  Many patients with trisomy 21 develop #early-onset Alzheimer disease (AD)#, defined as diagnosis of AD age ≤65, with some developing AD as early as the fourth decade of life. $Characteristic pathologic changes associated with AD involve accumulation of intracellular @neurofibrillary tangles@ and extracellular @amyloid-beta plaques@: $• Neurofibrillary tangles are composed of tau protein, a primary component of intracellular microtubules. In AD, tau protein is hyperphosphorylated, causing microtubule structures to collapse into \"tangles\" that contribute to global neuronal dysfunction. $• Amyloid beta is an abnormal fragment of #amyloid precursor protein#, which is normally involved in synaptic formation and repair.  In AD, the protein is not properly cleared and forms amyloid fragments; these then harden into insoluble plaques that accumulate in brain tissue and vessel walls. $The amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene is located on #chromosome 21#.  The #extra copy of APP# present in trisomy 21 is thought to accelerate amyloid accumulation and lead to early-onset AD. $#(Choice A)#  Amyloid A protein is an acute-phase reactant that is associated with the development of multisystemic amyloidosis (AA amyloidosis) in reaction to chronic disease states (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease). $#(Choice C)#  Apolipoprotein E is found in 3 allelic variations: epsilon 2, 3, and 4.  Those with 1 or 2 copies of the epsilon 4 allele are at greater risk for late-onset AD (ie, AD diagnosed at age >65) compared with those without the allele. $#(Choice D)#  Expansion of CAG trinucleotide repeats in the HTT gene, which codes for huntingtin protein, is responsible for Huntington disease.  Individuals with this condition typically have movement abnormalities (eg, chorea), psychiatric symptoms, and dementia. $#(Choice E)#  Islet amyloid polypeptide is a normal secretory product of pancreatic beta cells that forms cytotoxic deposits in type 2 diabetes mellitus, impairing beta-cell function. $#Educational objective# Patients with trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) have 3 copies of the amyloid precursor protein gene located on chromosome 21.  This increases amyloid-beta accumulation in the brain, placing these patients at high risk for developing early-onset Alzheimer disease.  ",

Hirschsprung disease is a disorder of neural crest cell migration and results in an aganglionic colonic segment, often causing intestinal obstruction.  Spinal cord abnormalities and a cutaneous lumbosacral finding would not be seen. $#(Choice D)#  Failure of notochord separation from the underlying endoderm leads to neurenteric cysts (eg, spinal tumors with gastrointestinal epithelium) rather than spinal dysraphism. $#Educational objective# Closed spinal dysraphism (spina bifida occulta or closed neural tube defect) often presents with cutaneous lumbosacral findings (eg, deep pit, hemangioma, tuft of hair) in the newborn period.  Pathogenesis involves failure of vertebral arch fusion, and imaging may suggest an underlying tethered cord (eg, low-lying conus medullaris, thickened filum terminale).  ",

  "explanation_2": "$Patients at increased risk for congenital defects (eg, maternal age ≥35) may be offered @amniocentesis@ for prenatal diagnosis.  Amniotic fluid consists primarily of fetal urine; therefore, it can contain fetal serum proteins such as alpha-fetoprotein (AFP).  Amniotic fluid does not usually contain #acetylcholinesterase# (AChE), an enzyme normally concentrated in the #cerebrospinal fluid# (CSF).  Therefore, #elevated AChE# on amniocentesis suggests a leak of fetal CSF into the amniotic cavity known as an #open neural tube defect# (NTD). $NTDs occur due to #failed fusion of the neural plate edges# during the fourth week of fetal development.  Fusion begins in the cervical region and proceeds toward the cranial and caudal ends of the neural tube (ie, rostral and caudal neuropores).  Failed rostral neuropore closure causes anencephaly, and failed caudal neuropore closure causes @spina bifida@.  A persistent opening between the neural tube and the amniotic cavity allows leakage of AFP and AChE into the amniotic fluid.  AFP can also cross the placenta and become elevated in the maternal serum. $#(Choice A)#  Duodenal atresia results from impaired recanalization of the duodenum due to failure of epithelial cell apoptosis.  It causes elevated amniotic fluid volume but not elevated AChE on amniocentesis.  The syndactyly of the patient's first child is also an example of failed apoptosis of mesenchyme between the digits. $#(Choices C, E, and F)#  Failed involution of the thyroglossal tract can cause a persistent thyroglossal duct cyst.  @Hirschsprung disease@ involves failed neural crest cell migration into the sigmoid colon/rectum.  Failure of the processus vaginalis to obliterate can lead to congenital hydrocele or @indirect inguinal hernia@.  None of these conditions are associated with increased AChE in the amniotic fluid because they do not involve a persistent opening between the fetal neural tube and the amniotic cavity. $#(Choice D)#  Advanced maternal age is a risk factor for Down syndrome (meiotic nondisjunction of chromosome 21), which presents with low AFP and normal AChE levels in the amniotic fluid. $#Educational objective# Neural tube defects (NTDs) most often occur when the neural folds fail to fuse in the region of the anterior or posterior neuropores.  An open NTD allows leakage of alpha-fetoprotein and acetylcholinesterase into the amniotic fluid, leading to elevated levels detected on amniocentesis.  ",

  "explanation_2": "This patient with an unintended pregnancy has been taking #methotrexate#, a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug, to control symptoms of #rheumatoid arthritis#.  Methotrexate is a folic acid analog that #competitively inhibits# @dihydrofolate reductase@, which produces nucleic acid precursors that are essential to DNA synthesis and repair.  #Rapidly dividing cells# (eg, neural tube cells, stem cells, hepatic cells, epithelial cells) are #particularly susceptible# to folate antagonism.  All patients taking methotrexate should also take a daily folic acid supplement to ameliorate the potential adverse effects (eg, oral ulcers, hepatotoxicity). $Methotrexate and other folate antagonists have #abortifacient# and/or #teratogenic# effects when used during the first trimester.  They are contraindicated in pregnant women except under specific circumstances (eg, cancer therapy with no better alternative, treatment of ectopic pregnancy).  Adverse effects of methotrexate use to the fetus include cardiovascular, urinary tract, and #neural tube defects# (eg, anencephaly, spina bifida). $#(Choice A)#  Under the influence of Hox (homeobox) genes, the branchial arches develop into many head and neck tissues (eg, muscles, bones, and cartilage of the face, neck, and pharynx).  Retinoids (eg, topical tretinoin) are vitamin A derivatives used in the treatment of acne that interfere with the Hox signaling pathways.  If used during pregnancy, they can cause branchial arch abnormalities (eg, CNS, thymic, and craniofacial defects). $#(Choice C)#  Renal dysplasia can be a complication of second or third trimester fetal exposure to ACE inhibitors in hypertensive mothers.  Because fetal renal function is essential to maintain amniotic fluid volume, impaired renal function can lead to pulmonary hypoplasia, limb contractions, growth restriction, or cord compression with poor fetal outcomes. $#(Choice D)#  Sacral agenesis (ie, caudal regression syndrome) is a rare malformation that occurs almost exclusively in infants of diabetic mothers.  Defects can include incomplete development of the sacrum, lumbar vertebrae, and lower extremities. $#(Choice E)#  Skeletal lesions can occur in congenital syphilis infection due to an inflammatory response (eg, periostitis, osteochondritis) to Treponema pallidum spirochetes in highly vascular areas of bones (eg, @Hutchinson teeth@).  Although methotrexate exposure can cause skeletal development abnormalities, discrete inflammatory lesions would not be expected. $#(Choice F)#  Thyroid hypoplasia is a complication of inadvertent fetal exposure to radioactive iodine (I131) in patients receiving treatment for hyperthyroidism or thyroid cancer who unintentionally become pregnant. $#Educational objective# Methotrexate and other folic acid antagonists adversely affect rapidly dividing cells (eg, epithelial cells, stem cells, neural tube cells) by limiting the production of precursors essential to DNA synthesis and repair.

Like other major congenital anomalies, neural tube defects develop during the embryonic stage of fetal development, or #3-8 weeks# after fertilization (ie, weeks 5-10 of gestation).  During this crucial time, the embryo is undergoing #organogenesis#, or rapid cell division and differentiation of all major organ systems, making it particularly #susceptible to teratogens#. $The beginning of the embryonic stage is marked by @gastrulation@, which establishes 3 distinct cell layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm.  All tissues and organs are derived from these 3 layers.

These are benign nerve sheath neoplasms predominantly comprised of #Schwann cells#, which are embryologically derived from the #neural crest#. $#(Choice A)#  The endoderm gives rise to thyroid follicular cells (derived from the primitive tongue) and the epithelial linings of the gastrointestinal tract, middle ear, lungs, bladder, and most of the urethra.  It also gives rise to the bulk of the liver and pancreas, as these structures form from outpouchings of the primitive gut tube. $#(Choice B)#  The mesoderm is divided into paraxial, intermediate, and lateral sections and gives rise to muscles, bones, blood, connective tissue, dermis, and the kidneys/ureters. $#(Choice D)#  The neural tube gives rise to neurons of the central nervous system and the neurohypophysis, retina, pineal gland, preganglionic autonomic fibers, astrocytes, and ependymal cells. $#(Choice E)#  The notochord almost completely regresses in humans, and its only major derivative is the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral disc.  Vertebrae are derived from the paraxial mesoderm. $#(Choice F)#  The surface ectoderm gives rise to the epidermis, lens of the eye, outer layer of the cornea, nasal and oral epithelium, and anal epithelium below the dentate line. $#Educational objective# Neurofibromatosis type I (von Recklinghausen disease) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient's Parkinson symptoms do not improve with intravenous dopamine infusion because dopamine is unable to cross the blood-brain barrier.  The #blood-brain barrier# is formed by tight junctions between nonfenestrated capillary endothelial cells that prevent the #paracellular# passage of fluid and solutes.  #Tight junctions#, also known as zonulae occludentes, are composed of transmembrane proteins (eg, claudins and occludins) that associate with actin filaments, forming a #beltlike seal# around the apical intercellular space.  This seal only permits the passage of substances from the blood to the brain via transcellular movement. $Transcellular movement of dopamine is limited by the molecule's low lipid solubility and the lack of dopamine-specific transport carriers in capillary endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier.  L-DOPA (dopamine precursor) also has low lipid solubility, but it is able to enter the brain due to its high affinity for the large neutral amino acid transporter. $#(Choice A)#  Desmosomes (maculae adherentes) are spotlike junctions that anchor adjacent cells together via keratin intermediate filament interactions.  Autoantibodies against desmosomes in the stratum spinosum of the skin cause pemphigus vulgaris. $#(Choice B)#  Fenestrae are small pores within endothelial cells that allow free fluid exchange between the intravascular and extravascular spaces.  They are found in capillaries perfusing the intestine, renal tubules, and endocrine glands. $#(Choice C)#  Gap junctions are composed of connexin proteins that create channels between cells, permitting the free passage of small ions (eg, Ca2+) and molecules. $#(Choice D)#  Hemidesmosomes are similar to desmosomes but bind the basal layer of epithelial cells to the basement membrane.  Autoantibodies against hemidesmosomes in the skin cause bullous pemphigoid. $#(Choice E)#  Intermediate junctions (zonula adherens or belt desmosomes) are located below tight junctions and form a beltlike anchor between adjacent cells in association with actin microfilaments. $#Educational objective# The blood-brain barrier is formed by tight junctions between nonfenestrated capillary endothelial cells that prevent the paracellular passage of fluid and solutes.  This barrier only permits the passage of substances from the blood to the brain via transcellular movement across the endothelial plasma membrane, which is limited by diffusion or carrier-mediated transport.

Kinesin uses energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to move along the microtubule.  The plus ends of microtubules typically lie at sites distant from the nucleus; thus, in neurons, kinesin carries vesicles and organelles away from the cell body and toward the nerve terminal.  A targeted toxic insult to this protein would be expected to impair anterograde transport resulting in a deficiency of synaptic vesicles at the nerve terminal. $#(Choice A)#  The Nissl substance in neurons corresponds to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. $#(Choice C)#  The transverse tubule (T-tubule) system is a tubular network located at the junction of the A and I bands of striated myocytes.  T-tubules are open to the extracellular space and facilitate the spread of depolarization to the inside of the cell. $#(Choice D)#  Desmosomes are protein aggregates that mediate cell-cell adhesion between epithelial cells. $#(Choice E)#  Microvilli are small cylindrical extensions of the apical plasma membrane that contain actin thin filaments.

Primary infection occurs following contact with an affected individual's saliva.  Although it is often asymptomatic, infection can result in painful blister formation on the oral mucosa and surrounding skin of the mouth and lips.  After resolution of the initial infection, the virus enters a latent phase where viral particles lay dormant in neural sensory ganglia (most commonly the trigeminal). $#Reactivation# of the virus occurs during times of stress or illness, resulting in recurrence of the characteristic perioral vesicular lesions.  During reactivation, HSV particles rely on #anterograde axonal transport# to reach the skin and oral mucosa.  Anterograde axonal transport is mediated by #kinesin#, a motor protein that moves intracellular cargo (eg, organelles, viral particles) away from the nucleus, down the axon, and toward the nerve terminal.  Kinesin-mediated movement is powered by ATP hydrolysis and guided by microtubule filaments, which function as an intracellular \"track\" system. $#(Choice A)#  Dynein is a microtubular motor protein that participates in retrograde axonal transport (ie, moving organelles toward the nucleus).  Dynein is important in establishing the latent phase following primary HSV infection by transporting viral particles to the neural sensory ganglia.  However, it is not responsible for disease recurrence. $#(Choice C)#  Lamins are proteins that help form the fibrillar network that lines the inside of the nuclear envelope.  In addition to providing structural support, they also help to organize the genome and regulate gene transcription. $#(Choice D)#  Selectins are a group of cell adhesion molecules that are expressed on endothelial cells during the inflammatory response.  They function to bind leukocytes, allowing them to exit blood vessels at the site of inflammation. $#(Choice E)#  Spectrin is a cytoskeletal protein located intracellularly along the plasma membrane.  It is responsible for maintaining the distinct shape of red blood cells.  Protein defects may result in hereditary elliptocytosis and spherocytosis. $#(Choice F)#  Vimentin is a type of intermediate filament expressed in mesenchymal cells.  It is responsible for securing organelles inside the cytosol and provides resistance to mechanical stress. $#Educational objective# Kinesin is a microtubule-associated motor protein that functions in the anterograde transport of materials and organelles within cells.

Focal dystonias are due to abnormal #neural signaling pathways#, which can arise from multiple locations in the brain (eg, basal ganglia, motor cortex, supplementary motor areas). $Because the dystonia originates from abnormal neural signaling, microscopic examination of the affected muscle is often relatively unremarkable.  Histopathology may show normal muscle or #muscle fiber hypertrophy# (which occurs due to repetitive contractions). $#(Choice A)#  Certain types of glycogen storage diseases (eg, Pompe disease) can lead to weakness and fatigue due to abnormal glycogenolysis in skeletal muscle.
