    "explanation_2": "$ This patient has @clinical features@ of #Marfan syndrome#, an autosomal dominant disorder caused by #mutations# in the FBN1 gene encoding #fibrillin-1#, a main component of extracellular matrix microfibrils.  Fibrillin-1 provides support to elastic fibers and helps maintain connective tissue integrity.  It also regulates extracellular matrix remodelling by binding to and sequestering #transforming growth factor-beta# (TGF-beta). $ In Marfan syndrome, defective fibrillin-1 is unable to bind TGF-beta.  The resulting #overexpression# of free, active TGF-beta leads to increased production of matrix metalloproteinases, which cleave elastic fibers and other components of the extracellular matrix, #reducing tissue integrity#.  Within the mitral valve, this process results in fragmentation of elastic fibers and decreased collagen density with pooling of glycosaminoglycans (#myxomatous mitral degeneration#). $ The elongated, floppy mitral valve leaflets #prolapse# into the atrium, which causes a midsystolic click on auscultation and allows for @mitral valve regurgitation@.  This regurgitant flow is characterized by a #mid-to-late systolic apical murmur#, as seen in this patient; severe regurgitation may produce a holosystolic murmur. $ (Choice A)  Although aortic root dilation is common with Marfan syndrome, the associated aortic regurgitation causes a decrescendo diastolic murmur. $ (Choice B)  Aortic valve cusp fusion (ie, bicuspid aortic valve) is commonly associated with @Turner syndrome@, not Marfan syndrome.  Auscultatory findings are attributed to aortic stenosis (systolic crescendo-decrescendo murmur at the right upper sternal border) and/or aortic regurgitation (diastolic murmur along the left sternal border). $ (Choice C)  Endocardial fibrous deposition occurs with carcinoid heart disease.  In contrast to this case, presentation includes right-sided heart failure (eg, edema, hepatomegaly), and common murmurs include tricuspid regurgitation (ie, holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border) and pulmonic regurgitation (ie, diastolic decrescendo murmur). $ (Choice E)  Papillary muscle dysfunction, which is typically the result of myocardial ischemia/infarction, can cause mitral regurgitation (ie, holosystolic murmur).  Marfan syndrome is not associated with papillary muscle dysfunction. $ Educational objective Marfan syndrome is a connective tissue disorder in which defective fibrillin-1 decreases tissue integrity and increases expression of transforming growth factor-beta.  Cardiac effects include myxomatous degeneration and prolapse of the mitral valve with associated regurgitation, which manifests as a midsystolic click and mid-to-late systolic murmur.",

    "explanation_2": "$#Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm# (AAA) is a surgical emergency involving full-thickness compromise of the aortic wall with extravasation of blood into surrounding tissues and spaces.  The #acute onset# of #severe abdominal and back pain# is the most common presenting symptom.  In general, anterior rupture into the #peritoneal cavity# is quickly accompanied by #syncope#, hypotension, and shock, whereas posterior rupture into the retroperitoneum may be temporarily contained, resulting in delayed onset of hemodynamic instability.  Other signs suggesting AAA rupture include abdominal distension, a pulsatile abdominal mass, and umbilical or flank hematoma (indicators of retroperitoneal hemorrhage). $ Early detection of AAA can be difficult because patients frequently have few symptoms until the AAA either ruptures or markedly expands.  Therefore, ruptured AAA should be suspected in patients with consistent symptoms and known #risk factors#, which include advanced age (>60), #smoking#, male sex, and a history of atherosclerosis or connective tissue disease.  @CT imaging@ can confirm the diagnosis, but hemodynamically unstable patients with suspected ruptured AAA should go straight to emergent surgical repair. $ (Choice A)  Acute mesenteric ischemia has similar risk factors to AAA.  Patients typically describe severe abdominal pain but have few findings on physical examination (eg, minimal tenderness)  and hypotension and syncope are not usually seen. $(Choice B)  Colonic perforation can be due to diverticulitis, malignancy, or complications from colonoscopy.  Patients can develop hypotension due to sepsis, but signs of infection (eg, fever) and peritonitis (eg, rebound, guarding) are also expected. $ (Choice C)  Renal colic is characterized by episodic (eg, every 30 min) flank or groin pain due to capsular stretch from nephrolithiasis-associated obstruction.  Hypotension and syncope are not typical features. $ (Choice E)  Vertebral compression fractures can cause acute back pain exacerbated by minimal movement (eg, coughing, bending).  Although the pain can occasionally refer to the abdomen, it is most commonly at the midline over the spinous processes.  There should not be associated hypotension. $ Educational objective Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm is a surgical emergency that usually presents with the acute onset of severe abdominal and back pain in patients with appropriate risk factors (eg, advanced age, smoking, atherosclerosis).

    "explanation_2": "$This patient's presentation is most consistent with aortic dissection, which is characterized by severe retrosternal chest pain radiating to the mid-to-upper back that can move downward as the dissection progresses.  It is initiated by a #tear in the aortic intima# that typically extends for about 1-5 cm in a transverse or oblique direction.  The dissection can progress both proximally and distally as blood is forced through the tear, bisecting through the aortic media.  Dissections involving any portion of the ascending aorta are classified as type A; those confined to the descending aorta are classified as type B.  As the dissecting intramural hematoma spreads along the aortic wall, it can compress major arterial branches.  This patient's brachial #blood pressure discrepancy# suggests compromise of the brachiocephalic trunk servicing his right arm. $ #Hypertension# is the primary risk factor for aortic dissection.  In many patients with longstanding hypertension, there is medial hypertrophy of the aortic vasa vasorum and, consequently, reduced blood flow to the aortic media.  This can cause medial degeneration with a loss of smooth muscle cells, leading to aortic enlargement and increased wall stiffness.  Both of these changes exacerbate aortic wall stress, which is already increased due to the hypertension itself.  This synergistic increase in aortic wall stress greatly increases the risk of intimal tearing and subsequent development of aortic dissection. $ (Choice A)  An intimal fatty streak is the initial lesion of atherosclerosis.  Some fatty streaks progress to frank atheromas, which can progressively weaken the underlying media of the aortic wall.  However, atherosclerosis predisposes more to aortic aneurysm formation than to aortic dissection. $ (Choice C)  Monckeberg sclerosis (@medial calcific sclerosis@) is a form of arteriosclerosis characterized by calcific deposits in the medial layer of muscular arteries.  These lesions generally occur in patients age >50 and are thought to cause isolated systolic hypertension due to arterial hardening. $ #(Choices D and E)#  Aortitis with medial inflammation can be caused by autoimmune conditions such as Takayasu and giant cell arteritis.  #Tertiary syphilis# can also cause a form of aortitis characterized by #obliterative endarteritis# of the vasa vasorum.  These conditions weaken the aortic wall and can predispose to aortic aneurysms and, rarely, dissections.  However, hypertension is a more important risk factor for the development of intimal tearing, the primary triggering event of an aortic dissection. $ Educational objective Aortic dissection classically presents with severe retrosternal pain that radiates to the back.  This condition develops when overwhelming hemodynamic stress leads to tearing of the aortic intima with blood subsequently dissecting through the aortic media.  The resulting intramural hematoma can extend both proximally and distally and can compress major arterial branches and impair blood flow.",

    "explanation_2": "$@Click here for posterior view@.$This patient presents with symptoms and ECG findings consistent with transmural ischemic injury to the inferior wall of the heart.  In 90% of individuals, the posteroinferior wall of the left ventricle is supplied by the posterior descending branch of the right coronary artery (RCA).  The patient's bradycardia and resultant hypotension suggests that there may have been ischemic injury to the sinus node as well.  (The sinus node normally receives its arterial blood supply from the RCA.) $ #(Choices A, B, and C)#  The left main coronary artery gives rise to the left anterior descending (LAD) and the left circumflex (LCX) coronary arteries.  The LAD supplies the interventricular septum and the anterior wall of the left ventricle.  Transmural ischemia of the septum would produce ST elevation mainly in leads V1 and V2.  Infranodal (Mobitz type II) second-degree or third-degree heart block is a possible result as well; but sinus bradycardia would not occur with this type of injury.  Transmural ischemia of the anterior left ventricular wall would produce ST elevations mainly in leads V3 and V4.  An occlusion of the proximal LAD would cause anteroseptal transmural ischemia, with ST elevations in leads V1–V4. $ The LCX supplies the lateral wall of the left ventricle.  Transmural ischemia secondary to LCX occlusion would produce ST elevations mainly in leads V5 and V6, and possibly also in leads I and aVL.  An occlusion of the left main coronary artery would therefore be expected to produce widespread transmural ischemia of the interventricular septum and left ventricle, with ST elevations in all of the chest (V) leads, and possibly also in leads I and aVL. $ (Choice E)  Intramural arteries in the substance of the myocardium are unlikely sites of occlusion because, unlike the epicardial coronary arteries, they are rarely affected by atherosclerosis.  Moreover, if occlusion of intramural arteries did occur, subendocardial ischemia (with associated ST depression) would be more likely than transmural ischemia (with ST elevation). $ Educational Objective In 90% of individuals, occlusion of the right coronary artery can result in transmural ischemia of the inferior wall of the left ventricle, producing ST elevation in leads II, III, and aVF as well as possible sinus node dysfunction.  Occlusion of the proximal LAD would be expected to result in anteroseptal transmural ischemia, with ST elevations in leads V1–V4.  Occlusion of the LCX would produce transmural ischemia of the lateral wall of the left ventricle, with ST elevations mainly in V5 and V6, and possibly also in I and aVL.",

Autopsy findings reveal #uniformly thickened# left ventricular (LV) walls and a small LV cavity, which are consistent with concentric LV hypertrophy. $ @Concentric LV hypertrophy@ most commonly results from prolonged #systemic hypertension# as myocardial fibers are added in parallel to increase contractile strength and handle the increased pressure load.  As concentric hypertrophy worsens, it can manifest clinically as #hypertensive heart disease#, consisting of #impaired diastolic filling# and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.  The elevated diastolic filling pressures are transmitted back to the left atrium, causing atrial dilation and altered conduction that predisposes to #atrial fibrillation#.

The increased myocardial mass may be inadequately supplied with oxygen, contributing to cellular necrosis and interstitial fibrosis. $ (Choice A)  Cardiac amyloidosis involves deposition of abnormal proteins in the myocardium and can lead to restrictive cardiomyopathy, which is characterized by impaired diastolic filling due to stiffening, rather than thickening, of the ventricular walls.

The elevated pressure load on the right ventricle can lead to concentric right ventricular hypertrophy and right-sided heart failure.  Pulmonary edema is not present in right-sided heart failure. $ Educational objective Concentric left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy involves uniform thickening of the LV walls with reduction in LV cavity size and most commonly results from prolonged systemic hypertension.

Hemodynamic monitoring (eg, pulmonary artery catheterization) shows #decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP)# and #increased right atrial pressure (RAP)#, which indicate impaired blood flow from the right ventricle to the left side of the heart #(right-sided heart failure)#.  Common causes of right-sided heart failure include obstruction of pulmonary circulation (eg, pulmonary arterial hypertension, pulmonary embolism) and #right ventricular infarction# (likely in this patient due to multiple cardiovascular risk factors). $ In right ventricular infarction, the right ventricle is unable to effectively pump blood forward into the pulmonary arteries, causing increased pressure in the right atrium (ie, elevated central venous pressure).  The decreased right ventricular outflow also lowers PCWP (an indicator of left-sided preload), which subsequently reduces cardiac output and causes hypotension.  A reflexive increase in heart rate is mostly intact in this patient, though it is often impaired in right ventricular infarction due to frequent ischemic involvement of the conduction system. $ #(Choices A and D)#  Anaphylactic shock and @septic shock@ are associated with peripheral vasodilation and massive fluid shift to the extravascular space.  The depleted intravascular volume lowers the mean circulatory filling pressure, reducing both RAP and PCWP, while hypotension caused by widespread peripheral vasodilation leads to a compensatory increase in cardiac output. $ (Choice B)  Gastrointestinal bleeding can cause @hypovolemic shock@ with decreased RAP, PCWP, and cardiac output.  Decreased cardiac output triggers an increase in sympathetic tone with peripheral vasoconstriction (increased systemic vascular resistance) to help maintain perfusion pressure. $ (Choice E)  Aortic stenosis causes left ventricular outflow obstruction and would increase pressure in the left atrium (increased PCWP) and pulmonary circulation.  In severe cases, right-sided heart failure can also develop, leading to increased RAP.  Systemic vascular resistance is increased with aortic stenosis in response to a reduction in cardiac output. $ Educational objective Right ventricular infarction (right-sided heart failure) can lead to shock via impaired forward blood flow to the left heart, which lowers left-sided preload (decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure) and decreases cardiac output.

    "explanation_2": "This patient had #subacute infective endocarditis (IE)# complicated by an #embolic stroke#.  The large, friable irregular masses seen on autopsy are most likely vegetations and are the most probable source of this patient's left middle cerebral artery embolus (eg, right-sided weakness, speech difficulty). $ The mitral valve is the valve most frequently affected by IE.  #Mitral valve prolapse (MVP)# is the most common underlying valvular disease predisposing to the development of IE in #developed countries#, particularly when it is associated with coexistent #mitral regurgitation#.  Microscopic deposits of platelets and fibrin occur spontaneously in individuals with valvular disease secondary to endocardial injury from turbulent blood flow.  These deposits then become colonized by microorganisms (eg, viridans streptococci) during episodes of bacteremia (eg, following dental extraction). $ In #developing countries#, the most common acquired heart disease leading to IE development is #rheumatic heart disease# (RHD).  RHD is a late (10-20 years) complication of acute rheumatic fever (eg, migratory arthritis, carditis/valvulitis, erythema marginatum).  RHD was historically considered a frequent predisposing factor for IE; however, MVP, valvular sclerosis, and mechanical valves are now more common causes in developed nations due to the recognition and treatment of group A streptococcal pharyngitis. $ (Choice A)  Congenital heart lesions that predispose to increased risk of IE include bicuspid aortic valve, ventricular septal defects, patent ductus arteriosus, and unrepaired tetralogy of Fallot.  Isolated atrial septal defects are not commonly associated with an increased risk of IE, likely due to the low-pressure differential between the atria and the absence of high-velocity intracardiac flow jets that can damage the endocardium. $ (Choice B)  Coronary heart disease can cause ischemic papillary muscle dysfunction with resultant mitral regurgitation.  However, the clinical presentation and autopsy findings in this patient are most consistent with MVP and IE. $ (Choice C)  IE is a rare complication of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and is almost always seen in patients with outflow obstruction.  @Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy@ is characterized by asymmetric ventricular hypertrophy leading to reduced left ventricular cavity size. $ (Choice D)  Mitral annular calcification refers to degeneration and progressive calcium deposition involving the fibrous annulus of the mitral valve.  Mitral annular calcification is usually seen in older adults (age >60), and the annulus is not a common location for IE. $ Educational objective Mitral valve prolapse with regurgitation is the most common predisposing condition for native valve infective endocarditis (IE) in developed nations.  Rheumatic heart disease remains a frequent cause of IE in developing nations.",

A primary insult to the myocardium leads to impaired myocardial contractile function with dilation of one or both ventricles.  The structural changes to the ventricular myocardium places these patients at risk of #sudden cardiac death# from ventricular arrhythmia (ie, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation).  In addition, the global hypokinesis of the left ventricle leads to stagnation of blood flow and the possible development of LV mural thrombus and subsequent systemic embolization. $ Causes of DCM include infection (eg, viral myocarditis, Chagas disease), chemical toxicity (eg, alcohol), and inherited disease.  The premature death of this patient's father from a heart problem suggests #familial DCM#, which is typically transmitted in an #autosomal dominant# inheritance pattern.  Truncating mutations affecting the #TTN gene#, which encodes for the cardiac @sarcomere protein@ #titin#, are the most common cause of familial DCM. $ (Choice A)  Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is an autoimmune disorder characterized by venous and/or arterial thrombosis.  Cardiac manifestations can include valvular thickening, nonbacterial vegetations, and increased risk of coronary atherosclerosis; however, LV cavity enlargement and mural thrombus are not typical. $ (Choice C)  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by mutation in genes encoding for one of several cardiac sarcomere proteins (eg, beta-myosin heavy chain, myosin-binding protein C).  It is a common cause of sudden cardiac death in young individuals, usually during exertion.  Autopsy typically shows asymmetric septal hypertrophy of the left ventricle. $ (Choice D)  Ischemic heart disease can lead to myocardial dysfunction and LV enlargement that mimics DCM; however, this patient's coronary arteries had only minor atherosclerotic narrowing (ie, 20% and 25%) that would not have caused clinically significant myocardial ischemia. $ (Choice E)  Restrictive cardiomyopathy is typically the early cardiac manifestation of an infiltrative process (eg, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis) and is characterized by nondilated ventricles with enlargement of both atria. $ Educational objective Dilated cardiomyopathy results from primary myocardial dysfunction leading to eccentric remodeling of the left ventricle.

Hypertensive emergencies typically occur in patients with preexisting essential hypertension and may be induced by medication noncompliance, which can result in a rapid increase in systemic blood pressure.  Severe hypertension can cause damage to the vascular endothelium, leading to increased vascular permeability to coagulation factors (eg, fibrinogen), platelet activation, and endothelial cell death.  In the kidney, this manifests as #malignant nephrosclerosis#, which is characterized by 2 distinct histopathologic patterns: $ • #Fibrinoid necrosis:#  Cell death and excessive fibrin deposition within the arteriolar walls is visible as circumferential, amorphous, pink material with smudged, necrotic endothelial cells that lack cytologic detail. $ •  #Hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis:#  Over time, activated platelets and injured endothelial cells release growth factors, which induce concentric hyperplasia and layering of smooth muscle cells and collagen, resulting in intimal thickening and an '@onion-skin@' appearance. $ These changes result in narrowing and/or obliteration of the arteriolar lumen; the resultant erythrocyte fragmentation and platelet consumption can cause a #microangiopathic hemolytic anemia# that is histologically indistinguishable from hemolytic uremic syndrome.  Laboratory abnormalities reflect renal injury (eg, elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen) and hemolytic anemia (eg, schistocytes [fragmented red blood cells] on peripheral smear, elevated lactate dehydrogenase and indirect bilirubin). $ Other end-organ manifestations of hypertensive emergency include papilledema, retinal hemorrhages, pulmonary edema, acute coronary syndrome, encephalopathy, and stroke. $ #(Choices B, D, and E)#  Hypertensive nephrosclerosis (ie, long-term essential hypertension) is characterized by interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, and varying degrees of glomerulosclerosis (eg, focal or global).  @Hyaline arteriolosclerosis@ is characterized by deposition of hyaline (glassy, homogenous) material in the intima and media of small arteries and arterioles.  These changes may be seen in chronic hypertension; however, the severely elevated blood pressure and evidence of end-organ dysfunction in this patient are indicative of acute hypertensive emergency and malignant nephrosclerosis. $ (Choice C)  Granulomatous inflammation of the media characterizes @temporal (giant cell) arteritis@, the most common form of systemic vasculitis in adults. $ Educational objective Hypertensive emergency is severely elevated blood pressure (typically >180/120 mm Hg) with evidence of end-organ damage.

Accompanying #impotence# and/or #gluteal claudication# suggests more proximal #aortoiliac occlusion# (so-called @Leriche syndrome@), which, in addition to affecting the external iliac artery, also diminishes blood flow to the internal pudendal and gluteal branches of the internal iliac artery. $ (Choice A)  Granulomatous inflammation of the arterial media occurs in @temporal (giant cell) arteritis@, the most common form of systemic vasculitis in adults.

The endothelium lining the aortic side of the aortic valve cusps is exposed to the same high pressure and turbulent blood flow as the aortic vascular endothelium.  As occurs with @atheroma development@ in the vascular endothelium, these mechanical forces (along with smoking, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia) over time cause damage to the #aortic valve cusp endothelium#, triggering #endothelial dysfunction# and the onset of a similar atherosclerotic process.  There is subendothelial lipid deposition and infiltration of inflammatory cells (ie, macrophages, T lymphocytes) followed by the release of inflammatory mediators (eg, interleukin-1-beta, transforming growth factor beta-1). $ Subsequently, there is increased production of proteins involved in tissue calcification (eg, osteopontin).

The likelihood of plaque rupture is typically related to plaque stability rather than plaque size or degree of luminal narrowing.  Plaque stability largely depends on the mechanical strength of the fibrous cap:  Thin-cap fibroatheromas are generally unstable and more vulnerable to rupture. $ During the chronic inflammatory progression of an atheroma, the fibrous cap is continually being remodeled.  The balance of collagen synthesis and degradation determines the mechanical strength of the cap.  #Thin-cap fibroatheromas# are characterized by a large necrotic core covered by a thin fibrous cap.  Activated macrophages infiltrating the atheroma contribute to the breakdown of extracellular matrix proteins (eg, collagen) by secreting #metalloproteinases#.  Ongoing intimal inflammation can destabilize the mechanical integrity of the plaque through release of these metalloproteinases, resulting in plaque rupture and consequent acute coronary syndrome. $ (Choice A)  Hydroxymethylglutaryl (HMG) CoA reductase is the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis and is mostly expressed in the liver, intestine, adrenal cortex, and reproductive tissues.  Patients with hyperlipidemia are typically treated with statins (eg, atorvastatin), which competitively inhibit HMG CoA reductase. $ (Choice B)  Lysyl oxidase strengthens extracellular collagen fibers by mediating cross-link formation between lysine and hydroxylysine residues (requires copper).  Therefore, a high activity of lysyl oxidase would favor atheroma stabilization by strengthening collagen in the fibrous cap. $ (Choice D)  Procollagen peptidase cleaves the terminal regions of procollagen molecules exocytosed by fibroblasts or smooth muscle cells, transforming procollagen into insoluble tropocollagen.  Tropocollagen then aggregates to form collagen fibrils. $ (Choice E)  Prolyl hydroxylase is responsible for the hydroxylation of proline on procollagen chains (requires vitamin C), which is a necessary step in the formation of a stable collagen triple helix. $ Educational objective The likelihood of plaque rupture is related to plaque stability rather than plaque size or the degree of luminal narrowing.  Plaque stability largely depends on the mechanical strength of the fibrous cap.

Dissections can affect the ascending aorta (@type A@) or may involve only the descending aorta (type B).  The most common symptom is sharp or tearing #chest and back pain# that is severe and sudden.  If an ascending dissection extends proximally to the aortic root, it can affect the coronary ostia or aortic valve, resulting in myocardial ischemia or aortic regurgitation, respectively.  Other signs and symptoms include #blood pressure asymmetry#, stroke, or paraplegia, depending on the @vessels and structures@ involved (eg, subclavian artery, carotid artery, spinal arteries). $ In addition, a dissection may extend proximally into the #pericardium#, causing blood to fill the pericardial space and leading to acute tamponade.

Signs of tamponade include jugular venous distension, muffled heart sounds, and hypotension (Beck triad), as well as reduced point of maximal impulse, cool extremities, and clear lungs. $ (Choice A)  Air in the pleural space is expected with tension pneumothorax, which can cause obstructive shock due to mediastinal shifting with vena cava collapse and impaired venous return to the heart.  Although sudden-onset chest pain is common, shortness of breath and unilaterally absent breath sounds are expected. $ (Choice C)  A ruptured posteromedial papillary muscle causes acute mitral regurgitation, which can abruptly lead to cardiogenic shock.  Patients are expected to have shortness of breath and lung crackles due to acute pulmonary edema. $ (Choice D)  A saddle pulmonary thromboembolism can cause obstructive shock with right ventricular failure and jugular venous distension.

Stable angina is characterized by substernal or left-sided chest pressure, tightness, or pain that is reliably produced by exertion and relieved by rest.  It occurs due to temporary myocardial ischemia resulting from #demand-supply mismatch# of oxygen-rich blood to the myocardium. $ Myocardial oxygen demand is determined by heart rate, blood pressure (afterload), left-ventricular end-diastolic volume (preload), and cardiac contractility, whereas myocardial oxygen supply is determined by coronary blood flow.

Although most cases are associated with normal ventricular wall thickness, infiltrative conditions such as cardiac amyloidosis may lead to significant #ventricular hypertrophy#.  Infiltrative diseases can also cause conduction system abnormalities (eg, bradycardia) that may ultimately require pacemaker implantation. $ #Cardiac amyloidosis# results from abnormal extracellular deposition of insoluble proteins such as monoclonal light chains (AL amyloidosis), mutated transthyretin (familial ATTR amyloidosis), or wild-type transthyretin (senile systemic amyloidosis) in myocardial tissue.

Microscopic examination of the myocardium reveals the presence of noncaseating granulomas containing giant cells. $ (Choice C)  @Chagas disease@ occurs secondary to Trypanosoma cruzi infection and is a common cause of myopericarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy in Latin America.  Microscopic examination typically shows multiple parasitic protozoa within the myocardial fibers with a dense cellular infiltrate and myofiber destruction. $ (Choice D)  @Hemochromatosis@ leads to excessive iron deposition in the myocardium and can cause conduction abnormalities and restrictive or dilated cardiomyopathy.  Endomyocardial biopsy typically reveals excessive iron deposition in the myocardium, which can be confirmed with Prussian blue staining. $ Educational objective Restrictive cardiomyopathy can be caused by infiltrative diseases (eg, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis) and often results in diastolic heart failure due to ventricular hypertrophy with impaired ventricular filling.

This patient's Lichtenberg figures (erythematous cutaneous marks in a fern-leaf pattern) and second-degree burns confirm the suspicion.  Although lightning injuries are rare, they are associated with a 25% fatality rate, and more than 70% of survivors have long-lasting complications.  Two-thirds of lightning-related deaths occur within the first hour following injury; the most common causes are fatal arrhythmias and respiratory failure.  A comprehensive and thorough physical examination should always be performed on lightning strike victims as injury patterns are widely variable and skin findings can significantly underestimate the extent of internal injury. $ (Choice B)  Superficial burns are common in lightning injury.  In contrast, deep-tissue burns are relatively rare due to the short duration of electrical contact and the 'flashover effect,' the tendency of lightning to travel over the skin surface and discharge to the ground.  This effect is responsible for the formation of Lichtenberg figures. $ (Choice C)  Intracranial hemorrhage only rarely occurs following lightning injury.  Lightning strikes can damage the autonomic system and cause fixed and dilated or asymmetric pupils.  These signs may not accurately reflect the extent of neurologic injury and should not be a reason to stop resuscitation. $ #(Choices D and E)#  Lightning induces rapid heating of the surrounding air, generating shock waves that can travel through the body and cause mechanical trauma.

Carcinoids are well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors found most commonly in the distal small intestine and proximal colon, with a strong propensity for metastasis to the liver.  These tumors secrete several products (including histamine, serotonin, and vasoactive intestinal peptide) that are metabolized in the liver.  In patients with liver metastasis, these hormones are released directly into the systemic circulation, leading to carcinoid syndrome. $ Carcinoid heart disease is caused by excessive secretion of #serotonin#, which stimulates fibroblast growth and fibrogenesis.

This septum is composed of muscular and membranous portions; failed fusion of any of its derivative parts results in @VSD@.  The associated murmur #may not be audible immediately# after birth due to high pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) that limits left-to-right shunting through the VSD; it typically develops over the ensuing days as PVR declines (as in this case). $ • #Small VSDs# are typically asymptomatic due to the small volume of shunted blood, but turbulent flow through this narrow connection causes a #harsh, holosystolic murmur# at the left-mid to left-lower sternal border.  Unlike larger defects, small VSDs usually undergo spontaneous closure. $ • #Moderate to large VSDs# lead to pulmonary overcirculation and @left-sided volume overload@ that can cause #heart failure# (eg, diaphoresis, failure to thrive); larger shunts increase the risk.  Because of relatively unrestricted flow compared to smaller defects, auscultation typically demonstrates a softer or no murmur.

The characteristic systolic ejection murmur best heard over the second intercostal space is caused by right-sided volume overload and increased flow across the pulmonic valve. $ (Choice C)  Patent ductus arteriosus (@PDA@) occurs due to failed obliteration of the vascular connection between the pulmonary artery and aorta and allows left-to-right shunting.  Like VSD, a PDA murmur typically increases in intensity as PVR declines following birth; the continuous murmur is best heard at the left upper sternal border. $ (Choice E)  Malalignment of the infundibular septum can cause varying degrees of right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) obstruction, as in @tetralogy of Fallot@.  Patients typically have a large VSD and a murmur created by flow through the partially obstructed RVOT (crescendo-decrescendo murmur best heard along the left mid to upper sternal border). $ Educational objective Ventricular septal defect occurs due to insufficient development of the interventricular septum and commonly presents with a holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border as pulmonary vascular resistance declines in the neonatal period.

There is often a latency period of 10-20 years between the initial episode of rheumatic fever and symptomatic MS, with most patients manifesting during the fourth or fifth decade of life. $ Mitral stenosis can cause atrial enlargement, which may lead to #atrial fibrillation# and/or atrial #mural thromboses#.  Thrombi dislodged from the wall of the left atrium may later cause an embolic stroke, which likely occurred in this patient.  Cardiac auscultation in #mitral stenosis# often reveals a loud first heart sound (S1), an early diastolic sound (opening snap), followed by a #mid-diastolic murmur# from turbulent flow across the mitral valve. $ (Choice A)  Congenital endocardial cushion defects can result in mitral regurgitation.  However, congenital mitral valve stenosis is rare and untreated newborns and infants typically have a grim prognosis. $ (Choice B)  Degenerative calcific deposits most commonly develop in the mitral valve annulus in women over age 60 and generally do not impair valve function.  This patient's autopsy did not show any peripherally located nodular calcific deposits. $ (Choice C)  Embolization of vegetations due to infective endocarditis can cause a stroke or septic infarct resulting in a brain abscess.  However, infective endocarditis is usually associated with large friable vegetations on the valve cusps along with destruction (rather than fibrosis) of the valve leaflets. $ (Choice D)  Tertiary syphilis may result in aortitis, aortic aneurysm, and/or aortic regurgitation.  Mitral valve lesions are not commonly observed. $ (Choice F)  Although cardiac involvement is uncommon in rheumatoid arthritis, patients can develop pericarditis and myocarditis.  Rheumatoid nodules can also develop in the cardiac tissues (including valvular structures), but these are rarely symptomatic. $ (Choice G)  Rupture of papillary muscle (whether due to bacterial endocarditis, a connective tissue disease, or myocardial infarction) leads to prolapse of the valve leaflets and mitral regurgitation (holosystolic or early systolic murmur). $ Educational objective Rheumatic mitral stenosis is characterized by diffuse fibrous thickening and distortion of the mitral valve leaflets along with commissural fusion at the leaflet edges.

Despite a family history of CAD, myocardial infarction is relatively unlikely in this man age <40. $ (Choice C)  Gram-positive cocci (eg, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae) in rare cases can cause pericarditis (purulent pericarditis) via direct extension of pneumonia or hematogenous bacterial spread.  Affected patients are typically quite ill and present with high fever and sepsis. $ (Choice D)  Malignant pericarditis can occur in the setting of metastatic cancer (eg, lung cancer, breast cancer); however, it is less likely to present with pain and inflammation and more likely to present with symptoms of fluid accumulation (ie, dyspnea due to subacute cardiac tamponade).  Malignant pericarditis is also relatively uncommon compared to viral pericarditis and less likely in this relatively young man. $ Educational objective Viral infection is the most common cause of acute pericarditis.

Inflammatory cells (particularly macrophages) release matrix metalloproteinases and elastases that degrade extracellular matrix components (eg, elastin, collagen), leading to weakening and #progressive expansion# of the aortic wall.  Furthermore, ischemia of the tunica media may play a role as the infrarenal abdominal aorta has a tenuous vasa vasorum, and atherosclerotic thickening of the intimal layer increases the diffusion distance for oxygen. $ (Choice B)  Cystic medial necrosis is characterized by loss of smooth muscle, collagen, and elastic tissue with formation of cystic mucoid spaces in the aortic media.

However, thiazides, especially in higher doses, can cause a variety of metabolic complications, including hypercalcemia, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hyponatremia, and hypokalemia.  The incidence of the individual side effects is relatively low, and, patients rarely experience all of the potential adverse effects. $ Thiazides increase renal Ca2+ reabsorption, leading to #hypercalcemia# and #hypocalciuria#.  This occurs through 2 major mechanisms: $ 1. Thiazides #inhibit the Na+/Cl− cotransporter# on the apical side of distal convoluted tubule cells, which decreases intracellular Na+ concentration.  This activates the basolateral #Na+/Ca2+ antiporter#, which pumps Na+ into the cell in exchange for Ca2+.  The resulting decrease in intracellular Ca2+ enhances luminal Ca2+ reabsorption across the apical membrane. $ 2. #Hypovolemia# induced by thiazides increases Na+ and H2O reabsorption in the proximal tubule, leading to a passive increase in paracellular Ca2+ reabsorption. $ The increase in circulating calcium suppresses parathyroid hormone (PTH) release, leading to a new steady state with a mildly elevated serum calcium concentration and low serum PTH. $ (Choice A)  Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is a benign disorder caused by mutations in the calcium-sensing receptor in the parathyroid gland and kidneys.  Higher calcium levels are required to suppress secretion of PTH, leading to mild hypercalcemia and hypocalciuria.  However, unlike in patients taking thiazide diuretics, PTH is high-normal or mildly elevated. $ (Choice B)  Hyperthyroidism can cause hypercalcemia due to increased osteoclastic bone resorption, but serum calcium in hypothyroidism is usually normal. $ #(Choices D and E)# Primary hyperparathyroidism is caused by parathyroid hyperplasia or adenoma; it is characterized by hypercalcemia with elevated or inappropriately normal PTH levels.  Secondary hyperparathyroidism is usually seen in patients with chronic kidney disease and is due to phosphate retention and decreased production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D; these disturbances lead to decreased intestinal calcium absorption, hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and a compensatory increase in PTH secretion.  This patient has a decreased PTH level. $Educational objective Thiazide diuretics cause hypercalcemia by increasing the distal tubular reabsorption of Ca2+.  The increased circulating calcium levels result in suppression of parathyroid hormone, which distinguishes this effect from hyperparathyroidism."

    "explanation_2": "$The presence of a #midsystolic click# followed by a systolic murmur at the cardiac apex that disappears with squatting is most consistent with @mitral valve prolapse@ (MVP).  The click is caused by sudden tensing of the chordae tendineae as they are pulled taut by the ballooning valve leaflets, and the murmur results from regurgitation of blood due to malalignment of the valve margins with prolapse. $ During systole, there is a critical left ventricular (LV) size at which prolapse occurs; therefore, @maneuvers@ that change LV end-diastolic volume affect the timing of the click and murmur. #Squatting increases venous return# and #LV volume#, increasing the tension and #decreasing the slack# in the mitral valve apparatus.  Because the ventricular walls have farther to travel to reach the critical LV size at which prolapse occurs, #prolapse occurs later# in systole or not at all. $ Primary MVP is most commonly a sporadic disorder and is characterized by myxomatous degeneration (ie, pathologic #deterioration of the connective tissue#) affecting the mitral valve leaflets and chordae tendineae.  Secondary MVP is associated with inherited connective tissue disorders, including Marfan or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and osteogenesis imperfecta. $ (Choice A)  @Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy@ (HCM) presents with a systolic murmur at the left sternal border that decreases in intensity with squatting (due to increased LV volume and decreased outflow tract obstruction).  A midsystolic click is not heard with HCM. $ (Choice C)  Coronary artery disease can cause myocardial ischemia or infarction leading to papillary muscle dysfunction and acute mitral regurgitation.

In addition, such a murmur is not preceded by a midsystolic click. $ (Choice D)  Endomyocardial fibrosis and endocardial fibroelastosis are disorders that affect the endocardium and are not associated with MVP. $ (Choice E)  Pericardial disease may infrequently result in cardiac tamponade or constrictive pericarditis.  Pericarditis may produce a friction rub; however, it is not associated with a cardiac murmur. $ Educational objective Mitral valve prolapse is most often caused by defects in connective tissue proteins that predispose to myxomatous degeneration of the mitral leaflets and chordae tendineae.  Cardiac auscultation typically reveals a midsystolic click followed by a mitral regurgitation murmur; the click and murmur occur later in systole or disappear completely with maneuvers (eg, squatting) that increase left ventricular end-diastolic volume.",

In this patient, the #slow development# of a #stable atherosclerotic plaque# in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) likely allowed collateral vessels from the right coronary artery to supply the ischemic myocardium located distal to the LAD occlusion.  Because there is low hydrostatic pressure distal to the LAD occlusion, a pressure gradient is created that facilitates blood flow through the small collateral vessels. $  An @unstable atherosclerotic plaque@ is less likely to allow the development of viable collateral vessels, as it is more likely to rupture before it becomes large enough to cause significant chronic ischemia; rupture leads to overlying thrombus and #abrupt arterial occlusion# with acute myocardial ischemia/#infarction# and cellular necrosis.  The rapid development of ischemia allows insufficient time for collateral vessels to develop and mature. $ #(Choices A, B, and F)# Atherosclerotic plaques with active inflammation (containing activated macrophages that secrete metalloproteinases and degrade collagen), high core concentration of lipids, and/or a thin fibrous cap are unstable and more likely to rupture.  All of these properties are less likely in an atherosclerotic lesion that has grown to create near-total occlusion without rupturing. $ (Choice C)  A patient's total coronary artery calcium content correlates with the total atherosclerotic plaque burden, and calcium scoring by cardiac CT scan is sometimes used to estimate the severity of coronary artery disease.  However, low calcium content (or immature calcification) within an individual plaque may decrease stability of that plaque and increase the likelihood of rupture. $ (Choice D)  Ostial atherosclerotic plaques (those located at a branch point of 2 arteries) are more likely to occlude blood flow to multiple areas of myocardium, thereby limiting the availability of nearby well-perfused arteries from which viable collateral vessels can develop. $ Educational objective Gradually developing myocardial ischemia encourages the formation and maturation of collateral vessels and is most likely to occur in the setting of a slow-growing, stable atherosclerotic plaque.  An unstable atherosclerotic plaque (eg, that with active inflammation, a lipid-rich core, and/or a thin fibrous cap) is more likely to rupture, resulting in the abrupt onset of ischemia/infarction that precludes the development of viable collateral vessels.",

Up to 30% of cases may present with no apparent risk factors (eg, hypercoagulability). $ Massive PE can lead to hypotension and @obstructive shock@.  There is a rapid increase in pulmonary arterial resistance that leads to an increase in pulmonary arterial and right ventricular (RV) pressure.

Chagas disease is caused by infection with the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, which is transmitted by the triatomine 'kissing' bug (Reduviid family) found throughout the Americas as far north as the southern United States.  Infection is rare in developed regions, but the disease is endemic throughout #Central and South America# where widespread open-air and thatched-roof housing exposes individuals to routine contact with the triatomine vector. $ Years following initial infection, some individuals develop serious end-organ damage affecting the cardiac, gastrointestinal, and/or central nervous systems.  Cardiac disease results from a chronic parasite-induced and immune-mediated @myocarditis@ that leads to #dilated cardiomyopathy# (DCM).  Chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy is relatively unique among DCMs in that there is characteristically localized #apical wall thinning# with the development of a large apical #aneurysm#.  In addition to impairing ventricular systolic function, the aneurysm can harbor #mural thrombus# that may systemically embolize and cause stroke.  Damage to the cardiac conduction system can also trigger #ventricular arrhythmias# (eg, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation) that can lead to sudden cardiac death (the likely cause of death in this patient). $ The gastrointestinal manifestations of Chagas disease result from destruction of the myenteric plexus, which can lead to progressive dilation and dysfunction of the esophagus and, less commonly, the colon. $ #(Choices A, C, D, and E)#  Excessive alcohol consumption can lead to DCM.  Measles, mumps, and rubella are typically vaccinated against in childhood and are potential causes of viral DCM.  Genetic mutations of the gene encoding for the cardiac sarcomere protein titin can lead to familial DCM.  Miners and metal workers who are exposed to high levels of cobalt can develop DCM.  These DCMs typically involve diffuse left ventricular wall thinning, unlike the characteristic localized apical wall thinning and aneurysm development that occurs in chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy.  DCM due to ischemic heart disease may sometimes involve localized wall thinning with aneurysm development, but it is unlikely in this young man with no evidence of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease.  Esophageal enlargement is also not expected with these other etiologies of DCM. $ Educational objective Chagas disease is endemic to Central and South America and can lead to chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy, a dilated cardiomyopathy.

Common laboratory findings include elevated lactate dehydrogenase (reflecting cell necrosis), mild leukocytosis, and hematuria.  Serum creatinine is usually normal due to compensation by the unaffected kidney.  Macroscopically, renal infarcts appear as pale #wedges#, with the base (widest part) at the renal cortex and the apex pointing to the medulla. $ The most common cause of renal infarction is #systemic thromboembolism# from the left atrium or ventricle.  Thromboembolism is a common complication of #atrial fibrillation# because the irregular contractions lead to sluggish, uneven flow in the left atrium and facilitate clot formation.

      "explanation_2": "The appearance of vacuoles and phospholipid-containing amorphous densities within mitochondria generally signifies irreversible injury, and implies a permanent inability to generate further ATP via oxidative phosphorylation.  When the mitochondria are injured irreversibly, the cell cannot recover.  Simple mitochondrial swelling may be associated with reversible cellular injury, however. $ (Choice A)  Myofibril relaxation is an early sign of reversible injury in cardiac myocytes, which occurs within the first 30 minutes of severe ischemia.  Myofibril relaxation corresponds with intracellular ATP depletion and lactate accumulation due to anaerobic glycolysis during this period. $ (Choice B)  Disaggregation of polysomes denotes the dissociation of rRNA from mRNA in reversible ischemic/hypoxic injury.  Depletion of intracellular ATP is thought to promote the dissolution of polysomes into monosomes as well as the detachment of ribosomes from the rough endoplasmic reticulum.  Disaggregation of polysomes results in impaired protein synthesis. $ (Choice D)  Disaggregation of granular and fibrillar elements of the nucleus is associated with reversible cell injury.  Another common nuclear change associated with reversible cell injury is clumping of nuclear chromatin, perhaps secondary to a decrease in intracellular pH. $ (Choice E)  Triglyceride droplet accumulation is characteristic of reversible cell injury, especially in hepatocytes, and also in striated muscle cells and renal cells.  This fatty change may result from the decreased synthesis of intracellular proteins that occurs with cell injury.  In the hepatocyte, decreased production of lipid acceptor proteins prevents the normal incorporation of triglycerides into lipoproteins.  Since triglycerides cannot be rapidly exported from the cell in the form of lipoproteins, they accumulate intracellularly. $ (Choice F)  Glycogen loss is another early and reversible cellular response to injury.  As a result of lowered mitochondrial ATP production, ATP must be supplied to the cell via anaerobic glycolysis of glucose derived from the cell's glycogen stores.  Myocardial glycogen stores may be completely depleted within 30 minutes of the onset of severe ischemia. $ Educational Objective Mitochondrial vacuolization is typically a sign of irreversible cell injury, signifying that the involved mitochondria are permanently unable to generate ATP."

In the evolution of STEMI on ECG, peaked T waves in the affected leads are typically the first manifestation, followed by the appearance of ST elevation within several minutes, then Q waves within hours to days.  Patients with STEMI typically have sudden-onset substernal chest pain that may be accompanied by nausea, diaphoresis, or dyspnea; the pain does not improve with rest or the administration of short-acting nitrates (eg, nitroglycerin). $Myocardial infarction is usually caused by acute #atherosclerotic plaque rupture# with release of lipids, collagen, and tissue factor into the blood stream; because these contents are highly thrombogenic, there is rapid formation of #overlying thrombus#.  In STEMI, the overlying thrombus is extensive enough to fully occlude the coronary artery lumen, completely blocking blood flow to a portion of the heart and leading to transmural (full-thickness) infarction of the myocardial wall.  Partially obstructive thrombus #(choice E)# is likely to produce non-STEMI or unstable angina.  Non-STEMI is associated with impaired blood flow to only the subendocardial region; the symptomatic presentation is similar to STEMI, but ECG reveals ST segment and T wave abnormalities with no ST elevation. $ (Choice A)  Atherosclerotic plaque obstructing 50% of the coronary artery lumen is likely to be asymptomatic.  Symptoms of stable angina do not typically become prominent until >70% of the cross-sectional area of the coronary artery lumen is occluded. $ (Choice B)  Atherosclerotic plaque obstructing 80% of the coronary artery lumen is likely to cause stable angina, characterized by substernal or left-sided chest pressure, tightness, or pain that is precipitated by exertion and relieved by rest or short-acting nitrates. $ (Choice D)  Coronary artery vasospasm (vasospastic or Prinzmetal angina) results from hyperactivity of intimal smooth muscle, usually in the absence of significant atherosclerotic coronary artery disease.  Transient anginal chest pain with corresponding ST elevation on ECG can occur; however, the chest pain should rapidly resolve with nitroglycerin. $ Educational objective ST-elevation myocardial infarction involves transmural (full-thickness) infarction of the myocardial wall, and usually results from acute atherosclerotic plaque rupture with the development of overlying thrombus that fully occludes the coronary artery lumen.

      "explanation_2": "$This patient likely has #pulmonic valve stenosis# (PS), which most commonly occurs as an isolated #congenital defect# and rarely occurs as an acquired defect (eg, rheumatic fever, carcinoid syndrome).  Severe PS is typically diagnosed early in life due to development of right-sided heart failure, but patients with relatively mild PS often do not present with symptoms (eg, dyspnea, fatigue) until adulthood.  The physiologic changes of pregnancy (eg, increased plasma volume) can unmask underlying PS. $ Cardiac auscultation in PS reveals a pulmonic #ejection click# followed by a harsh #crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur# best heard at the @left upper sternal border@.  The stenosis causes the pulmonic valve to close later than usual as it takes longer for the right ventricle to push blood through the narrowed valve.  This results in #widened splitting# of the aortic and pulmonic components of S2.  Inspiration draws additional blood into the right side of heart, which increases the intensity of the murmur and further widens the splitting of S2. $ Pulmonary hypertension is another cause of widened splitting of S2 because more time is required for the right ventricle to overcome pulmonary arterial pressure (ie, the pulmonic valve opens later and closes later). $ (Choice A)  A benign flow murmur can occur in patients with high cardiac output states (eg, pregnancy) due to increased flow across the aortic and pulmonic valves; however, the murmur is typically low grade (2/6 or less) and abnormal splitting of S2 is not present. $ (Choice B)  A bicuspid aortic valve is the most common congenital heart defect seen in adults and can lead to aortic stenosis in relatively young patients (eg, those in their 50s).  However, aortic stenosis causes delayed closure of the aortic valve, leading to narrowed or paradoxical splitting of S2. $ (Choice C)  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can cause a @systolic murmur@ that mimics that of aortic stenosis and is best heard at the mid-left sternal border.  Aortic valve closure may be delayed due to prolonged ejection of blood through the left ventricular outflow tract. $ (Choice E)  A small- or moderate-sized ventricular septal defect may present in adulthood with symptoms of heart failure.  There is typically widened splitting of S2 due to early closure of the aortic valve (less blood is ejected into the aorta because some blood is ejected into the right ventricle).  However, a holosystolic murmur best heard at the left lower sternal border is expected. $ Educational objective Pulmonic valve stenosis causes a crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur (best heard at the left upper sternal border) and delays closure of the pulmonic valve, resulting in widened splitting of S2.  Inspiration increases blood flow to the right side of the heart, causing increased intensity of the murmur and even later closure of the pulmonic valve.",

      "explanation_2": "#Myocardial hibernation# refers to a state of #chronic myocardial ischemia# in which both myocardial metabolism and function are reduced to match a concomitant reduction in coronary blood flow (due to moderate/severe flow-limiting stenosis).  This new equilibrium prevents myocardial necrosis.  Chronically hibernating myocardium demonstrates decreased expression and disorganization of contractile and cytoskeletal proteins, altered adrenergic control, and reduced calcium responsiveness.  These changes lead to #decreased contractility# and left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction.  However, coronary revascularization and subsequent restoration of blood flow to hibernating myocardium improves contractility and LV function. $ (Choice B)  Ischemic preconditioning is a phenomenon in which brief repetitive episodes of myocardial ischemia, followed by reperfusion, protect the myocardium from subsequent prolonged episodes of ischemia.  In clinical terms, repetitive episodes of angina prior to myocardial infarction can delay cell death after complete coronary occlusion and therefore provide greater time for myocardial salvage with coronary revascularization. $ (Choice C)  Post-infarction myocardial scarring refers to the replacement of myocardium with collagen and fibrous tissue.  This leads to complete loss of myocardial contractile function, and cardiac contractility would not be expected to improve with coronary revascularization. $ (Choice D)  Reperfusion injury refers to further myocardial cell damage due to restoration of blood flow after a sudden ischemic event.  The clinical manifestations of reperfusion injury include arrhythmias, microvascular dysfunction with myocardial stunning, and myocyte injury and death. $ (Choice E)  Ventricular remodeling refers to a change in the structure (cardiac mass or dimensions) or function of the heart in response to cardiac injury or hemodynamic changes (pressure/volume overload).  Remodeling can occur with long-term myocardial hibernation, but it would take weeks to months (not days) to recover following reperfusion therapy. $ Educational objective Hibernating myocardium refers to the presence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction due to reduced coronary blood flow at rest that is partially or completely reversible by coronary revascularization."

Mutation of the fibrillin-1 gene results in elastic tissue fragmentation, which predisposes affected patients to #aortic aneurysms# (with an intact intima) and dissections (with an intimal tear). $ Beta-aminopropionitrile (a chemical found in certain kinds of sweet peas) causes inhibition of lysyl oxidase, an enzyme responsible for cross-linking elastin fibers and collagen fibers.  Ingestion of this compound can cause #connective tissue disruption# in the aorta that mimics the myxomatous degeneration seen in patients with Marfan syndrome. $ (Choice B)  Atherosclerosis is the formation of intimal atheromas in response to chronic or repetitive endothelial injury.  Myxomatous degeneration does not play a significant role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. $ (Choice C)  The pathogenesis of berry aneurysms is multifactorial.  Contributory factors include hemodynamic stress, hypertension, and certain connective tissue disorders.  Type IV Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (which results in abnormalities in type III collagen) predisposes patients to the development of berry aneurysms.  Myxomatous degeneration is not associated with berry aneurysms. $ (Choice D)  A @false aneurysm@, or pseudoaneurysm, is the result of a breach in the continuity of all the layers of a blood vessel, leading to blood leakage outside the vessel wall (eg, hematoma).  The intima would not be intact in a false aneurysm. $ (Choice E)  Giant cell arteritis involves granulomatous inflammation of the media and fragmentation of the internal elastic lamina, perhaps due to autoimmunity to elastin.  It is not related to myxomatous changes of the arterial wall. $ (Choice F)  Hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis of the renal arterioles is associated with malignant hypertension.  It results from concentric lamellar reduplication of the intimal smooth muscle cells (\"onion-skinning\").  Myxomatous degeneration is not a contributing factor. $ Educational objective Myxomatous changes, with pooling of mucopolysaccharides in the media layer of large arteries, are found in cystic medial degeneration, which predisposes affected patients to the development of aortic aneurysms.  Medial degeneration in younger individuals is frequently due to Marfan syndrome.",

This dense, rigid pericardial tissue encases the heart and #restricts ventricular filling#, causing low cardiac output (manifesting with fatigue and dyspnea on exertion) and progressive #right-sided heart# failure (manifesting with hepatomegaly and peripheral edema). $ Physical examination in constrictive pericarditis typically shows #elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP)# with prominent x and y descents and a #pericardial knock# (early diastolic sound that occurs before S3) and may also demonstrate #pulsus paradoxus# (>10 mm Hg drop in systolic blood pressure during inspiration).  In addition, #Kussmaul sign# may be present.  Under normal circumstances, the decrease in intrathoracic pressure during inspiration increases venous return to the right side of the heart and lowers JVP.  However, in constrictive pericarditis, the rigid pericardium prevents the right side of the heart from accommodating increased venous return, which leads to a #paradoxical rise in JVP during inspiration#, referred to as Kussmaul sign. $ (Choice B)  A loud pulmonic component of the second heart sound (P2) is heard in patients with pulmonary hypertension. $ (Choice C)  During inspiration, venous return to the right side of the heart is increased, resulting in later closure of the pulmonic valve and physiologic splitting of the aortic (A2) and pulmonic components of S2.  Paradoxical splitting occurs when cardiac pathology (eg, aortic stenosis, left bundle branch block) delays closure of the aortic valve, causing A2 to occur noticeably later than P2. $ (Choice D)  An S3 gallop occurs due to the sudden deceleration of blood as it enters a dilated ventricle; it is typically heard in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy or severe mitral regurgitation. $ (Choice E)  A sustained left parasternal lift is most commonly a sign of right ventricular hypertrophy, such as occurs with chronic right ventricular pressure overload (eg, pulmonary hypertension, pulmonic stenosis) or volume overload (eg, tricuspid regurgitation). $ Educational objective In constrictive pericarditis, normal pericardium is replaced by dense, rigid pericardial tissue that restricts ventricular filling, leading to low cardiac output and progressive right-sided heart failure.  Physical examination findings in such patients include elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), pericardial knock, pulsus paradoxus, and a paradoxical rise in JVP with inspiration (Kussmaul sign)."

In early stages, myocardial iron overload is expressed as #diastolic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction# with a restrictive filling pattern.  As the disease advances, progressive ventricular remodeling leads to #dilated cardiomyopathy# and reduced LV ejection fraction.

It is not associated with hyperpigmentation. $ (Choice B)  Primary adrenal insufficiency (ie, cortisol deficiency) can cause hyperpigmentation due to cosecretion of melanocyte-stimulating hormone with ACTH (both derived from proopiomelanocortin).  However, hepatomegaly is not seen, and although hypotension is common, sinus node and diastolic dysfunction are not. $ (Choice C)  Sarcoidosis results from widespread formation of noncaseating granulomas.  Cardiac infiltration can cause conduction blockade, and liver involvement may result in hepatomegaly.  However, lung symptoms (eg, dyspnea, cough) are more common, and skin manifestations include papules and nodules rather than hyperpigmentation. $ (Choice D)  HH is associated with mutations in the HFE gene; the @HFE protein@ binds to the transferrin receptor and regulates intestinal and hepatic iron uptake.  Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mutations are associated with autoimmune disorders (eg, celiac disease, type 1 diabetes). $ (Choice F)  Glycogen storage disease type II (ie, Pompe disease) is caused by a deficiency in alpha-glucosidase (acid maltase).

Concentric hypertrophy is characterized by #uniform# thickening of the ventricular wall with the outer dimensions of the ventricle remaining almost unchanged, resulting in a narrowed ventricular cavity size.  It is due to chronic elevation of ventricular pressures during systole, which is usually caused by #long-standing hypertension# or aortic stenosis (#increased LV afterload#).  Patients may develop diastolic dysfunction with left atrial enlargement and congestive heart failure due to impaired ventricular compliance and filling. $ (Choice A)  An atrial septal defect causes a shunting of blood flow from the left to right atrium.  This typically results in volume overload of the right ventricle, producing right atrial enlargement and eccentric (dilated) right ventricular hypertrophy. $ (Choice C)  Mitral insufficiency causes LV volume overload as regurgitant flow through the mitral valve during systole increases the amount of blood returning to the LV during diastole.  The net structural consequence of mitral insufficiency is enlargement of the LV cavity and eccentric hypertrophy. $ (Choice D)  Mitral stenosis leads to left atrial enlargement due to elevated pressure in the left atrium.  The LV cavity is typically small/normal in size with normal wall thickness due to restriction of blood flow across the mitral valve. $ (Choice E)  Aging is associated with a decrease in LV chamber size, predominantly through shortening of the apex-to-base dimension accompanied by a leftward bowing of the lower interventricular (sigmoid) septum.  The aortic valve may also become calcified, resulting in aortic stenosis; however, structural cardiac changes due to aging are generally not prominent before age 65. $ (Choice F)  The ventricular remodeling that occurs after an acute myocardial infarction involves expansion, thinning, and fibrous healing of the infarcted zone of myocardium.  Regional dysfunction of the infarcted myocardium causes volume overload for the remaining viable myocardium.  The net result is usually eccentric hypertrophy, with enlargement of the LV cavity. $ (Choice G)  Patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome have an accessory pathway that bypasses the atrioventricular node and directly connects the atria and ventricles.  This results in ventricular preexcitation and the development of tachyarrhythmias.  The LV usually appears grossly normal. $ Educational objective Concentric hypertrophy is characterized by uniform thickening of the ventricular wall and narrowing of the ventricular cavity due to increased afterload (eg, chronic hypertension, aortic stenosis).  Eccentric hypertrophy is characterized by reduced ventricular wall thickness with an associated increase in chamber size due to volume overload."

These increased concentrations attract free water, causing cellular and mitochondrial swelling.  Failure of the sarcoplasmic reticulum to resequester Ca2+ leads to cessation of contraction within ischemic zones of myocardium. $ (Choice A)  The cell membrane Na+/K+-ATPase pump normally brings K+ into the cell in exchange for Na+.  Thus, in ischemic tissue, intracellular K+ is decreased. $ (Choice C)  Cellular HCO3- is not elevated in cardiac ischemia.  Anaerobic metabolism leads to lactic acid production and a decrease in pH.

The cell's response to ischemia does involve initiating certain metabolic processes through protein phosphorylation, but this does not cause cell swelling. $ (Choice E)  Ischemia causes a net solute gain within cardiac myocytes.  Elevated concentrations of Na+ and Ca2+ draw free water into the cells, causing edema. $ Educational Objective Ion pump failure due to ATP deficiency during cardiac ischemia causes intracellular accumulation of Na+ and Ca2+.  The increased intracellular solute concentration draws free water into the cell, causing the cellular and mitochondrial swelling that is observed histologically."

These findings are consistent with #acute decompensated heart failure# (ADHF); chronic hypertension is a common cause of heart failure due to concentric left ventricular hypertrophy and resulting diastolic dysfunction. $ In ADHF, increased atrial and ventricular filling pressures are transmitted to the pulmonary vasculature, causing fluid transudation into pulmonary interstitial and alveolar spaces (#cardiogenic pulmonary edema#).

The appearance on chest x-ray is similar to ADHF, but pleural effusions are typically less prominent with ARDS (mostly alveolar opacification is seen), and ADHF is more likely given the absence of an inciting event in the patient's history. $ (Choice C)  The chest x-ray in @idiopathic interstitial fibrosis@ shows diffuse, reticular opacities typically associated with decreased lung volumes.

Several genetic mutations involving the sarcomere structure and function have been identified in patients with familial dilated cardiomyopathy.  However, abnormal transmembrane K+ currents are not known to be directly involved in the pathophysiology. $ Educational objective Congenital long QT syndrome is most often caused by genetic mutations in a K+ channel protein that contributes to the outward-rectifying potassium current.

Benign ulcers are typically clean-based with regular borders (as opposed to this patient's ulcerated lesion with irregular, heaped-up borders); in addition, intestinal metaplasia is unexpected. $ (Choice C)  Excessive consumption of hot beverages is associated with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, not gastric adenocarcinoma. $ (Choice D)  Disruption of the lower esophageal sphincter enables gastric acid to reflux into the esophagus, which predisposes patients to esophageal intestinal metaplasia (eg, Barrett esophagus) and ultimately esophageal adenocarcinoma.  However, this is not a risk factor for gastric adenocarcinoma. $ Educational objective Intestinal-type gastric adenocarcinoma is visualized endoscopically as an ulcerated mass with irregular folded or heaped-up edges.  Histologically, it resembles colon adenocarcinoma and is characterized by glandular structures containing intestinal-like columnar (or cuboidal) cells.  Risk factors include Helicobacter pylori infection, a high-salt diet, n-nitroso–containing compounds, and autoimmune atrophic gastritis."

Those specifically designated as #peptic ulcers# are chronic lesions in areas exposed to acid/peptic juices, most commonly in the proximal duodenum, antral stomach, and gastroesophageal junction.  Patients may present with epigastric discomfort, early satiety, and a positive fecal occult blood test. $ Almost all peptic ulcers are due to either #Helicobacter pylori# infection or use of #nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)#.  The vast majority (>95%) of duodenal ulcers occur within the first part of the duodenum; however, multiple or refractory ulcers beyond the duodenal bulb may be seen in patients with gastrinoma (non-beta islet cell tumor of the pancreas). #Duodenal ulcers# are very #rarely malignant# and do not require biopsy.  Conversely, gastric ulcers (located within the stomach) can be malignant (eg, gastric adenocarcinoma) and must be biopsied for confirmation #(choice E)#. Gastric ulcers caused by H pylori infection are associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer, but duodenal ulcers related to this infection do not lead to a higher risk of duodenal carcinoma. $ (Choice B)  Esophageal adenocarcinoma can appear as an ulcerated/exophytic lesion in the lower third of the esophagus and typically results from Barrett esophagus, chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease, obesity, and/or smoking.  Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma appears as plaque-like thickening of the mucosa in the upper two-thirds of the esophagus that may become ulcerated.  Major risk factors include smoking, alcohol consumption, and caustic injury. $ #(Choices C and D)# Carcinomas of the distal colon tend to be annular lesions that result in \"napkin-ring\" constriction of the bowel, with heaped-up edges and an ulcerated central region.  Risk factors include advanced age, hereditary (eg, familial adenomatous polyposis) or sporadic colon cancer in the family, and inflammatory bowel disease. $ Educational objective Duodenal ulcers are not associated with an increased risk of carcinoma in the same location.  In contrast, ulcers located in the esophagus, stomach (gastric), and colon may be malignant, and biopsy is required."

Patients typically present with persistent right upper quadrant pain, fever, and leukocytosis.  Examination classically shows Murphy sign, an inspiratory pause elicited by pain during deep palpation of the right upper quadrant.  Symptoms are often preceded by transient episodes of abdominal pain and nausea after fatty meals due to temporary cystic duct obstruction (biliary colic). $ Persistent gallbladder outflow obstruction promotes hydrolysis of luminal lecithins to lysolecithins, which disrupts the protective mucus layer.  The luminal epithelium is then exposed to the detergent action of the bile salts, resulting in chemical irritation and prostaglandin release.  Inflammation of the mucosa and deeper tissues causes gallbladder hypomotility.  The increasing distension and internal pressure within the gallbladder eventually result in ischemia.  Finally, bacteria (eg, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus, Klebsiella, Enterobacter) invade the injured and necrotic gallbladder wall, causing an infection #(choice A)#. $ #(Choices B and D)#  The gallbladder is vulnerable to ischemic injury as the cystic artery lacks collateral circulation.  Although inflammation/edema of the gallbladder may compromise blood flow, ischemic disruption of the mucosal layer is usually the next to last step in the pathogenesis of acute calculous cholecystitis.  Gallbladder ischemia is not typically caused by cystic artery thrombosis. $ (Choice E)  Lecithin hydrolysis and mucosal damage occur after gallbladder outflow obstruction in the pathogenesis of acute calculous cholecystitis. $ Educational objective Acute calculous cholecystitis is an acute inflammation of the gallbladder initiated by gallstone obstruction of the cystic duct.

  "explanation_2": "$The #prognosis of colorectal cancer# is most tightly correlated with tumor stage at diagnosis.  Stage reflects the #degree of tumor invasion and spread# from the initial site of formation.  Colorectal tumors confined to the basement membrane or lamina propria are considered to be carcinoma in situ and have an excellent 5-year survival rate (>90%).  Invasion of the tumor into the muscularis propria, the location of the colonic lymphatic channels, is associated with a slightly worse prognosis (5-year survival rate of 70%-80%) due to elevated rates of tumor spread through lymphatics or to adjacent organs. $ The prognosis of colon cancer deteriorates when tumor cells are identified in regional lymph nodes (5-year survival rate of 50%-80%).  #Lymph node spread# is thought to be one of the strongest predictors of metastatic potential and, therefore, indicates an #increased risk# for incurable, distant disease.  Metastatic spread to distant organs (eg, lungs, liver) is associated with the worst 5-year survival rates (<15%). $ (Choice A)  Tumor grade, the degree of cellular differentiation of tumor cells, also affects prognosis.  Well-differentiated (low-grade) colonic tumors have glandular structure and are associated with a better prognosis than poorly differentiated (high-grade) colonic tumors, which appear as sheets or cords of cells with pleomorphism, high mitotic rates, and other signs of significant cellular aberration.  Grade is a less important prognostic indicator than stage. $ (Choice B)  Cytokeratin 20 is a marker of intestinal cell differentiation.  Testing for the presence of this structural protein helps confirm that adenocarcinomas are of intestinal origin; it is not a prognostic indicator. $ (Choice C)  The invasion of colorectal cancer into the lamina propria is considered to be carcinoma in situ because lymphatic channels do not arise until the subsequent layer (muscularis propria).  Patients with colorectal tumors confined to the basement membrane or lamina propria have an excellent prognosis. $ (Choice D)  Cytotoxic T-cell (lymphocytic) invasion of tumor cells is a favorable prognostic indicator as it signifies immune recognition.  It is associated with a lower risk of metastases and improved survival. $ Educational objective Tumor stage (degree of invasion/spread) is the most important prognostic determinant for colorectal cancer.  Tumors confined to the basement membrane and lamina propria are early stage and have the best prognosis.

Microscopically, these tumors consist of cavernous, blood-filled vascular spaces of variable size lined by a single epithelial layer (arrow).  Collagenous scars or fibrous nodules may be seen in association with thrombosis.  Most patients are asymptomatic, although some will complain of abdominal pain and right upper quadrant fullness.

To prevent autodigestion, most pancreatic digestive enzymes (except for amylase and lipase) are secreted in an inactive form and are @activated@ on arrival in the duodenum.  In @acute pancreatitis@, intrapancreatic activation of enzymes result in acinar cell damage and pancreatic inflammation. $ The release of #lipase# and other digestive enzymes from the inflamed pancreas damages nearby adipose cells.  Liberated fatty acids bind calcium ions, precipitating as #insoluble calcium salts# (ie, saponification) that have a #chalky white# appearance grossly.  Microscopically, #necrotic adipocytes# (ie, @anucleate adipocytes@ with necrotic debris) and blue calcium deposits are seen (compared to a @normal pancreas@). $ In mild cases, small areas of fat necrosis may be found within and around the pancreas, along with an edematous and inflamed pancreatic parenchyma.  If the inflammatory process continues, @acute necrotic pancreatitis@ develops.  This is characterized by #parenchymal necrosis# and more #extensive fat necrosis#, which can spread to involve the #mesentery#, omentum, and other parts of the abdominal cavity (due to widespread lipase activity).  Elastase-mediated destruction of blood vessel walls can cause hemorrhage into the necrotic areas (ie, hemorrhagic pancreatitis), and black hemorrhage may be seen grossly. $ (Choice B)  Bacterial peritonitis is characterized by a dull-appearing peritoneal surface with areas of viscous white-yellow suppurative exudate.  Microscopic examination of the ascitic fluid shows numerous neutrophils. $ (Choice C)  In celiac disease, gross examination of an involved bowel segment would show normal-appearing serosa and mesentery. $ (Choice D)  Crohn disease often shows mesenteric fat grossly extending around the serosa of an affected intestinal segment (ie, \"creeping fat\").

  "explanation_2": "$The patient's contrast-enhanced CT scan shows #multiple hypodense masses# in the liver (arrows) consistent with #metastatic liver disease#.  Metastases are the most common malignant neoplasms of the adult liver and are 20 times more common than hepatocellular carcinoma.  The liver is the second most common site of metastatic spread (after the lymph nodes) because of its large size, dual blood supply, high perfusion rate, and the filtration function of Kupffer cells. $ Patients with liver metastases typically have multiple nodules throughout the liver that may replace more than 80% of the hepatic parenchyma, often resulting in marked #hepatomegaly#.  The nodules frequently outgrow their vascular supply and become centrally necrotic and umbilicated.  Even with significant metastatic involvement, patients may have no clinical or laboratory signs suggestive of hepatic insufficiency.  However, once the majority of the liver parenchyma is destroyed or the major bile ducts become obstructed with tumor, patients tend to present with jaundice or #abnormal hepatic enzymes# (eg, elevated aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase). $ (Choice A)  Hepatic adenomas are uncommon, benign epithelial tumors of the liver that usually arise as a solitary mass in the right hepatic lobe.  They are strongly associated with the use of oral contraceptives and anabolic steroids and are usually diagnosed in patients with upper abdominal pain or detected incidentally on imaging studies.  They may rupture and cause intraabdominal hemorrhage. $ (Choice B)  Hepatic angiosarcomas are associated with recent or remote exposure to vinyl chloride, arsenic, or Thorotrast.  This tumor is extremely aggressive and is associated with a poor prognosis, as most patients die within a year. $ (Choice C)  Hepatoblastoma is the most common liver neoplasm of children and is associated with familial adenomatous polyposis and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndromes.  This neoplasm is usually fatal within a few years if not surgically resected. $ (Choice D)  Hepatocellular carcinoma can present unifocally, multifocally, or as a diffusely infiltrative cancer.  It is more common in older patients with a history of cirrhosis or infection with hepatitis B or C. $ (Choice E)  Cholangiocarcinoma is a rare malignancy that arises from the intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts.  Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma appears grossly as a treelike mass that grows along the biliary system, typically resulting in extensive intrahepatic metastasis.  Risk factors include primary sclerosing cholangitis, fibropolycystic liver disease, and infection with liver flukes in endemic areas.  The prognosis is very poor. $ Educational objective Malignant hepatic lesions most often represent metastasis from another primary site (eg, breast, lung, colon); primary liver neoplasms (eg, hepatocellular carcinoma) are much less common."

Alpha-1 antitrypsin is a serine #protease inhibitor# that regulates the activity of a number of @tissue-destructive proteases@, most importantly neutrophil #elastase#.  Deficiency is inherited in an autosomal codominant fashion. $ AATD leads to unchecked elastase activity in the lungs, resulting in alveolar destruction and lung hyperinflation; the @panacinar emphysema@ tends to favor the basilar lung regions and typically develops prior to age 50.  In addition, some patients are at risk for developing #liver disease# due to accumulation of improperly folded alpha-1 antitrypsin proteins in hepatocytes.  Liver disease is of greatest concern in the first 2 decades of life, but it can present at any age.  Patients can experience hepatomegaly, hyperbilirubinemia, elevated transaminases, and eventual cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease.  Hepatocellular carcinoma may also develop. $ (Choice A)  Autoimmune injury of intrahepatic bile ducts occurs in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC).  PBC predominantly affects women and is characterized by positive antimitochondrial antibodies.  It is not associated with emphysema. $ (Choice B) @UDP-glucuronosyltransferase@ is an enzyme that converts unconjugated bilirubin to its conjugated form, and inherited deficiency can exist in varying degrees.  Mild deficiency results in benign elevations in unconjugated bilirubin during periods of stress (ie, Gilbert syndrome), while severe deficiency can be fatal during infancy (ie, Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I). $ (Choice C)  Defective epithelial chloride transport occurs in cystic fibrosis.  Patients typically develop obstructive lung disease in the form of bronchiectasis and can have pancreatic insufficiency leading to malabsorption.  Cirrhosis can sometimes occur due to chronic obstruction of the biliary ducts, but almost always develops during childhood. $ (Choice D)  Defective copper transport resulting in accumulation of intracellular copper occurs in Wilson disease.  Patients can develop cirrhosis as well as brain degeneration leading to neurologic (eg, dysarthria, gait abnormalities) and psychiatric (eg, impulsivity) manifestations. $ (Choice F)  Unregulated gastrointestinal iron absorption occurs in hemochromatosis.  Patients can develop cirrhosis due to iron overload.  The joints (arthritis), pancreas (diabetes mellitus), and heart (cardiomyopathy) are also commonly affected, but lung involvement is not typical. $ Educational objective Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is a serine protease inhibitor that regulates the activity of elastase in the lung.

However, the erythrocyte count takes longer to normalize (hemoglobin levels rise ~1 g/week) and the anemia typically takes as long as 8 weeks to correct. $ (Choice A)  The erythrocyte count curve would be expected to follow the hemoglobin curve upward as the total red blood cell pool gradually returns to normal levels. $ (Choice B)  In chronic atrophic gastritis, parietal cell loss results in profound hypochlorhydria, increased serum gastrin levels, and inadequate intrinsic factor production.  This patient most likely has elevated gastrin levels that would be unaffected by vitamin B12 replacement. $ (Choice C)  Vitamin B12 deficiency causes increased red blood cell breakdown due to ineffective erythropoiesis, and the resulting release of free hemoglobin leads to a decrease in serum haptoglobin levels.  Haptoglobin levels would normalize (increase) with therapy. $ (Choice D) @Methylmalonic acid is elevated@ in vitamin B12 deficiency due to decreased metabolism and would decline with vitamin B12 supplementation.  In this case, the blue curve rises after the beginning of treatment, which would not be expected. $ Educational objective Atrophic gastritis can result in profound hypochlorhydria, inadequate intrinsic factor production, vitamin B12 deficiency, and elevated methylmalonic acid levels.  Once vitamin B12 replacement therapy is initiated, the reticulocyte count increases dramatically and peaks around 1 week; hemoglobin levels and erythrocyte counts rise more gradually and take up to 8 weeks to normalize.",

Gallstone ileus is not a true ileus (nonmechanical disruption of intestinal motility) but rather a mechanical obstruction that occurs when a large gallstone (usually >2.5 cm in diameter) erodes into the intestinal lumen through a #cholecystoenteric fistula#.  As the gallstone travels down the intestine, it intermittently obstructs the lumen, causing episodic symptoms.  Eventually, the gallstone may come to rest in the ileum, which has the smallest lumen of the intestinal tract. $ Typical symptoms of gallstone ileus include crampy pain, vomiting, and bloating.  Examination will show signs of #small bowel obstruction#, such as abdominal distension, tenderness, and high-pitched (tinkling) bowel sounds.  Abdominal radiographs may reveal dilated bowel loops with air-fluid levels.  Careful inspection may also reveal air in the biliary tree (#pneumobilia#) due to retrograde passage of intestinal gas through the fistula. $ (Choice B)  Bladder distension due to urinary retention is most often associated with underlying prostatic hyperplasia, anticholinergic medication use, and underlying neurologic impairment. $ (Choice C)  Air in the peritoneal cavity is suggestive of bowel perforation.  Although the bowel wall is disrupted in gallstone ileus, the cholecystoenteric fistula is usually associated with fibrotic adhesions between the biliary tree and the bowel, and there is no free communication with the peritoneal cavity. $ (Choice D)  Heavily calcified vessels are a sign of chronic atherosclerotic arterial disease.  Common intra-abdominal complications in such patients would include intestinal ischemia and abdominal aortic aneurysm. $ (Choice E)  Pancreatic calcifications are suggestive of chronic pancreatitis, which is most commonly seen in alcohol abuse, cystic fibrosis, or outlet obstruction due to tumor, pseudocysts, or recurrent passage of gallstones. $ (Choice F)  Pleural effusion may be seen in a broad range of intra-abdominal conditions, such as pancreatitis, esophageal rupture, or chronic hepatic or renal disease. $ Educational objective Gallstone ileus is a mechanical bowel obstruction caused when a large gallstone erodes into the intestinal lumen.  Pneumobilia (air in the biliary tract) is a common finding."

This finding is characteristic of #Hirschsprung disease# (HD), a congenital disorder caused by disrupted migration of neural crest cells to the intestinal wall during embryogenesis.  Neural crest cells normally migrate in a craniocaudal direction and give rise to ganglion cells of the submucosal (Meissner) and myenteric (Auerbach) plexus in the colon.  Abnormal migration results in the absence of parasympathetic innervation of the distal rectosigmoid segment. $ Without parasympathetic innervation, the #aganglionic colonic segment# is unable to relax (ie, chronically contracted and narrowed), making stool difficult to pass.  Presentation in the neonatal period with delayed passage of meconium (>48 hr after birth) is classic, but infants with short aganglionic segments may have fussiness due to #infrequent stooling#/chronic constipation.  The buildup of stool causes #abdominal distension# and #dilation# of the histologically normal colon proximal to the obstruction. $ Diagnosis of HD is confirmed by the absence of ganglia on rectal suction biopsy.  Treatment is with surgical resection of the aganglionic segment. $ (Choice A)  Paravertebral ganglia lie adjacent to the vertebrae and are involved in sympathetic nervous signaling; paravertebral ganglia are not affected by HD. $ (Choice B)  Disruption of small bowel recanalization is the cause of @duodenal atresia@, which presents in the first 1-2 days of life with bilious emesis.

Abdominal pain and distension are typical, but barium enema would not show a rectosigmoid transition zone; instead, oral contrast studies would show absence of barium beyond the duodenum. $ Educational objective Hirschsprung disease is characterized by absent submucosal and myenteric ganglion cells in the distal colon.

The formation of @pseudomembranes@ (white-yellow plaques composed of fibrin, inflammatory cells, and cellular debris) on the colonic mucosa is highly consistent with pseudomembranous colitis due to #Clostridioides difficile#, a spore-forming bacillus that colonizes up to 50% of hospitalized adults. #Antibiotic therapy# (eg, fluoroquinolones for bacterial pneumonia) #increases the risk# of C difficile infection because it kills intestinal microbes that normally keep potential pathogens in check.  C difficile can proliferate in the altered microbiome, leading to overgrowth and clinical disease. $ C difficile produces 2 toxins—toxin A (enterotoxin) and toxin B (cytotoxin)—which penetrate colonic epithelial cells and damage cellular cytoskeletons and intercellular tight junctions.  This results in widespread inflammation, edema, necrosis, and fibrin deposition.  Clinical manifestations range from watery diarrhea and mild abdominal cramping to fulminant colitis with nonobstructive colonic enlargement (megacolon) and intestinal perforation. $ #(Choices A and B)# Ingestion of undercooked shellfish is associated with Vibrio, Norwalk virus, and hepatitis A infections.  Traveler's diarrhea, caused by bacteria (eg, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella) or parasites (eg, Giardia), is often due to contaminated water consumption.  These conditions can manifest as diarrhea and abdominal pain; however, pseudomembranes are virtually pathognomonic for C difficile colitis. $ (Choice C)  Consumption of undercooked pork is a risk factor for intestinal tapeworm (taeniasis), which occurs after ingestion of Taenia solium.  Patients are often asymptomatic but may have nausea or abdominal pain. $ (Choice E)  Adult botulism occurs after ingestion of preformed toxin in home-canned food.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient's clinical presentation is highly suggestive of #Zollinger-Ellison syndrome# (ZES).  ZES is caused by gastrin-secreting neuroendocrine tumors (#gastrinomas#) that are most commonly located in the small intestine or pancreas.  The gastrin produced by these tumors stimulates gastric acid production, often resulting in multiple #peptic ulcers# that can be located #beyond the duodenal bulb# and are often refractory to therapy.  Patients typically experience #abdominal pain# and acid reflux.  They may also have #diarrhea# as gastric acid damages intestinal epithelial cells and inactivates pancreatic enzymes, preventing proper nutrient absorption. $ The diagnosis of gastrinoma is made by measuring basal and stimulated gastrin levels (secretin stimulation test).  Patients with ZES should undergo testing (eg, serum calcium, prolactin level) to exclude #multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1# due to the strong association between these conditions. $ (Choice B)  Glucagonomas are rare pancreatic alpha-cell tumors that present with diabetes mellitus and a raised erythematous rash that typically affects the groin (necrolytic migratory erythema). $ (Choice C)  Insulinomas are pancreatic beta-cell tumors that secrete insulin autonomously, regardless of blood glucose levels.  As a result, patients usually have high circulating insulin/C-peptide levels and symptoms of hypoglycemia (eg, tremor, confusion). $ (Choice D)  Carcinoid syndrome is most frequently caused by neuroendocrine tumors originating in the small intestine that have metastasized to the liver.  These tumors secrete products such as serotonin and bradykinin, resulting in diarrhea, episodic flushing, right-sided valvular heart disease, and wheezing. $ (Choice E)  Somatostatinomas are rare tumors of the pancreatic D cells that present with diabetes mellitus (diminished insulin secretion), cholelithiasis (inhibition of cholecystokinin release), and diarrhea/steatorrhea (inhibition of pancreatic enzyme/bicarbonate secretion). $ (Choice F)  Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide is secreted by VIPomas, rare neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas.  Patients typically have diarrhea that persists with fasting, achlorhydria, and hypokalemia. $ Educational objective Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is caused by gastrin-secreting tumors (gastrinomas) involving the small intestine or pancreas.

It is protected from gastric acid by endogenous urease production: #urease# converts urea to ammonia, which alkalinizes the surrounding pH but injures gastric epithelial cells.  Damage to the gastric mucosa is compounded by localized inflammation due to the immunologic response against H pylori. $ Chronic inflammation due to H pylori colonization in the #gastric antrum# leads to #depletion of somatostatin-producing cells# (@delta cells@), which are located mostly in the antrum.  Somatostatin inhibits gastrin release from G-cells.  In its absence, #elevated gastrin# levels act directly (via cholecystokinin B receptors) and indirectly (via histamine release by enterochromaffin-like cells) to #increase acid secretion# by parietal cells.  In addition, H pylori releases cytotoxins that inhibit duodenal production of bicarbonate.

Chronic inflammation leads to multifocal atrophic gastritis and a reduction in the number of acid-producing @parietal cells@, which are located mostly in the gastric body.

Autoimmune gastritis is characterized by autoantibodies against gastric parietal cells leading to inflammation of the gastric mucosa, parietal cell destruction, and achlorhydria.  Its etiology is at least partially genetic. $ Educational objective Helicobacter pylori antral gastritis is associated with the formation of duodenal ulcers due to increased gastric acid production.

  "explanation_2": "$Liver neoplasms are most often due to #metastases# from distant tumors rather than primary liver cancer (eg, hepatocellular carcinoma).  Metastatic disease to the liver is particularly likely when #multiple tumors# are present (as seen in this case) and there is no history of underlying hepatic disease such as alcohol-induced cirrhosis or hepatitis C.  The liver is vulnerable to the metastatic spread of cancer due to the following anatomic considerations: $ • The presence of #fenestrated hepatic sinusoidal epithelium#, which allows tumor cells to easily pass from the bloodstream through to the parenchyma.$ • #Dual blood supply# from the portal and systemic circulation, which increases the likelihood of circulating tumor cells depositing in the liver. $ The most common cause of liver metastases is #colorectal cancer#, which spreads directly from the colon or superior rectum through the #portal venous system# to the liver.  This patient, who has not received recommended cancer screening (eg, colonoscopy), likely developed hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer.  Gastric and pancreatic cancers also frequently spread through the portal system to the liver. $ (Choice A)  Lymphatic spread of tumor cells is a common mechanism of metastases, but it is not the primary source of most metastatic liver lesions. $ (Choice B)  Tumors (eg, breast, lung, melanoma) can spread to the liver through the systemic circulation via the hepatic artery (rather than the portal circulation).  The hepatic vein drains out of the liver; it does not bring blood into the liver. $ (Choice D)  Primary hepatic cancer is thirtyfold less common than metastatic disease.  Most primary lesions are solitary tumors and arise in individuals with underlying liver disease.  This patient, who did not have recommended cancer screening (eg, colonoscopy) and has multiple liver tumors, most likely has metastatic disease. $ (Choice E)  Although gastrointestinal cancers can spread to the peritoneum and then invade the liver, this is much less common than hematogenous dissemination through the portal system.  Metastasis through the peritoneal space most commonly occurs with ovarian cancer and gastric (Krukenberg) tumors. $ Educational objective Most hepatic neoplasms are due to metastatic disease from a distant site.  Colorectal cancer is the most common cause of hepatic metastases due to direct blood flow from the colon (and superior rectum) to the liver via the portal venous circulation."

Physiologic breakdown of these RBCs causes excess production of indirect bilirubin. $ • ↓ #Bilirubin clearance#:  Physiologically #decreased# levels of hepatic uridine diphosphogluconurate #(UDP) glucuronosyltransferase# in newborns results in decreased bilirubin conjugation and excretion into the bile. $ •↑ #Enterohepatic circulation:#  Normally, bilirubin in the intestines is reduced by bacterial enzymes to allow for excretion through urine and stool.  In the newborn, lack of bacterial enzymes due to relative gut sterility results in an increased bilirubin concentration remaining in the intestines.  This excess bilirubin is deconjugated by intestinal beta-glucuronidase and then reabsorbed via the enterohepatic circulation #(choice B)#. $ Benign neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is typically asymptomatic except for scleral icterus and @jaundice@.

Moreover, once the patient is symptomatic, transaminases would be elevated. $ (Choice C)  @Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency@ can present with jaundice and indirect hyperbilirubinemia in the early neonatal period.  However, because hemolysis contributes to the pathophysiology of jaundice in this condition, the hematocrit would be decreased and the reticulocyte count would be elevated. $ (Choice E)  @Biliary atresia@ is characterized by fibrous obliteration of the extrahepatic biliary tree and typically presents with jaundice in the first 2 months of life.  However, direct bilirubin is elevated due to biliary tract obstruction.  In addition, patients often have acholic stools and dark urine. $ Educational objective Benign neonatal hyperbilirubinemia presents with jaundice and elevated indirect bilirubin levels that peak at age 2-5 days.  Pathophysiology includes impaired bilirubin clearance by the liver due to decreased hepatic UDP glucuronosyltransferase, an enzyme responsible for bilirubin conjugation.",

Patients with this disorder develop hundreds or thousands of #colonic polyps# in the second or third decade of life.  These polyps behave similarly to colonic polyps that form in patients who do not have FAP (spontaneous polyps): they typically grow over time, do not regress, and are associated with a progressive risk for high-grade dysplasia and transformation to invasive cancer as they enlarge.  Because patients with FAP have innumerable polyps, the risk that one or more will transform into invasive #colonic carcinoma is nearly 100%#. Therefore, colectomy is generally recommended. $ FAP is caused by a germline mutation to the tumor suppressor gene #adenomatous polyposis coli# (APC).  The APC gene encodes for a protein that destroys beta-catenin.  Loss of the APC protein results in elevated beta-catenin levels, which stimulates a transcriptional activator that leads to proliferation of intestinal crypt cells (and the subsequent formation of polyps).  Patients may also have extracolonic manifestations such as gastric or duodenal polyps, desmoid tumors, and brain cancer, but these manifestations have lower penetrance than colonic polyps. $ Loss of control of the APC pathway is a crucial first step in the development of both hereditary and sporadic forms of colon cancer.  Nearly 80% of sporadic colon cancers have somatic mutations to both APC alleles; the remainder usually have activating mutations to the downstream products of this pathway. $ Educational objective Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by germline mutation to the tumor suppressor gene adenomatous polyposis coli.

They tend to develop in patients age >50 as a result of mutations in the APC tumor suppressor gene, which regulates cell growth and adhesion.  Progression to adenocarcinoma proceeds as other mutations occur in genes such as KRAS and TP53.  This accumulation of gene mutations is called the \"#adenoma-to-carcinoma sequence#.\" $ Increased activity of the enzyme #cyclooxygenase-2# (COX-2) has been found in many forms of colon adenocarcinoma and in inherited polyposes syndromes.  This may be due to the need for COX-induced prostaglandin production, which leads to epithelial proliferation.  Regular #aspirin# (a COX inhibitor) intake has been associated with lower rates of colonic adenoma and adenocarcinoma, although this must be balanced against bleeding risk. $ (Choice A)  Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which plays an important role in hypertension and congestive heart failure.  ACE inhibitors are widely used to treat these conditions. $ (Choice B)  Caspases are cysteine proteases that are an essential component in cellular apoptosis.  Inhibition of caspase activity would lead to cells that are resistant to apoptosis; this is one of the mechanisms involved in the progression of the adenoma-to-carcinoma sequence. $ #(Choices D and E)#  Glutamate dehydrogenase (produces ammonia for use in the urea cycle) and phenylalanine hydroxylase (converts phenylalanine to tyrosine) have not been implicated in the development of adenomatous polyps. $ (Choice F)  Xanthine oxidase is an enzyme that participates in uric acid synthesis.  Allopurinol is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor used to lower serum levels of uric acid in gout and tumor lysis syndrome. $ Educational objective Adenomatous polyps contain dysplastic mucosa and are premalignant.  Regular screening with timely excision of polyps is effective for prevention of colon adenocarcinoma.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient with recurrent abdominal pain and diarrhea likely has #Crohn disease# (CD) complicated by small-bowel obstruction.  CD is an inflammatory bowel disease that occurs most commonly in young adults.  It typically presents as recurrent episodes of abdominal pain associated with diarrhea, low-grade fevers, and fatigue; symptoms may worsen during periods of stress.  The inflammation can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from the mouth to the anus and is typically patchy with interspersed areas of normal bowel (skip lesions).  CD is characterized by #transmural inflammation# (all layers of the bowel wall are involved), which predisposes to several complications: $ • #Strictures# occur as a result of bowel wall edema, fibrosis, and #hypertrophy (thickening)# of the @muscularis mucosae@, which narrows the intestinal lumen.  This can progress  to #bowel obstruction#. $ • Fistulas occur when ulcers penetrate the entire thickness of the intestinal wall, leading to a sinus tract that communicates between multiple organs (eg, enterovesicular, enterovaginal, enteroenteric). $ • @Abscesses@ form when sinus tracts become walled off.  They can also perforate, leading to diffuse peritonitis. $ (Choice A)  Caseating granulomas are typically seen in multiple infectious processes, most notably tuberculosis (TB).  Abdominal TB can present with abdominal pain, fevers, and occasional obstruction; however, symptoms are unlikely to spontaneously wax and wane, and evidence of TB is often present in other sites (eg, hemoptysis with pulmonary TB).  CD is associated with noncaseating, rather than caseating, granulomas. $ (Choice B)  Flask-shaped ulcers in the cecum and colon are seen in Entamoeba histolytica infection, which occurs more commonly in developing countries and presents with bloody diarrhea.  Severe cases can cause fulminant colitis with bowel necrosis, but obstruction is uncommon. $ (Choice C)  Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory bowel disease that involves only the mucosa and submucosa.  Inflammation involves contiguous areas of the colon only, and the small bowel is not involved.  Due to the superficial nature of the inflammation, strictures and fistulas are not seen. $ (Choice D)  @Pseudomembranes@ composed of fibrin and inflammatory debris are seen with Clostridium difficile infection, which is typically associated with antibiotic use.  Complications include toxic megacolon; however, C difficile does not cause obstruction and the small bowel is not typically involved. $ Educational objective Crohn disease is characterized by patchy, transmural inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract.

Gallstones typically affect middle-aged and older patients (particularly women) unless there is a predisposing condition (eg, young patients with sickle cell disease are at increased risk for bilirubin gallstones).  This young male patient does not consume #alcohol# and is unlikely to have #gallstones#, especially considering the negative results of his prior ultrasound.  Thus, one of the following #less common causes# of acute pancreatitis likely accounts for his condition: $ 1. Recent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedure $ 2.  Drugs (eg, azathioprine, sulfasalazine, furosemide, valproic acid) $3. Infections (eg, mumps, Coxsackie virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae) $4. #Hypertriglyceridemia# $ 5. Structural abnormalities of the pancreatic duct (strictures, cancer, pancreas divisum) or of the ampullary region (choledochal cyst, stenosis of sphincter of Oddi) $ 6.  Surgery (particularly of the stomach and biliary tract and after cardiac surgery) $ 7. Hypercalcemia$ High levels of circulating triglycerides lead to increased production of free fatty acids within the pancreatic capillaries by pancreatic lipase.  Normally, fatty acids exist in serum bound to albumin.  However, if serum #triglyceride levels rise to >1000 mg/dL#, the concentration of free fatty acids exceeds the binding capacity of albumin and leads to direct injury to the pancreatic acinar cells.  Thus, hypertriglyceridemia causes acute pancreatitis via direct tissue toxicity. $ (Choice A)  Decreased serum ceruloplasmin and increased hepatic copper content are diagnostic of Wilson disease.  Cirrhosis, central nervous system involvement, and Kayser-Fleischer rings are characteristic findings.  Wilson disease does not predispose to acute pancreatitis. $ (Choice B)  Increased serum cholesterol levels predispose to the development of systemic atherosclerosis, putting patients at increased risk for coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and stroke.  In some cases, hypercholesterolemia may increase the risk of cholesterol gallstone formation, but this patient's negative gallbladder ultrasound makes this a less likely cause of his pancreatitis. $ (Choice C)  High concentrations of serum ferritin are found in hemochromatosis.  Hemochromatosis can cause cirrhosis, pancreatic fibrosis and subsequent diabetes, cardiomyopathy, and secondary hypogonadism.  It does not cause acute pancreatitis. $ (Choice E)  Hyperuricemia can lead to the formation of uric acid renal calculi and urate nephropathy.  There is no association with acute pancreatitis. $ (Choice F)  Increased concentrations of oxalate in the urine are associated with intestinal malabsorption syndromes (eg, Crohn disease).  Calcium oxalate renal stones may form as a result.  Hyperoxaluria is not associated with acute pancreatitis. $ Educational objective Eighty percent of acute pancreatitis cases are caused by gallstones and chronic alcoholism.  Less common causes account for the other 20%.  Inherited or acquired hypertriglyceridemia can cause acute pancreatitis if the serum level of triglycerides exceeds 1000 mg/dL."

The risk increases with age (particularly in those age ≥60). $ Patients commonly present with constant #abdominal pain#, classically in the #left lower quadrant#, signifying sigmoid colon involvement.  Other symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and changes in bowel habits (constipation or diarrhea).

Bone and liver are the primary sources of alkaline phosphatase, with threefold elevations considered a relatively nonspecific finding for many liver diseases.  To clarify the importance of a moderately elevated alkaline phosphatase, the hepatic γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP) should be evaluated. $ γ-glutamyl transpeptidase is an enzyme predominantly present in hepatocytes and biliary epithelia.  While it too can be found in various extrahepatic tissues (organs such as kidney, spleen, pancreas, heart, lung, and brain), GGTP is not present to a significant extent in bone.  It is therefore particularly useful in determining whether an elevated alkaline phosphatase is of hepatic or bony origin. $ (Choice A)  Measurement of unconjugated bilirubin (especially in contrast to conjugated bilirubin) can be of assistance in distinguishing hemolytic conditions from hepatic dysfunction or bile duct obstruction.  This test is not particularly helpful in following up an elevated alkaline phosphatase. $ (Choice B)  Lactate dehydrogenase is a relatively nonspecific test that can be of some assistance in the evaluation of tissue injury or death.

  "explanation_2": "This patient's pathologic features are consistent with #hepatocellular adenoma# (HCA), an uncommon benign liver tumor found predominantly in #young women#. It is associated with #estrogen# exposure (eg, oral contraceptive pills), anabolic steroid use, and obesity.  Pathogenesis is thought to be hormonally mediated but is not fully understood. $ Macroscopically, HCA is typically a @well-circumscribed@, solid, #solitary, unencapsulated# mass arising in the right lobe.  The cut surface is often soft and tan with areas of hemorrhage and necrosis.  Histologically, HCA is composed of sheets or plates of #benign hepatocytes#.  Cells may be larger than normal hepatocytes but have small, @uniform nuclei@ (ie, no cytologic atypia) and rare mitoses. @Normal hepatic architecture@ is absent; instead, there are prominent arteries without normal portal tracts or interlobular bile ducts.  The uninvolved liver is usually noncirrhotic. $ Patients may be asymptomatic (ie, diagnosed incidentally by imaging) or have epigastric or #right upper quadrant pain# (due to hepatomegaly or intralesional bleeding or necrosis).  Because HCA is an unencapsulated and vascular lesion, there is #risk for rupture# with life-threatening intraabdominal bleeding (eg, severe abdominal pain, hypotension).  For this reason, large or symptomatic HCAs are usually surgically resected. $ (Choice A) @Focal nodular hyperplasia@, a nonneoplastic liver lesion, occurs primarily in young women.  Although typically a well-circumscribed, solitary mass, it characteristically has a central stellate scar. $ (Choice C)  @Hepatocellular carcinoma@ (HCC) typically arises in older patients with underlying liver disease and cirrhosis.  The macroscopic appearance can vary, but histopathology often shows @atypical hepatocytes@ with increased mitoses.  Although malignant transformation of HCA occasionally occurs, this patient's histopathology is not suggestive of HCC. $ (Choice D)  @Pyogenic hepatic abscess@ commonly results from biliary tract infection or portal vein pyemia (eg, bowel leakage).  Although it causes abdominal pain, patients are typically febrile.  Pathologic examination often shows a soft, yellow-green, necrotic lesion composed of neutrophils and debris. $ (Choice E)  The liver is a common site of metastasis in patients with a history of malignancy (eg, colorectal).  Histopathology of @metastases@ may resemble that of the primary tumor (eg, atypical epithelial cells forming infiltrative glands); mitoses are common. $ Educational objective Hepatocellular adenomas are benign liver tumors found predominantly in young women with a history of oral contraceptive use.

  "explanation_2": "#Parietal cells# are located in the gastric glands of the fundus and body of the stomach.  They can be spotted easily due to their eosinophilic cytoplasm on H&E stain.  These cells have abundant mitochondria and an intracellular tubulovesicular system that allows them to secrete large quantities of gastric acid (HCl) and intrinsic factor. $ Parietal cells are influenced by a number of substances.  Histamine, acetylcholine, and gastrin increase gastric acid secretion, but prostaglandins inhibit it. #Gastrin# not only stimulates #HCl secretion#, but it also has a #trophic effect# on parietal cells.  In patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (such as this patient), gastrin hypersecretion induces #parietal cell hyperplasia#, causing visible #enlargement of gastric folds# on endoscopy.  The increased gastric acid secretion induced by excess gastrin also causes peptic ulcer disease, heartburn, and diarrhea. $ (Choice A)  Acetylcholine is a universal neurotransmitter that is present in parasympathetic postganglionic synapses and in all autonomic preganglionic synapses.  Cholinergic receptors are divided into muscarinic (located in smooth muscle and glands) and nicotinic (found at the neuromuscular junction).  Acetylcholine stimulates parietal cell acid secretion but is not typically associated with parietal cell hyperplasia or gastric fold enlargement. $ (Choice C)  Secretin is produced by S cells of the small intestine.  It increases bicarbonate production by the pancreas and leads to the secretion of watery, alkaline pancreatic juice.  This substance also inhibits gastric acid secretion and stimulates pyloric sphincter contraction. $ (Choice D)  Serotonin (5HT) is primarily found in enterochromaffin cells of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, the central nervous system, and platelets.  In the GI tract, it helps to regulate intestinal secretions and peristalsis. $ (Choice E)  Somatostatin (growth hormone-inhibiting hormone) is secreted by D cells of pancreatic islets and GI mucosa.  It has multiple inhibitory effects over the GI tract, including decreasing motility, gastrin secretion, pancreatic endocrine/exocrine secretion, and absorption of nutrients. $ (Choice F)  Transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-α) is a potent stimulator of epithelial growth and is secreted by carcinomas, macrophages, and epithelial cells.  Menetrier disease is associated with overproduction of TGF-α, resulting in mucosal-cell hyperplasia with gastric fold enlargement.  However, the condition causes hypoplasia of parietal/chief cells, resulting in glandular atrophy with reduced gastric acid secretion. $ Educational objective Patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome develop peptic ulcer disease and parietal cell hyperplasia with gastric fold enlargement due to gastrin hypersecretion."

These areas of necrosis contrast with the relatively normal-appearing hepatocytes in the periportal regions (zone 1), creating an overall heterogenous appearance sometimes referred to as \"#nutmeg liver#.\" $ In addition to signs and symptoms of right-sided heart failure, patients with congestive hepatopathy may have localized right upper quadrant pain (due to stretching of the hepatic capsule), and laboratory results may demonstrate modest elevations in serum bilirubin and transaminases. $ (Choice A)  Autoimmune destruction of intrahepatic biliary ducts occurs in primary biliary cholangitis (formerly primary biliary cirrhosis).  Because intrahepatic bile ducts are concentrated in the periportal regions, histopathology demonstrates @periductal fibrosis@ predominantly in those regions. $ (Choice B)  Excessive hepatic deposition of iron most commonly occurs due to hemochromatosis.  Patients receiving frequent blood transfusions are also at risk; however, histopathology would demonstrate periportal fibrosis and numerous @brown pigments@ representing iron deposits.  Fibrosis favors the periportal regions likely because those hepatocytes are exposed to the highest concentrations of iron-rich blood coming from the portal vein. $ (Choice C)  Histopathology in chronic viral hepatitis (eg, chronic hepatitis C) reveals dense infiltrate of @mononuclear inflammatory cells@ in the periportal regions; there is often gradual development of periportal fibrosis that may eventually bridge to the centrilobular regions. $ (Choice D)  Histopathology of metastatic spread to the liver is unlikely to demonstrate a consistent pattern of lobular necrosis, but it can reveal an abrupt @demarcation@ between normal hepatocellular tissue and the metastatic tumor. $ Educational objective Congestive hepatopathy is a common complication of right-sided heart failure.  Patchy hemorrhage and necrosis predominantly affect the centrilobular regions (zone 3) where hepatic congestion is most prominent.  The centrilobular necrosis, combined with relatively normal-appearing periportal regions (zone 1), creates an overall heterogenous appearance sometimes referred to as \"nutmeg liver.\"",

  "explanation_2": "$This infant has #pneumatosis intestinalis# (ie, air in the bowel wall), which can be seen on abdominal x-ray as thin curvilinear areas of lucency that parallel the lumen.  In an infant with abdominal distension and bloody stools, this finding is diagnostic for #necrotizing enterocolitis# (NEC). $ NEC is one of the most frequent gastrointestinal emergencies affecting newborns.  It occurs predominantly in #preterm infants# secondary to gastrointestinal and immunologic immaturity.  Upon initiation of enteral feeding, bacteria are introduced into the bowel where they proliferate excessively due to compromised immune clearance.  Impaired mucosal barrier function allows the bacteria to invade the bowel wall, causing inflammation and #ischemic necrosis# of the terminal ileum and colon.  As the disease progresses, the bowel becomes congested and gangrenous with the formation of #intramural gas collections#. $ Up to 30% of affected neonates die, especially when disease is complicated by intestinal perforation.  Survivors are at risk for strictures and #bowel obstruction# secondary to fibrosis that occurs as the inflammation subsides. $ (Choice A)  Duodenal atresia classically presents with the @double bubble sign@ of air in the stomach and proximal duodenal pouch.  Affected infants generally have bilious emesis shortly after birth. $ (Choice B)  Hirschsprung disease manifests with failure to pass meconium in the first 48 hours after birth.  On x-ray, the large intestine appears dilated proximal to the aganglionic portion of bowel; contrast enema will show a narrow-caliber @transition zone@. $ (Choice C)  Malrotation of the bowel occurs when the midgut does not rotate normally during the first trimester, leaving the small and large bowel malpositioned.  Malrotated bowel is at high risk of obstruction and ischemia due to twisting around its blood supply (volvulus).  However, the finding of pneumatosis intestinalis is more specific for necrotizing enterocolitis. $ (Choice E)  Pyloric stenosis is caused by hypertrophy of the pyloric sphincter and leads to gastric outlet obstruction.  It presents with nonbilious vomiting after feeding and a palpable ball of muscle (\"olive\") in the abdomen.  Pyloric stenosis is not associated with bloody stools or pneumatosis intestinalis. $ Educational objective Necrotizing enterocolitis is one of the most common gastrointestinal emergencies affecting newborns.  It is characterized by bacterial invasion and ischemic necrosis of the bowel wall, and is associated with prematurity and initiation of enteral feeding.  Abdominal x-ray showing pneumatosis intestinalis (ie, air in the bowel wall) confirms the diagnosis.",

H pylori infection is also associated with chronic antral-predominant gastritis. $ (Choice E)  Gastric adenocarcinoma can occur as the intestinal subtype (ie, bulky mass composed of glandular structures) or diffuse subtype (ie, gross stomach wall thickening with signet-ring cells on microscopy).  Risk factors for gastric adenocarcinoma include chronic gastritis, cigarette smoking, H pylori infection, and a diet high in salt/nitrosamines. $ Educational objective Stress-related mucosal disease is usually caused by local ischemia in the setting of severe physiologic stress (eg, shock, extensive burns, sepsis, severe trauma).

Chronic infection results in patchy, multifocal, atrophic gastritis with loss of parietal cells and G cells in the gastric body; this is associated with decreased acid secretion and an increased risk of gastric ulcers, gastric adenocarcinoma, and MALT lymphoma.",

WDNETs are derived from #neuroendocrine cells# and often arise in the gastrointestinal tract (eg, small intestine, rectum, appendix). $ Microscopically, WDNETs can show a variety of architectural patterns (eg, islands, nests, trabeculae) and are composed of @uniform tumor cells@ with round nuclei, #salt and pepper chromatin#, and eosinophilic (ie, pink) cytoplasm.  The cytoplasm contains dense-core neurosecretory granules seen using electron microscopy, with secretory products such as vasoactive molecules (eg, #serotonin#) and hormones (eg, gastrin). $ WDNETs are the most common appendiceal tumors and are usually #incidentally found# at the distal tip of the appendix in patients who have undergone appendectomy for unrelated reasons.  However, tumors at the base can obstruct the lumen, causing #appendicitis#.  The majority of appendiceal WDNETs follow an #indolent# clinical course, but larger tumors can metastasize.  In rare cases, metastasis to the liver can result in carcinoid syndrome (eg, flushing, diarrhea, bronchospasm). $ (Choice A)  Endothelial cells can give rise to vascular tumors such as @angiosarcoma@, which typically involves the skin, breast, or liver.

Cholecystitis is inflammation of the gallbladder that usually occurs when gallstones obstruct the cystic duct.  Gallstones form due to supersaturation of bile constituents (eg, cholesterol, bilirubin), which then crystalize out of solution with other bile components (eg, mucin, calcium, proteins) to produce stones. $ #Black gallstones#, as seen in this patient, form due to the #supersaturation of bilirubin#, which precipitates with calcium to form multiple small calcium bilirubinate stones.  Bilirubin supersaturation occurs through the following mechanisms: $ • #Increased bilirubin production:#  Chronic hemolysis, as seen in #sickle cell anemia#, hereditary spherocytosis, and thalassemia, increases circulating levels of free bilirubin, which is taken up by the liver and #excreted into bile#. $ • #Altered enterohepatic circulation# of bilirubin:  Ileal disease (eg, Crohn disease) or resection allows bile acids, which are normally reabsorbed in the ileum, to spill into the colon.  There, bile acids solubilize unconjugated bilirubin, allowing its reabsorption and concentration within the bile #(choice A)#. $ This patient with sickle cell anemia most likely has chronic hemolysis, which has increased bilirubin efflux into the bile, promoting formation of black stones. $ #(Choices B and C)#  Biliary stasis promotes gallstone formation by providing a favorable environment for crystal nucleation and aggregation.

However, stasis usually promotes the formation of yellow cholesterol stones, and this patient did not have prolonged fasting or surgery prior to developing her symptoms. $ (Choice D)  Cirrhosis can also occasionally promote the formation of black stones due to impaired bile acid synthesis and hyperbilirubinemia (due to cholestasis).

Gastrin causes parietal cell hyperplasia and stimulates gastric acid secretion, resulting in the development of #peptic ulcers#, heartburn, and #diarrhea# (excess gastric acid impairs intestinal epithelial cells and digestive enzymes).  Although most proximal duodenal ulcers are caused by Helicobacter pylori infection or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use #(choice E)#, ulcers found #beyond the duodenal bulb# suggest ZES. $ #Secretin# is a hormone released from the duodenum in response to acid and fat in the small intestine.  The hormone increases pancreatic bicarbonate secretion and inhibits the release of gastrin from normal gastric G cells.  However, secretin paradoxically #stimulates gastrin release from gastrinomas# due to abnormal adenylate cyclase activation.  As such, secretin administration can be used to differentiate ZES from other causes of hypergastrinemia (eg, atrophic gastritis). $ (Choice A)  Autoimmune gastritis (chronic atrophic gastritis) involves the body/fundus of the stomach with antral sparing.  CD4+ T cell-mediated parietal cell destruction causes impaired gastric acid and intrinsic factor secretion, resulting in achlorhydria and pernicious anemia, respectively.  Low acid levels stimulate gastrin release from G cells (hypergastrinemia), but secretin administration causes a reduction in gastrin levels. $ (Choice B)  H pylori infection is associated with chronic antral-predominant gastritis, which may lead to a reduction in somatostatin-producing cells (delta cells).  Lack of inhibition by somatostatin allows for excessive gastrin release, which promotes gastric acid hypersecretion and proximal duodenal ulcer formation.  Secretin administration typically causes a reduction in gastrin levels in these patients. $ (Choice C)  Crohn disease is associated with dysregulation of the mucosal immune response, intestinal epithelial dysfunction, and altered composition of gut flora.  Patients characteristically have linear ulcerations with adjacent normal-appearing mucosa (cobblestone appearance) in the small intestine. $ (Choice F)  Stress-related mucosal disease can occur with severe physiologic stress (eg, shock, head trauma, burns), but the association between psychological stress (eg, working as an air traffic controller) and peptic ulcer formation is controversial.  Nonetheless, neither form of stress would cause distal duodenal ulcers and hypergastrinemia. $ Educational objective Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is caused by gastrinomas located in the small intestine/pancreas and presents with peptic ulcers (especially distal duodenal ulcers), heartburn, and diarrhea.

They are most frequently found on the trunk, face, and upper limbs.  Spider angiomata are likely due to #estrogen-induced arteriolar dilation# and are also seen in other hyperestrogenic states (eg, pregnancy).  The number and size of angiomata generally correlate with the severity of liver disease. $ #(Choices A and F)#  Altered mental status and a sweet, sulfurous breath odor (fetor hepaticus) are signs of poor hepatic function and accumulation of metabolic toxins (eg, ammonia, dimethyl sulfide).  In the healthy liver, ammonia is detoxified to urea, which is then excreted in the urine.  In patients with cirrhosis, ammonia accumulates in the blood, resulting in impaired neurotransmission in the CNS and possible brain edema. $ #(Choices B and E)#  Portal hypertension arises from increased hepatic resistance to portal flow at the sinusoids.

Portal hypertension also leads to ascites and venous congestion of the spleen (splenomegaly). $ (Choice C)  The liver is the primary site of protein synthesis.

Once at the basolateral surface, Shigella can more efficiently enter enterocytes and then spread laterally into other epithelial cells without reentering the gut lumen (ie, actin-based motility).  The bacterium also induces macrophage apoptosis, resulting in a massive inflammatory response that causes denuding and ulceration of the mucosa with subsequent #bloody and mucoid# stools. $ (Choice A)  Endothelial cells form the innermost lining of blood vessels.  Shiga toxin produced by Escherichia coli O157:H7 and S dysenteriae, not S sonnei, can cause toxicity to renal endothelial cells, leading to hemolytic uremic syndrome.  However, all Shigella species are transmitted via the fecal-oral route and initiate infection by disrupting the intestinal epithelial barrier. $ (Choice B)  Enteroendocrine cells in the gastrointestinal tract secrete hormones such as somatostatin and cholecystokinin.  They are not involved in the pathogenesis of Shigella infection. $ (Choice C)  Goblet cells secrete mucus into the gut lumen, and mucous release is increased in inflammatory states, including Shigella diarrhea.  However, goblet cells do not uptake bacteria. $ (Choice E)  Paneth cells, which occur in small groups at the base of intestinal crypts, are both phagocytic and secretory, thereby providing first-line immune defense against microorganisms.  They secrete lysozyme (an enzyme that dissolves the cell walls of many bacteria) and defensins (polypeptides with antimicrobial properties) but do not uptake Shigella. $ Educational objective Shigella initially invades the intestinal epithelial barrier by passing through microfold (M) cells overlying ileal Peyer patches.  Once at the basolateral mucosal surface, Shigella can more efficiently enter enterocytes and then spread laterally into other epithelial cells, causing cell death and ulceration with bloody/mucoid diarrhea."

HD is a congenital disorder in which #neural crest cells# fail to migrate to the bowel wall during embryogenesis.  These cells normally develop into ganglion cells of the #submucosal (Meissner) and myenteric (Auerbach) plexus#.  In HD, the affected colon lacks parasympathetic ganglia and is therefore unable to relax.  Because the neural crest cells migrate caudally along the bowel, the #rectosigmoid area# is most commonly involved. $ Typical presentation is in the neonatal period with delayed passage of meconium and signs of bowel obstruction (eg, bilious emesis, abdominal distension).  However, disease severity correlates with the length of nonfunctional bowel.  Therefore, those with a short aganglionic segment may go undiagnosed with chronic, refractory #constipation# for months or years, as in this case.  Characteristic findings on @contrast enema@ include a narrowed rectosigmoid area (due to chronic contraction) and a dilated bowel proximal to the obstruction. $ Rectal suction biopsy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of HD and should include the #submucosa# of the rectum (ie, #narrowed segment#), which is the most superficial layer that demonstrates the #absence of ganglion cells# (ie, submucosal plexus).

Decreased bile acid resorption at the ileum (eg, due to Crohn disease) also promotes cholesterol concentration. $ Increased calcium or mucin concentration:  Rapid weight loss (eg, gastric bypass) promotes increased calcium and mucin concentrations in the bile, which trap cholesterol crystals and promote stone formation. $ #(Choices A and E)#  Increased enterohepatic cycling of bilirubin occurs with ileal disease (eg, Crohn disease), as the loss of bile acids promotes reabsorption of unconjugated bilirubin.

The colon receives blood from the marginal artery of the colon (artery of Drummond), an anastomotic system of arteries that is in turn supplied by the superior (SMA) and inferior (IMA) mesenteric artery systems.  The distal colon receives blood also from the internal iliac artery. $ In low-flow states, as may be seen in severe hypotension in patients with underlying arterial insufficiency (eg, diabetes, atherosclerotic arterial disease), #nonocclusive ischemia# may occur at the margins of the anastomotic distributions.  These #\"watershed\"# areas are primarily in the left colon at the #splenic flexure# (border between SMA and IMA supply) and #rectosigmoid junction# (border between sigmoid artery and superior rectal artery).  Less commonly, #occlusive ischemia# can also be caused by thromboembolic (eg, hypercoagulable states, atrial fibrillation) or atheroembolic (eg, aortic instrumentation) events. $ Impaired perfusion to the bowel leads to ischemia and necrosis of the intestinal wall.  Complications can include acidosis, sepsis, gangrene, and perforation.  Colonoscopy will reveal pale mucosa and petechial hemorrhages. $ #(Choices A, B, C, and E)#  The ascending colon, cecum, hepatic flexure, and most of the transverse colon are supplied by branches of the SMA.  Mesenteric ischemia in these areas is significantly less common than in the watershed areas of the left colon.  Ischemia is also uncommon in the rectum, which receives collateral blood supply via the rectal arteries. $Educational objective The splenic flexure and rectosigmoid junction lie between regions of perfusion of major arteries.

  "explanation_2": "This patient has @clinical findings@ consistent with alcohol-induced cirrhosis, namely signs of portal hypertension (ascites/caput medusa) and hepatic encephalopathy (asterixis).  Alcohol-associated hepatic injury evolves through the stages of steatosis (reversible), hepatitis (reversible), and cirrhosis (irreversible). $ Laboratory findings in cirrhosis reflect both hepatocellular/biliary injury and loss of hepatic function.  Hepatocyte injury causes a release of intracellular enzymes and an increase in serum transaminases; biliary injury is reflected by increases in alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT).  Although these laboratory studies are indicative of ongoing hepatobiliary injury, they do not provide information on the liver's functional reserve, a key determinant of prognosis in patients with cirrhosis.  Serum albumin levels and prothrombin time (PT) are better indicators of the liver's biosynthetic function, and its ability to transport and metabolize organic anions is reflected by the serum bilirubin level.  Hypoalbuminemia, elevated bilirubin levels, and prolonged PT are signs of inadequate liver function (eg, liver failure) and indicate a poor prognosis in cirrhotic patients.  For this reason, they are included in multiple scoring systems used to assess the severity of liver failure and need for transplantation. $ (Choice A)  A high aspartate aminotransferase (AST) indicates hepatocellular injury and release of intracellular enzymes into the blood.  AST is classically elevated to more than 2 times the level of alanine aminotransferase in alcohol-associated liver disease.  Transaminase elevations do not reflect liver function and do not predict outcomes; these enzymes can be transiently elevated by a number of self-limited processes. $ (Choice B)  Fibrinogen is a coagulation factor and an acute phase protein.  Liver fibrinogen synthesis is increased in response to infection or acute inflammation and diminished in liver failure.  Therefore, low fibrinogen levels would be expected in liver failure. $ (Choice C)  When the alkaline phosphatase is elevated, serum GGT measurements can differentiate whether the cause is biliary disease or an alternate cause such as bone disease.  GGT elevations are more specific for biliary injury. $ (Choice D)  The bleeding time is a measure of platelet function (not liver synthetic function) and is often prolonged in severe alcohol-related liver disease, although with a fair degree of variance.  Thrombocytopenia develops with chronic alcohol use due to both direct toxic effects of alcohol on the bone marrow as well as splenic sequestration of platelets. $ Educational objective Increased aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase are indicators of hepatocellular damage, and increased alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase indicate biliary injury.  Serum albumin levels, bilirubin levels, and prothrombin time are reflective of liver function and are of greatest prognostic significance in patients with cirrhosis.",

Hypertrophy of the circular layer of @smooth muscle@ that surrounds the pylorus obstructs the gastric outlet and impedes the passage of gastric contents, resulting in nonbilious, projectile emesis.  Vomiting usually occurs immediately after oral intake, and infants classically show signs of hunger soon after emesis.  The etiology of this abnormal postnatal #growth of smooth muscle# is likely multifactorial, involving the interplay of genetic factors (eg, positive family history) with environmental exposures (eg, macrolide antibiotics). $ If the diagnosis is delayed, protracted vomiting can result in hypochloremic #metabolic alkalosis# because of the  loss of hydrochloric acid in the emesis.  In addition, hypovolemia activates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and aldosterone stimulates potassium excretion by the kidneys, resulting in hypokalemia.  #Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia# is also commonly seen due to dehydration, which increases enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin. $ Examination of patients with infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis often reveals palpation of the hypertrophied muscle as an #olive-shaped abdominal mass# in the epigastrium, although its absence does not exclude the diagnosis.  Visually #prominent peristaltic waves# may be seen and represent exaggerated gastric contractions attempting to move food beyond the obstruction.  A thick, elongated pylorus visualized with abdominal ultrasonography is diagnostic, and pyloromyotomy is the definitive treatment. $ (Choice B)  Midgut malrotation is a defect in the normal rotation of the midgut around the superior mesenteric artery in early gestation and can lead to volvulus of the small intestine.  Although vomiting commonly occurs, the emesis is typically bilious, and infants are usually ill-appearing and hemodynamically unstable. $ #(Choices C and E)#  Biliary cysts and biliary atresia (fibrous obliteration of the extrahepatic bile ducts) cause jaundice due to direct (conjugated) hyperbilirubinemia, which is not present in this patient.  Moreover, these conditions do not typically cause vomiting. $ (Choice D)  Intestinal atresia is caused by disruption of mesenteric blood vessels during embryologic development, leading to ischemic necrosis and resorption of the fetal bowel.  Vomiting is a common presenting symptom, but it occurs within 48 hours of birth and the emesis is bilious. $ Educational objective Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis is characterized by smooth muscle overgrowth of the pylorus.

  "explanation_2": "$#Helicobacter pylori# infection is a common cause of #peptic ulcers#.  Biopsy specimens are often obtained during endoscopy for direct tissue diagnosis.  In contrast to the time-intensive task of culturing the bacteria, the rapid urease test can be used to quickly diagnose an active infection. $ The rapid urease test is an indirect test for H pylori based on bacterial production of the enzyme #urease#, which splits gastric #urea into ammonia# and CO2.  In vivo, this process increases local pH and facilitates bacterial survival in the acidic stomach environment.  During the test, biopsy specimens are exposed to a solution containing urea and a pH indicator such as phenol red, which changes color from yellow to pink at alkaline pH.  A color change indicates the presence of bacterial urease and confirms active H pylori infection. $ (Choice A)  Gastric adenocarcinoma (ie, clonal proliferation of glandular cells) can present as a gastric ulcer; therefore, gastric ulcers should be biopsied to rule out malignancy.  However, specimens from malignant ulcers do not cause a color change on rapid urease testing. $ (Choice B)  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (eg, aspirin, ibuprofen) are another common cause of peptic ulcers due to their inhibition of the enzyme cyclooxygenase, which is responsible for the synthesis of gastroprotective prostaglandins.  However, urease would not be present in an NSAID-induced ulcer. $ (Choice D)  In Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, gastrin hypersecretion leads to overproduction of gastric acid and formation of peptic ulcers.  In the human body, H pylori also appears to induce acid production (eg, gastrin hypersecretion); however, the urease test detects bacterial urease, which causes the color change (ie, pH rise is from ammonia generation). $ (Choice E)  Autoimmune gastritis is due to T-cell–mediated destruction of parietal cells.  Patients are typically asymptomatic, but prolonged disease leads to pernicious anemia (B12 deficiency due to intrinsic factor destruction) characterized by megaloblastic anemia and neurologic dysfunction.  Gastric pH is increased due to loss of parietal cells, but ulcers do not occur in this condition, and the urease test would be negative. $ Educational objective Helicobacter pylori produces the enzyme urease, which splits urea into CO2 and ammonia and neutralizes the local acidic gastric pH.  Active infection can be confirmed through rapid urease testing, in which a biopsy specimen of gastric mucosa is evaluated in the presence of urea and a pH indicator.  Evidence of alkalization (due to ammonia formation) confirms the diagnosis."

These proteinaceous secretions can precipitate within the pancreatic ducts, forming #ductal plugs# that may #calcify# and be detectable on @abdominal imaging@. $ Ductal obstruction by such concretions may cause #exocrine insufficiency# due to atrophy of the pancreatic acinar cells and pancreatic fibrosis.  Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (eg, failure to secrete adequate amylases, proteases, and lipases) leads to #malabsorption# with consequent #diarrhea/steatorrhea#.  #Weight loss# and bulky, frothy stools are typical clinical findings.  This patient's abdominal pain is most likely due to the pancreatitis itself. $ (Choice A)  Bile salt malabsorption typically occurs with conditions affecting the terminal ileum (eg, ileal resection, Crohn ileitis).  Patients may have diarrhea as a result of excessive bile salt accumulation in the colon (cholerheic enteropathy). $ (Choice C)  Portal hypertension (eg, due to liver cirrhosis) causes varices at sites of portocaval anastomoses, leading to anorectal varices, caput medusae over the abdomen, and esophageal varices.  Bleeding esophageal varices can cause hematemesis and melena.  Ascites is another sign of portal hypertension. $ (Choice D)  Gastrinomas (duodenal/pancreatic gastrin-secreting neuroendocrine tumors) cause hydrochloric acid hypersecretion, which can result in multiple and/or refractory peptic ulcers.  Patients may also have diarrhea/malabsorption as digestive enzymes become deactivated by high gastric acid output. $ (Choice E)  Celiac disease classically presents with malabsorption due to immune-mediated enteropathy involving the proximal small intestine.  This condition is triggered by the ingestion of foods containing gluten (eg, wheat). $ (Choice F)  Chronic alcohol use may result in the interference of nutrient/vitamin absorption due to intestinal mucosal injury.  However, this patient's abdominal pain and epigastric calcifications suggest that his diarrhea is most likely a consequence of chronic pancreatitis. $ Educational objective Diarrhea, weight loss, and epigastric calcifications in a patient with chronic alcohol use suggest chronic pancreatitis with resulting pancreatic exocrine insufficiency and malabsorption.",

In DES, several segments of the esophagus contract inappropriately at the same time, which appears as disorganized #non-peristaltic contractions# on esophageal manometry and \"corkscrew\" esophagus on barium esophagogram.  Because the food bolus is inefficiently propelled toward the stomach, patients typically present with intermittent #solid/liquid dysphagia, chest pain#, heartburn, and food regurgitation.  The pathogenesis of DES likely involves #impaired inhibitory neurotransmission# within the esophageal myenteric plexus. $ (Choice A)  Patients with sliding hiatal hernia often develop symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux (eg, heartburn, regurgitation, dysphagia) due to anatomic disruption of the gastroesophageal junction and impaired esophageal acid clearance.

Spinocerebellar tract degeneration causes #ataxia#, and peripheral nerve dysfunction results in motor and sensory loss and #hyporeflexia#.  Skeletal myopathy can also contribute to muscle weakness. $ • Hemolysis:  Erythrocyte fragility and a shortened red blood cell lifespan result in #hemolytic anemia#, which can present with fatigue, as seen in this patient. $ #(Choices A, B, and C)#  Niacin (vitamin B3), riboflavin (vitamin B2), and thiamine (vitamin B1) are water soluble and unaffected by fat malabsorption, making deficiency unlikely in this patient who has risk factors for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.  Moreover, the clinical findings of these vitamin deficiencies are inconsistent with this patient's presentation: Niacin deficiency causes pellagra (eg, dermatitis, diarrhea, dementia), riboflavin deficiency manifests with a normocytic anemia and mucosal changes (eg, stomatitis, cheilitis, glossitis), and thiamine deficiency is characterized by beriberi and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. $ (Choice D)  In contrast to this patient's presentation, vitamin A deficiency manifests with night blindness, dry eyes (xerophthalmia), and hyperkeratosis (thickened, dry skin). $ (Choice F)  Vitamin K is necessary for hepatic synthesis of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X.  Deficiency presents with easy bleeding and bruising, not seen in this patient. $ Educational objective Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin, and deficiency can occur in individuals with fat malabsorption due to recurrent pancreatitis.  Vitamin E deficiency is associated with increased susceptibility of the neuronal and erythrocyte membranes to oxidative stress.  Clinical manifestations include decreased proprioception, ataxia, peripheral neuropathy (eg, hyporeflexia), and hemolytic anemia."

Intestinal hypoperfusion, which can be very painful, is especially pronounced within an hour after meals when more blood is needed for the digestion/absorption of nutrients (intestinal angina).  This is #analogous to stable cardiac angina#, chest pain that occurs with physical exertion due to increased myocardial oxygen demand.  The diagnosis can be made with duplex ultrasonography or angiography showing high-grade stenosis in the celiac and mesenteric arteries. $ (Choice A)  Aortic dissection results from an aortic intimal tear with formation of a false lumen that can propagate and obstruct the vessels branching off the aorta (eg, renal, splanchnic, spinal, lower limb).  A similar process would be more likely to cause acute end-organ damage (eg, cerebral infarction) rather than chronic, episodic ischemia. $ (Choice B)  Diffuse esophageal spasm is a motility disorder characterized by episodic, painful, non-propulsive esophageal smooth muscle contraction.  Biliary colic is similar to esophageal spasm in that gallbladder contraction against an obstructed cystic duct results in postprandial epigastric pain. $ (Choice C)  Peptic ulcer disease is characterized by gastrointestinal erosions/ulcerations and is typically due to #Helicobacter pylori# infection or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use.  This patient's pain did not respond to antacids and his upper endoscopy is normal, so he is unlikely to have a condition associated with peptic ulcers. $ (Choice D)  Pulmonary embolism is often due to an embolic blood clot lodging in the branches of the pulmonary artery, resulting in acute pulmonary ischemia/infarction.  A similar pathogenesis accounts for acute mesenteric ischemia, which can occur with superior mesenteric artery embolism.  This condition is more likely to cause sudden, severe abdominal pain rather than recurrent postprandial abdominal pain with food aversion. $ Educational objective Chronic mesenteric ischemia is characterized by atherosclerosis of the mesenteric arteries, resulting in diminished blood flow to the intestine after meals.

  "explanation_2": "$The slide above shows normal intestinal mucosal architecture, but the enterocytes contain #clear or foamy cytoplasm# which is more prominent at the tips of the villi.  These findings occur due to #accumulation of lipids# in the absorptive cells of the intestinal epithelium and are typical of #abetalipoproteinemia#, a disease caused by impaired formation of apolipoprotein B (apoB)-containing lipoproteins. $ Dietary lipids are normally processed in small-bowel enterocytes and secreted as chylomicrons; endogenously produced lipids are secreted from hepatocytes as very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL).  Chylomicron and VLDL particles are synthesized within the endoplasmic reticulum as lipids accumulate around apolipoprotein B (ApoB).  ApoB-100 is found in VLDL, and apoB-48 (a truncated version without the LDL receptor ligand) is present in chylomicrons.  During the synthesis of apoB-containing lipoproteins, #microsomal triglyceride transfer protein# (MTP) functions as a chaperone protein necessary for proper folding of apoB and also participates in the transfer of lipids to newly formed chylomicrons and VLDL particles. $ Abetalipoproteinemia is most commonly caused by an autosomal recessive, #loss-of-function mutation#in the #MTP gene#.  It manifests during the first year of life with symptoms of #malabsorption# (eg, abdominal distention, foul-smelling stool).  Laboratory studies show very low plasma triglyceride and cholesterol levels; chylomicrons, VLDLs, and apoB are entirely absent from the blood.  Poor lipid absorption causes deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins (particularly vitamin E) and essential fatty acids.

Pain is often relieved with bowel movements.  IBS is not an inflammatory condition and does not cause fistulas. $ (Choice E)  Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory disease of the colonic mucosa that almost always affects the rectum and often presents with grossly bloody stool.

Because no cell contents are leaked into the surrounding tissue, there is no associated inflammation. $ The process of apoptosis is separated into an initiation phase and an execution phase.  During the initiation phase, protein-hydrolyzing caspases are activated.  In the execution phase, these caspases bring about the cell death by cleaving cellular proteins and activating DNAses. $ The initiation of apoptosis occurs via signals from two separate pathways: the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway and the extrinsic (death receptor) pathway.  In the intrinsic pathway, the mitochondria become more permeable and pro-apoptotic substances are released into the cytoplasm in response to stress or the cessation of survival signals.  Once the cell is exposed to stress or the cessation of survival signals, the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-x that reside in the mitochondrial membranes and cytoplasm are replaced with pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bak, Bax, and Bim.  The pro-apoptotic proteins allow for the increased permeability of the mitochondria, which results in the release of caspase-activating substances like cytochrome c. $ (Choice A) Hemosiderin accumulation is common in patients who have hemolytic anemia or who undergo frequent blood transfusions.  It is not associated with apoptosis. $ (Choice B) The extrinsic pathway requires engagement of death receptors on the cell surface.  These death receptors are in the tumor necrosis factor receptor family, with the type 1 TNF receptor (TNFR1) and a related protein named Fas (CD95) the two best known members of this family.  After cross-linkage of Fas with its ligand, multiple molecules of Fas come together to form a binding site for a death-domain containing adapter protein called FADD.  FADD then binds an inactive form of a caspase, again bringing multiple caspase proteins together that through a cascade effect eventually induce caspase activation. $ (Choice D) Succinate dehydrogenase is a mitochondrial enzyme in the electron transport chain that acts by oxidizing succinate into fumarate and reducing FAD to FADH2.  This enzyme is not involved in apoptosis. $ (Choice E) Superoxide dismutase catalyzes the reduction of superoxide anions to hydrogen peroxide.  This enzyme is not involved in apoptosis. $ (Choice F) Lipoxygenase plays a key role in the synthesis of leukotrienes, a class of inflammatory mediators. $ Educational Objective Cytochrome c is a mitochondrial enzyme that activates caspases and indirectly brings about cell death through intrinsic pathway apoptosis."

On average, 10 years are required for malignant transformation of adenoma; therefore, early detection and excision of adenomatous polyps can help prevent colon adenocarcinoma.  Features that impact the malignant potential of adenomatous polyps include #size# (<1 cm, unlikely to undergo malignant transformation; >4 cm, 40% risk of malignancy), histologic appearance (#villous# more prone to malignant transformation than tubular), and degree of dysplasia. $ Transformation of normal mucosal cells into malignant ones is caused by a series of gene mutations called the #adenoma to carcinoma sequence#: $ 1. #Progression from normal mucosa to a small adenomatous polyp (adenoma)#.  The initial appearance of small adenomatous polyps is attributed to mutation of the APC tumor suppressor gene. $ 2. #Increase in the size of the adenoma#.  Mutation of the KRAS protooncogene is thought to facilitate this step (going from a small early to a large late adenoma, as with this patient) by leading to #uncontrolled cell proliferation#.  Normally, KRAS encodes for a G protein-like protein that regulates the cell cycle by stimulating and inhibiting it as necessary.  Mutation of KRAS into its oncogene form leads to a constitutively activated GTP-bound protein. $ 3. #Malignant transformation# of adenoma into carcinoma.  This step requires mutation of #TP53#, a tumor suppressor gene that regulates the cell cycle and promotes repair of damaged DNA; mutations are found in most colon carcinomas but rarely in adenomas #(choice E)#. $ (Choice A)  Mutations in the tumor suppressor gene BRCA are classically associated with breast and ovarian cancers. $ (Choice B)  Cyclin D is a protein (encoded by CCND1) that regulates cell cycle.  Its overexpression is seen in breast, lung, and esophageal cancers and certain types of lymphomas. $ (Choice D)  An increased number of copies (amplification) of the NMYC oncogene are seen in neuroblastoma. $ (Choice F)  Mutation of WT1, a tumor suppressor gene, leads to the development of Wilms tumor. $ Educational objective The size of adenomatous polyps determines their malignant potential.  Adenomas <1 cm are unlikely to undergo malignant transformation, whereas those >4 cm are very likely to progress to adenocarcinoma.  KRAS protooncogene mutation facilitates the growth of adenomas by causing uncontrolled cell proliferation."

Other findings include an increase in number/size of nucleoli, nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, and number of mitotic figures. $ Most cases of #sporadic colorectal carcinoma# arise via the classic adenoma-to-carcinoma sequence (APC/beta-catenin pathway).  The #first mutation# in this pathway usually involves the #APC tumor suppressor gene#, which is responsible for regulating cell growth/adhesion (patients with familial adenomatous polyposis inherit an APC gene mutation and exhibit tumorigenesis at an early age).  Mutations in K-RAS, DCC (Deleted in Colon Cancer), and p53 occur #later# in the adenoma-to-carcinoma sequence #(choices B, C, and E)#.  K-RAS proto-oncogene and DCC gene mutations lead to unregulated cell proliferation and avoidance of apoptosis, respectively.  They are usually observed in larger adenomas (>1 cm) or carcinomas.  The p53 tumor suppressor gene regulates the cell cycle and promotes repair of damaged DNA; mutations are found in most colon carcinomas but rarely adenomas. $ (Choice D)  Mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes such as MLH1 and MSH2 result in microsatellite instability and an accumulation of genetic errors in many of the other genes implicated in colorectal carcinogenesis.  Mutations in MLH1 and MSH2 cause hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (Lynch syndrome) but are not frequently associated with sporadic colorectal carcinoma. $ Educational objective Mutation of the APC tumor suppressor gene is the first step in the classic adenoma-to-carcinoma sequence; it is found in most cases of sporadic colon cancer and in all patients with familial adenomatous polyposis.  The microsatellite instability pathway is characterized by mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes and is implicated in the development of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (Lynch syndrome).",

This presentation is consistent with a #renal infarction#, likely from thromboembolic disease.  Prolonged ischemia (as seen in infarcted tissue) results in irreversible cellular injury and cellular necrosis. $ @Necrosis@ is an uncontrolled process of cell death that results in denaturation of cellular proteins and enzymatic digestion of cellular components.  Unlike apoptosis, necrosis leads to a loss of membrane integrity and leakage of proinflammatory intracellular material that can injure the surrounding tissue. $ Necrosis occurs in several distinct morphologic patterns.  In most organs, irreversible #ischemic injury# typically results in #coagulative necrosis#.  Because the digestive enzymes denature before they can significantly disrupt tissue integrity, the cellular architecture is maintained but nuclei are absent.  A major exception is tissue within the CNS, in which ischemia (eg, stroke) causes liquefactive necrosis with digestion of cellular constituents and liquefaction of necrotic tissue #(choice E)#. $ (Choice A)  Caseous necrosis is a pattern of necrosis seen with mycobacterial or certain fungal (eg, Histoplasma, Cryptococcus) infections.  Collections of epithelioid macrophages and giant cells surround white, friable, cheese-like material made up of cell fragments and proteinaceous debris (ie, caseating granulomas). $ (Choice C)  Fat necrosis occurs in areas with high numbers of adipocytes (eg, pancreas, breast, subcutaneous fat) and is frequently seen in pancreatitis.  Enzymes released from damaged cells break down triglycerides into free fatty acids, which combine with calcium to form soaps; anucleated adipocytes with calcium deposits are visible on microscopy. $ (Choice D)  Fibrinoid necrosis is a histologic pattern of injury seen in the walls of blood vessels affected by vasculitis or malignant hypertension.  It results from immune complexes and/or plasma proteins (eg, fibrin) leaking through the damaged intima and depositing within the vessel wall; the deposits appear histologically as a circumferential ring of pink, amorphous material surrounding the vascular lumen. $ (Choice F)  Dystrophic calcification occurs in areas of tissue injury or necrosis that escape removal by phagocytes.  Phosphate ions in the necrotic tissue bind calcium to form salts, which can appear grossly as white granules and microscopically as amorphous, basophilic material on hematoxylin and eosin stain.  However, the calcification develops slowly over the months and years following the initial injury. $ Educational objective Lethal tissue ischemia causes coagulative necrosis in most tissues (eg, kidney, myocardium); cellular architecture is maintained but nuclei are absent.  The exception is ischemic cell death in the CNS, which causes liquefactive necrosis.",

If there is damaged DNA, p53 will prevent the cell from progressing to mitosis, causing the cell to be arrested in the G1 phase.

Cells with damaged DNA are not allowed to enter the S phase to limit propagation of mutations. $ #Retinoblastoma (Rb) protein# is a regulator of the G1/S phase transition.  The Rb protein has two forms, active (dephosphorylated) or inactive (phosphorylated).  When the cell is stimulated by growth factors, activation of cyclin D, cyclin E, and the corresponding cyclin kinases (CDK 4 and 2) occurs and the Rb protein is #phosphorylated# (rendering it inactive).  Phosphorylated Rb releases the E2F transcription factor, which #allows progression through the G1/S checkpoint#.  After the cell divides, Rb protein is dephosphorylated (active) and remains so until the cell is ready to enter S phase again. $ In terminally differentiated cells, the Rb protein stays in the dephosphorylated (active) state bound to E2F transcription factors, resulting in inhibited transcription of genes necessary for G1/S transition.  Therefore, active Rb protein stops the cell from dividing and allows the cell to enter a quiescent (G0) phase. $ (Choice A)  Caspases are cysteine proteases, enzymes essential for apoptosis.

Normal tissues (composed primarily of differentiated cells) contain high levels of p27, and malignant tissues contain very low levels of p27.  Upregulation of p27 would stop the cell cycle. $ (Choice D)  Protein kinase A is a component of the cAMP signaling system.

The lifetime risk that ≥1 of these polyps will transform to #invasive colon cancer# is nearly 100%.  Therefore, prophylactic colectomy is usually advised. $ FAP is caused by a #germline mutation# in the tumor suppressor gene adenomatous polyposis coli (APC).  Although it is an autosomal dominant disorder, a spontaneous mutation to the other (wild-type) APC gene is required for expression (which usually occurs in the patient's teens or twenties).  APC encodes for a protein that degrades beta-catenin.  #Loss of function of the APC protein# increases cellular concentrations of beta-catenin, which activates transcriptional proteins that lead to intestinal crypt hyperproliferation; accumulation of @subsequent mutations@ leads to development of polyps. $ APC plays a crucial role in generation of both hereditary and spontaneous forms of colon cancer.

Therapeutic #ionizing radiation# is commonly used to treat or palliate many types of cancer (eg, prostate, breast) and causes cell damage through 2 primary mechanisms: $ • DNA double-strand breakage:  Breakage of both strands is required; single-strand breaks can be repaired by polymerases. $ • #Generation of reactive oxygen species#:  Unstable molecules formed by the ionization of water; oxygen free radicals can cause cellular and DNA damage. $ Radiation-induced DNA damage impairs mitosis and initiates #apoptosis# of susceptible cells, including #intestinal crypt stem cells# and other highly proliferative cells (eg, cancer cells, hematogenous precursors).  Cellular damage also induces an immune response characterized by increased expression of #proinflammatory cytokines# (eg, IL-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha) and migration of leukocytes (eg, neutrophils) to the affected tissue, processes that produce additional reactive oxygen species and contribute to the radiation-induced tissue damage. $ In the gastrointestinal tract, these changes result in progressive inflammation, edema, and #mucosal denudation# that decrease the absorptive area.  Abdominal pain and diarrhea typically manifest several weeks after radiotherapy is started.  In some cases, the effects of radiation exposure can be delayed until years after radiation exposure and present as complications of intestinal fibrosis (eg, strictures, adhesions, bowel obstruction). $ (Choice B)  The ubiquitin-proteasome system has an integral role in maintaining normal cell function by degrading damaged proteins and contributing to cell cycle control.  Although proteasome activity normally increases in response to oxidative stress, this system is inhibited by ionizing radiation, potentiating the apoptotic effects of radiotherapy. $ #(Choices C, D, and E)#  Many chemotherapeutic agents impair essential steps in the DNA and cellular repair processes and can potentiate the effects of ionizing radiation.  Although inhibition of DNA polymerase (eg, nucleoside analogues), inhibition of thymidylate synthesis (eg, 5-fluorouracil), and prevention of microtubule assembly (eg, vinblastine) would contribute to the cytotoxic effects of radiation, radiation-induced tissue damage occurs primarily through the generation of free radicals. $ Educational objective Ionizing radiation causes cellular and DNA damage primarily through generation of reactive oxygen species, which can trigger progressive inflammation and tissue damage.  In the gastrointestinal tract, the acute effects of radiation exposure typically occur several weeks after radiotherapy is initiated and manifest as abdominal pain and diarrhea due to mucosal denudation, inflammation, and edema."

However, chronic exposure to acidic stomach contents can damage the epithelial surface and result in the release of cytokines and growth factors that cause esophageal stem cells to #differentiate# into an #alternate epithelial cell type# (@columnar epithelium with goblet cells@) better suited for an acidic environment.  The substitution of one differentiated epithelial cell type for another in response to adverse environmental conditions is called #metaplasia#. $ Metaplasia is also seen in the trachea and #bronchi# of #chronic cigarette smokers#; there, the irritative effect of smoke leads to replacement of normal ciliated columnar cells with heartier stratified squamous epithelium.  Although this @cellular adaptation@ reduces epithelial injury, it also eliminates the cell types that contain cilia and produce mucus, which increases the risk for respiratory infection. $ Metaplasia is a reversible condition, but continued environmental stress can lead to #malignant transformation# (metaplasia → dysplasia → invasive cancer).

Patients with this disorder are genetically predisposed to cancer development at a #young# age.  Patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome inherit one mutated allele of TP53, but somatic mutation of the second allele is needed for tumor development (@2-hit hypothesis@). $ p53 plays an essential role in maintaining the integrity of the human genome by causing cells with mutant DNA to arrest in the @G1/S stage@ of the cell cycle until the damage is repaired.  Normally, cells with irreversible DNA damage are not allowed to divide and proceed to apoptosis.  Without a functioning p53 protein, the defective cells divide unchecked and become cancerous. $ (Choice A)  The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene mutation is found in patients with familial polyposis syndromes, sporadic colon cancer, and melanomas.  APC is responsible for maintaining low levels of β-catenin (oncogenic protein) and for intercellular adhesion. $ (Choice B)  Mutation of the BRCA1 tumor suppressor gene increases the risk for breast and ovarian cancers, and it is the most common hereditary breast cancer.  This mutation is not associated with sarcomas, leukemia, or brain tumors. $ (Choice C)  NF2 is a tumor suppressor gene.  Mutation of NF2 increases the risk for developing neurofibromatosis type 2.

Symptoms include bilateral hearing loss, vertigo, and tinnitus. $ (Choice E)  RB1 is a tumor suppressor gene that codes for the Rb protein, which regulates the G1-S checkpoint of the cell cycle.  Mutation of RB1 predisposes to the development of @retinoblastomas@ and osteosarcomas, but not breast cancer or leukemia.  The 2-hit hypothesis has been proposed to account for hereditary retinoblastoma. $ Educational objective Li-Fraumeni syndrome is caused by an autosomal dominant mutation in the tumor suppressor gene TP53.

Tumor cells down-regulate cadherin (eg, E-cadherin), which decreases cell-cell adhesion and frees individual cells to leave the site of origin #(choice D)#. $ • #Detachment from the basement membrane:#  Basal epithelial cells tightly adhere to the basement membrane using integrins, which anchor the basal end of the cytoskeleton to external collagen, laminin, and fibronectin.  This attachment helps maintain cellular differentiation and limits excessive cellular growth.  Tumor cells loosen their attachment to the basement membrane by altering the expression of integrins. $ • #Degradation of extracellular matrix:#  The basement membrane serves as a mechanical barrier that separates tumor cells from blood vessels and lymphatics in the interstitial matrix.

Tumor suppressor genes are involved in multiple processes, including: $ • #DNA repair# $ •Cellular differentiation $ • Checkpoint control of the cell cycle$• Transcription factor regulation.$ BRCA1 and BRCA2 are involved in repair of #double-stranded DNA breaks#.

Adhesion molecules such as E-cadherin are also responsible for transduction of growth signals important for normal tissue growth and regeneration; disruption of intercellular adhesion signaling can promote unchecked cellular proliferation. $ (Choice E)  A large number of malignancies are associated with aberrant signal transduction.  For example, overexpression of HER2 (a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in growth signal transduction) causes the development of certain types of aggressive breast cancer.  Unlike BRCA1 and BRCA2, HER2 mutations are acquired, not inherited. $ Educational objective Hereditary breast cancer is most commonly associated with mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2.

  "explanation_2": "This patient who has recurrent abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea with CT evidence of bowel wall thickening in the distal colon and rectum likely has ulcerative colitis.  Chronic inflammatory conditions are characterized by the persistent stimulation of neutrophils and macrophages, leading to long-term elevation of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, #IL-6#, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interferon-gamma.  The liver responds to these circulating cytokines (particularly IL-6) by generating #acute phase reactants#, proteins that modulate and influence the inflammatory response and play some role in innate immunity. $ Testing for acute phase reactants can help diagnose and track conditions associated with inflammation, including infections, autoimmune diseases, and malignancies.  The test described in this case is the #erythrocyte sedimentation rate# (ESR), which begins by placing whole blood in a narrow vertical tube.  Erythrocytes settle at the bottom of the tube over time due to gravity as their density is greater than plasma.  ESR is a measure of the length of plasma on top of the erythrocyte sediment layer at 1 hour.  The presence of acute phase reactants, particularly fibrinogen and globulins, causes erythrocytes to overcome their zeta potential (negative charge that separates them) and form a stacked, #rouleaux formation#, which settles to the bottom of the tube more quickly and #increases ESR#. $ (Choice A)  Bradykinin is a component of the kinin system.  It is a short-lived peptide that causes vasodilation, increases vascular permeability, stimulates endothelial smooth muscle dilation, and mediates pain. $ (Choice B)  Erythropoietin is a growth factor for erythrocyte precursors in the bone marrow.  It is produced by peritubular cells of the kidneys in response to hypoxia. $ (Choice D)  Leukotriene B4 is a metabolite of arachidonic acid.  Its main function is to stimulate neutrophil migration to the site of inflammation. $ (Choice E)  Platelet-activating factor is released by endothelium, platelets, and immune cells, and is involved in leukocyte function (eg, endothelium attachment, phagocytosis, degranulation), platelet stimulation, and changes to vascular tone and permeability. $ (Choice F)  Thromboxane A2 is one of the products of the cyclooxygenase pathway.  It is synthesized by platelets and causes platelet activation and aggregation.  It does not cause erythrocyte aggregation or rouleaux formation. $ Educational objective Chronic inflammation is associated with increased circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines (eg, IL-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha), which stimulates the liver to release acute-phase reactants (eg, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen).  The presence of acute-phase reactants increases the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, a nonspecific marker for inflammation."

  "explanation_2": "$Tumor formation is driven by the accumulation of @mutations@ that lead to #uncontrolled cell growth#.  Two @types of genes@ can be altered to increase malignant potential: $ • #Protooncogenes# (eg, RET), which require #gain-of-function# mutations to convert to oncogenes.  They typically encode proteins that #promote cell division# (eg, growth factors, receptors, signal transduction factors).  Only one allele must be damaged to increase the risk of cancer formation. $ • #Tumor suppressor# genes (eg, TP53, RB), in which #loss of function# results in unregulated growth.  They typically encode proteins involved in apoptosis or inhibition of cell cycle progression; both alleles must be inactivated to increase the risk of malignancy. $ Oncoviruses can induce cancer-forming mutations through the expression of proteins that activate protooncogenes or inactivate tumor suppressor genes.  Human papillomavirus (HPV) is implicated in several types of cancer, including head and neck, cervical, anal, and penile cancer.  HPV produces #viral oncoproteins E6 and E7#, both of which affect tumor suppressors: $ • HPV viral protein E6 binds to p53, a tumor suppressor protein that normally inhibits the proliferation of cells with genetic abnormalities.  Ubiquitination of the E6-p53 complex induces #degradation of p53#, leading to unregulated cellular growth. $ • HPV viral protein E7 #binds to# retinoblastoma #(Rb)# protein, which results in the displacement of E2F (a transcription factor that induces cell cycle activation), promoting unregulated DNA replication and cyclin-mediated cell cycling. $ #(Choices A and C)#  BRAF encodes for a serine/threonine–specific protein kinase involved in regulating the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway.  It is often mutated in melanoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and papillary thyroid cancer.  RET encodes for a receptor tyrosine kinase and is associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2A, MEN 2B, and papillary thyroid cancer.  Both RET and BRAF are protooncogenes that require gain-of-function mutations to become oncogenes.  Decreased activity can protect against uncontrolled proliferation (eg, BRAF inhibitors used in melanoma). $ #(Choices D and E)#  BRCA1 and BRCA2 (associated with breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers) encode a DNA repair protein.  MEN1 (associated with MEN1) encodes for the protein menin, which has diverse functions that may be related to regulation of cell cycle kinase inhibitor and homeobox genes.  Both BRCA1/2 and MEN1 are tumor suppressor genes, meaning that their inactivation (rather than overexpression) leads to tumor development. $ Educational objective Inactivation of retinoblastoma protein activity by human papillomavirus can lead to the formation of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.",

  "explanation_2": "$This patient's pale red reflex and well-circumscribed white mass within the retina are indicative of #retinoblastoma#.  Retinoblastoma is an intraocular tumor caused by inactivating mutations affecting the #RB1 tumor suppressor gene# with subsequent dysregulation of the cell cycle. $ The cell cycle consists of the following stages: $ •Gap phase 0 (G0 phase) is a resting stage in which the cell cycle is suspended. $ • Interphase is the stage in which the cell prepares for division.  Interphase is subdivided into the G1 phase (synthesis of RNA, protein, lipid, and carbohydrate), S phase (DNA replication), and the G2 phase (ATP synthesis). $ • Mitosis (M) is the stage in which the cell divides into two daughter cells. $ Checkpoints occur at the G1/S and G2/M transitions, allowing the cell cycle to be stopped if damaged DNA is detected by cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases.  DNA repair mechanisms are activated, but if the DNA damage is too substantial, the cell undergoes apoptosis. $ The #RB1 gene# encodes the Rb protein that regulates the #G1/S checkpoint#.  In its active form, Rb protein binds and inhibits E2F transcription factors, thereby halting the cell cycle.  In contrast, when a cell is ready to divide, Rb protein is phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinases, allowing the cell to proceed through the G1/S checkpoint.  #Loss-of-function# mutations affecting the Rb protein result in unrestricted progression through the G1/S checkpoint, leading to #uncontrolled cell division#.  Inciting RB1 mutations have been linked to retinoblastoma and #osteosarcoma#. $ (Choice A)  Many receptor tyrosine kinases have stimulatory effects on cell growth, and increased receptor activity occurs with a variety of cancers.  For example, overexpression of EGFR and MET are associated with non–small cell lung cancer, and HER2 is associated with breast cancer. $ (Choice B)  Abnormal K-Ras GTPase function due to a @KRAS mutation@ prevents the conversion of GTP to GDP, which results in constant activation of the MAPK pathway and uncontrolled cellular proliferation.  KRAS mutations are associated with lung and colorectal cancers, not retinoblastoma. $ (Choice C)  Tumor suppressor protein p53 arrests the cell cycle at the G1/S checkpoint if DNA damage is detected and initiates cell apoptosis if DNA repair fails.  Mutations of p53 are associated with most cancers, particularly Li-Fraumeni syndrome (sarcoma, breast, leukemia, and adrenal cancers).  Rb and p53 proteins are both critical components of tumor suppression pathways, and their normal function complements one another to prevent cancer progression. $ (Choice E)  BRCA1 and BRCA2 are two of many DNA repair genes that have been identified.  When mutated, these genes are associated with an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer. $ Educational objective Retinoblastoma is associated with inactivating mutations of the RB1 tumor suppressor gene, which normally restricts cells from passing the G1/S checkpoint until the cell is ready to divide.  Impaired function of the Rb protein allows unrestricted progression through the G1/S checkpoint, leading to uncontrolled cell division.",

Patients typically have dyspnea, nonproductive cough, finger clubbing, and inspiratory crackles.  The onset is insidious, prognosis is poor, and no curative treatment exists. $(Choice A)  Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency causes alveolar wall destruction, resulting in panacinar emphysema.  Patients tend to present at a young age with dyspnea, productive cough, and wheezing.  Emphysematous changes (eg, bullae) are seen predominantly at the lung bases, and histologic findings include large alveoli with thin septa. $ (Choice B)  Asbestosis usually occurs in patients with occupational exposures (eg, shipbuilding).  Microscopy may show fibrosis and honeycombing, but asbestosis can be differentiated from IPF by the presence of asbestos bodies (brown, beaded rods coated with iron-containing material) and ferruginous bodies (inorganic particles with a similar ferrous material).  Pleural plaques are also common. $ (Choice C)  Chronic bronchitis causes significant sputum production over a prolonged period and is often related to smoking.  Histologic findings include mild lymphocytic infiltrates and mucous gland hyperplasia with mucus-filled bronchioles. $ (Choice D)  Chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis is due to repeated exposure to an inciting agent (eg, birds, fungi, chemicals).  Cough and dyspnea occur shortly after exposure to the antigen and may progress to respiratory failure.  Histologic findings include noncaseating granulomas, peribronchiolar fibrosis, and patchy lymphocytic infiltrates. $ (Choice E)  Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia is another interstitial lung disease of unclear etiology that typically presents with dry cough, dyspnea, and fatigue.  However, histologic findings include fibroblastic plugs in the alveolar sacs and ducts, often extending into adjacent alveoli in a characteristic butterfly pattern. $ Educational objective Histologic findings of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis are most prominent in the lung periphery and include a heterogeneous mixture of chronic inflammation and patchy interstitial fibrosis, focal fibroblast proliferation, and formation of fibrotic cystic spaces in a honeycomb pattern.",

HP is an exaggerated immunologic response to an inhaled antigen; common offending agents include mold, bacteria, animal protein, and chemicals.  The condition has variable presentation that is largely dependent on the dose and chronicity of antigen exposure: $ • #Acute HP# involves abrupt-onset and often recurring episodes of fever, chills, cough, dyspnea, and fatigue that coincide with intermittent high-dose antigen exposure.  Leukocytosis is often present.  Chest x-ray may be normal or show scattered micronodular opacification. $ • #Chronic HP# involves persistent and #gradually progressive symptoms# (as in this patient) resulting from long-term, moderate-dose antigen exposure.  Patients usually have symptoms of cough, dyspnea, fatigue, and weight loss for several months or more.  Lung auscultation usually reveals #fine crackles#, and chest x-ray shows #interstitial reticular opacities# consistent with the development of pulmonary fibrosis. $ The diagnosis of HP can be aided by pulmonary function testing that reveals a #restrictive pattern#; the restriction is worse with chronic HP and is accompanied by more severe impairments in gas exchange (eg, hypoxemia, low DLCO).

Lymphocytic infiltrate may be present on biopsy, but granulomas are not typical. $ (Choice D)  Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis can present quite similarly to chronic HP, but affected patients are usually older (eg, age >50) and granulomas are not expected on lung biopsy. $ (Choice E)  Pulmonary tuberculosis typically presents with fever, cough, dyspnea, night sweats, and weight loss.

The presence of these organisms in this patient's lung lesion is highly suggestive of a developing @lung abscess@.  As an abscess evolves, it typically forms a cavitary lesion with an identifiable @air-fluid level@ on imaging.  Symptoms are often indolent and include fever, night sweats, weight loss, and a cough producing #foul-smelling sputum# (indicating anaerobes). $ Lung abscesses are usually caused by one of the following: $ • #Aspiration# of oral bacteria into the lower airways (most common) – These abscesses are usually composed of a combination of #anaerobic oral flora# (eg, Peptostreptococcus, Prevotella, Bacteroides, Fusobacterium) and aerobic organisms (eg, Streptococcus).  Risk is greatest in those who have conditions associated with #loss of consciousness# or #impaired swallowing#, such as alcoholism, drug abuse, #neurologic disease# (eg, seizures, stroke), or anatomic abnormalities (eg, esophageal strictures or diverticula). $ • Bacterial pneumonia – Lung abscess can occur in the setting of certain bacterial pneumonias such as those due to Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  Most cases arise in the hospital setting and occur in patients with immunosuppression, older age, or underlying lung disease. $ • Bacteremia and/or infectious endocarditis – Hematogenous spread of an infection to the lung usually causes multiple, monomicrobial lung abscesses.  The most common causative agents are Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species. $ (Choice A)  Mitral valve prolapse is a risk factor for development of subacute bacterial endocarditis (with Streptococcus species).  Left-sided endocarditis could cause septic embolization to downstream organs (eg, spleen, brain) but would not send septic emboli to the lungs. $ (Choice B)  Bronchogenic carcinoma can cause bronchial obstruction and postobstructive pneumonia, which may lead to secondary abscess formation.  However, these lung abscesses would be less likely to contain oral anaerobic flora. $ (Choice C)  Lung abscess may be associated with a prior penetrating trauma.  Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species (introduced from the skin) are usually responsible. $ (Choice E)  Tobacco smoking compromises pulmonary defenses and predisposes patients to developing community-acquired pneumonia due to common pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae.  These organisms are less likely to cause lung abscess. $ (Choice F)  Urinary infections can be associated with bacteremia, particularly in those with diabetes mellitus, advanced age, or structural urinary abnormalities.  However, most urinary infections are caused by coliform bacteria (eg, E coli) from the lower gastrointestinal tract.  Lung abscess is not a common complication of urinary infection, and Peptostreptococcus and Fusobacterium would be unusual urinary organisms. $ Educational objective Lung abscess is most often due to aspiration of anaerobic oral bacteria such as Peptostreptococcus, Prevotella, Bacteroides, and Fusobacterium species.  Risk factors for lung abscess include conditions that increase aspiration risk, such as alcoholism, drug abuse, seizure disorders, previous stroke, and dementia.",

  "explanation_2": "The patient is a former smoker and presents with #digital clubbing#, a thickening and widening of the nail bed and distal phalanges that give the fingers a bulbous @drumstick appearance@.  Normally, when two opposing fingers are held nail to nail, a diamond-shaped space is formed between proximal nail folds; obliteration of this space is consistent with clubbing. $ Clubbing is observed in cardiopulmonary disease states where #hypoxic-inflammatory pathways# are activated, releasing platelet and fibroblast-derived #growth factors# (especially vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]) that promote platelet clumping/embedment in the distal capillary beds (fingers, toes), which then leads to #local fibrovascular proliferation#. $ #Lung adenocarcinoma# (ie, tumor-secreted VEGF) is the most common cause of clubbing in adults.  Other common causes of clubbing include chronic chest infections (eg, bronchiectasis) and cardiopulmonary diseases with hypoxemia (eg, cyanotic heart defects).  Occasionally, clubbing is associated with a painful periosteal reaction and synovitis, known as #hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy#, a paraneoplastic syndrome strongly linked to lung adenocarcinoma. $ Examination for clubbing is clinically valuable because it may be the #only visible physical sign# of lung cancer, including small and surgically resectable (curable) tumors that would be otherwise asymptomatic.  Therefore, the presence of clubbing should prompt further imaging of the chest for malignancy. $ (Choice A)  Uncomplicated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD without hypoxemia) alone is not associated with clubbing; clubbing in a patient with COPD should trigger further investigation for underlying complications (eg, malignancy, bronchiectasis, pulmonary hypertension).  In addition, this patient has normal breath sounds, making COPD (eg, emphysema, chronic bronchitis) unlikely. $ (Choice B)  Chronic renal failure is associated with @\"half-and-half\" nails@ (Lindsay nails), a sharply demarcated transverse leukonychia.  The mechanism remains unknown but is unlikely to be related to azotemia because the transition line disappears after renal transplantation but not with hemodialysis. $ (Choice C)  Iron deficiency anemia is associated with @koilonychia@, or scooped concavity of the nail bed (\"spoon nails\"), possibly due to chronic nutrient deficiency leading to regression of the nail matrix. $ (Choice E)  @Psoriatic nail dystrophy@ is due to primary involvement of the nail by psoriasis itself.  It manifests as nail pitting, thickening, brittleness, and onycholysis (separation from the underlying nail bed). $ Educational objective The most common cause of digital clubbing in adults is pulmonary malignancy (especially lung adenocarcinoma).  More generally, clubbing is a sign of chronic cardiopulmonary disease associated with activation of hypoxic-inflammatory signaling (eg, chronic chest infections, right-to-left shunting).",

  "explanation_2": "This patient has calcified lung, mediastinal, and splenic lesions that are stable over time and asymptomatic, raising suspicion for a contained #granulomatous infection#.  The most likely cause is the dimorphic fungus #Histoplasma capsulatum#, which exists as a mold in the soil of the #Ohio# and Mississippi River Valleys (midwestern/central United States). $ The pathogen is inhaled into the lungs, where it converts to yeast form and is phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages.  Macrophages cannot initially eliminate the organism due to microbial virulence factors that prevent phagolysosome formation and acidification.  Therefore, H capsulatum is able to replicate within the macrophage and spread through the draining #lymphatic system# and (often) into the reticuloendothelial system (eg, #spleen#, liver). $ After about 2 weeks, patients with intact immunity develop a cell-mediated immune response that contains the infection within granulomas.  Over time, the granulomas fibrose and #calcify# and can be visualized on radiographic imaging at the initial sites of infection (eg, lungs, hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes, spleen).  In healthy patients, most infections with H capsulatum are asymptomatic and are therefore often discovered incidentally during evaluation for an unrelated condition (eg, nephrolithiasis). $ (Choice B)  Metastatic cancer often causes @multiple lung lesions@.  However, these lesions generally enlarge in size over time and calcification is rare. $ (Choice C)  @Miliary tuberculosis@ is marked by multiple pulmonary lesions and clinical illness (eg, fever, night sweats); calcified lesions would be atypical.  Although primary tuberculosis is often associated with a calcified lung and an ipsilateral hilar lymph node lesion (Ranke complex), tuberculosis is unlikely in this case given the patient's negative tuberculin skin test. $ (Choice D)  Parathyroid adenoma is a benign tumor that does not spread to the lungs; it is often associated with hypercalcemia due to increased secretion of parathyroid hormone.  Although metastatic calcification can be a rare manifestion of hyperparathyroidism (it is more common with end-stage renal disease), such patients would almost certainly have systemic signs of hypercalcemia (eg, weakness, fatigue, depressed mood). $ (Choice E)  Silica inhalation can cause innumerable, small, rounded opacities in the upper lobes of the lungs that may fibrose over time, resulting in pulmonary disease.  Silica exposure is primarily occupational (eg, miners, sandblasters). $ Educational objective Histoplasma capsulatum replicates within macrophages and often spreads from the lungs through the pulmonary lymphatics to the reticuloendothelial system (eg, spleen, liver).  Most healthy individuals quickly contain the infection within granulomas and do not become ill; a minority develop self-limited pneumonia.  Over time, the granulomas at the initial sites of infection calcify and may be seen incidentally on radiographic imaging.",

Pathophysiologically, the traumatic event #dislodges fat globules# from the bone marrow and allows them to enter disrupted marrow venules, where they can then traverse the systemic veins and deposit in pulmonary microvessels.  The #pulmonary capillary occlusion# impairs gas exchange and induces #hypoxemia#; release of free fatty acids from the fat globules also causes local toxic injury to the endothelium, potentially leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome. $ Some fat globules escape the lungs via precapillary arteriovenous shunts that open due to increased pulmonary artery pressure.

Mononuclear interstitial pulmonary infiltrates are found early in the course of a variety of interstitial lung diseases.  A red thrombus lodged in the pulmonary artery is consistent with a thromboembolism from a deep venous source.

The clinical presentation is typically acute with high-grade fever, and tachycardia and hypotension due to septic shock.  The majority of patients with tricuspid valve endocarditis experience embolization of tricuspid valve vegetation fragments; these fragments lodge in distal portions of the pulmonary arterial tree and cause septic pulmonary infarcts.  The infarcts are typically #wedge-shaped# due to the triangular perfusion field of small arteries at the lung periphery.  Due to the relatively low density of lung tissue (which allows blood seepage into tissue during infarction) and a dual blood supply (ie, pulmonary and bronchial arteries), pulmonary infarcts are typically #hemorrhagic (red)# rather than ischemic (white). $ (Choice A)  Miliary tuberculosis typically has a subacute or chronic presentation and is accompanied by night sweats, weight loss, and anorexia.  Innumerable, small, white nodules resembling millet seeds are typically seen; peripherally located wedge-shaped hemorrhages in the lung are not characteristic. $ (Choice B)  Mycotic aneurysms may occur as a complication of endocarditis; however, they refer to the local destruction and dilation of an arterial wall due to infection.  Despite their name, mycotic aneurysms are very rarely associated with fungal infections. $ (Choice C)  Small airway obstruction is characteristic of asthma, which typically presents with dyspnea, cough, wheezing, and chest tightness.  Lung autopsy usually reveals the occlusion of bronchi and bronchioles by thick mucous plugs containing shed epithelium. $ (Choice E)  Venous thromboembolism in the pulmonary vasculature (ie, thrombotic pulmonary embolism) can also cause wedge-shaped hemorrhagic infarct in the periphery of the lung.  However, this patient's high-grade fever and recent intravenous drug use are more suggestive of septic emboli from tricuspid valve endocarditis.  In addition, multiple pulmonary infarcts are more consistent with septic embolization than venous thromboembolism. $ Educational objective Pulmonary infarcts are typically hemorrhagic (red) and wedge-shaped in the periphery of the lung.

One of the most serious effects of SHS exposure is the increased risk for #sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)#. $ SIDS refers to the unexpected death of a previously healthy infant with an inconclusive postmortem examination.  Almost all cases are associated with at least 1 risk factor, such as prematurity, an unsafe sleep environment, and smoke exposure.  Smoke exposure likely contributes to SIDS by causing #impaired arousal# and cardiovascular response to stimuli (eg, hypoxemia). $ The risk of SIDS is further increased in cases of #maternal cigarette use during pregnancy#, which is associated with impaired fetal oxygenation and direct exposure of the fetus to toxins (eg, nicotine, carbon monoxide).  The degree of risk correlates with the amount of cigarette use, suggesting a dose-response relationship between smoking and SIDS. $ (Choice A)  Because maternal smoking during pregnancy (not seen here) increases the risk of preterm delivery, the risk of prematurity-associated complications (eg, apnea of prematurity) is also increased.  However, these risks do not increase with postnatal SHS exposure.  Moreover, apnea of prematurity typically presents with apneic episodes in the first 2-3 days of life. $ (Choice B)  SHS increases the risk for respiratory tract disease and recurrent otitis media in children; parents who smoke outside the home should be counseled on cessation because chemicals from cigarette smoke are adsorbed and retained by clothing, skin, and hair and therefore still pose a risk to children.  SHS is not associated with an increased risk for epilepsy. $ (Choice C)  SHS does not increase the risk for failure to thrive in infancy.  In fact, SHS may be associated with childhood obesity. $ (Choice E)  SHS exposure in childhood increases the risk for atrial fibrillation in adulthood but is not associated with ventricular arrhythmias. $ Educational objective Maternal tobacco use during pregnancy and secondhand smoke exposure are associated with an increased risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).

Meconium ileus is a very specific finding for #cystic fibrosis# (CF).  Although only 10%-20% of infants with CF will have meconium ileus at birth, almost all full-term infants with meconium ileus are eventually diagnosed with CF.  Abnormalities in chloride, sodium, and water transport by the ductal epithelium of intestinal mucous glands cause isotonic dehydration of the lumen contents.  This results in secretion of #abnormally viscous mucus# into the small bowel.  In the United States, pneumonia, bronchiectasis, and cor pulmonale account for most deaths due to CF. $ (Choice A)  Patients with Hirschsprung disease (HD) typically present with signs of intestinal obstruction in the newborn period that are similar to meconium ileus.  However, HD typically presents with increased rectal tone, \"squirt sign\" (forceful expulsion of stool after rectal examination), and obstruction at the rectosigmoid region with a transition zone between the aganglionic rectum and proximal dilated colon.  Enterocolitis (diarrhea, abdominal pain/distension, and fever) is the most common cause of mortality in patients with HD. $ (Choice B)  Focal biliary or multilobular cirrhosis due to plugging of bile canaliculi by dehydrated mucinous material develops in approximately 5% of CF patients.  Death from cirrhotic liver failure is much less likely than terminal pneumonia. $ (Choice C)  Most patients with CF have exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, which causes malabsorption and steatorrhea.  Infants often have large foul-smelling stools, abdominal distention, and poor weight gain.  Consequences include deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins, hypoproteinemia with generalized edema, and persistent diarrhea with rectal prolapse.  However, pancreatic involvement is rarely fatal with pancreatic enzyme supplementation. $ (Choice E)  Although the CFTR protein is expressed in nephrons, patients with CF usually do not manifest serious renal dysfunction or failure.  Patients with CF, however, are at elevated risk for nephrolithiasis and renal damage from nephrotoxic medications (eg, aminoglycosides). $ Educational objective Meconium ileus is a distal small bowel obstruction due to abnormally dehydrated meconium in a patient with cystic fibrosis (CF).

Interspersed goblet cells produce mucus that traps inhaled debris.  The ciliated and goblet cells of respiratory epithelium are together responsible for mucociliary clearance. $ In response to #chronic irritation#, such as #smoking#, the respiratory epithelium may be replaced with squamous epithelium.  This change of cell types is called #squamous metaplasia# and is seen histologically as a transition to stratified polygonal epithelial cells.  This transition is initially @adaptive@ because squamous cells are more resistant to irritation than columnar cells.  However, the lack of cilia and goblet cells prevents effective mucociliary clearance and increases the risk of respiratory infections.  Squamous bronchial metaplasia is reversible and may resolve on discontinuation of smoking, but persistent irritant exposure can cause progression to dysplasia or squamous cell carcinoma. $ Other examples of metaplasia include @Barrett esophagus@, in which esophageal squamous epithelium is replaced by intestinal columnar epithelium with goblet cells in response to chronic acid exposure, and squamous metaplasia of the cervix. $ (Choice B)  Cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) is almost always caused by oncogenic strains of human papillomavirus (HPV) that integrate into the host cell genome.  Although HPV infects the metaplastic epithelium at the cervical transformation zone, development of CSCC is primarily driven by the expression of viral genes that inactivate host tumor-suppressor proteins. $ (Choice C)  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is an autosomal dominant disease caused by defects in the contractile proteins of the cardiac sarcomere.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an acid-fast bacillus that replicates within the alveoli.  The bacteria are phagocytized by alveolar macrophages, which are initially unable to destroy the pathogen due to microbial adaptations that inhibit the formation of an effective phagolysosome.  However, in the weeks after the initial infection, antigen presenting cells (eg, macrophages, dendritic cells) display mycobacterial antigens to naïve CD4+ T lymphocytes in regional lymph nodes, which subsequently differentiate into #T helper type 1# (Th1) cells that #secrete interferon-gamma#. $ Interferon-gamma #activates macrophages#, leading to the formation of fully acidified phagolysosomes capable of destroying intracellular mycobacteria.  Activated macrophages also aggregate and differentiate into epithelioid histiocytes and @multinucleated giant cells@, which surround extracellular mycobacteria within granulomas.  The release of #proteases, nitric oxide, and reactive oxygen species# by these cells helps contain the infection.  However, these compounds also cause extensive #collateral tissue damage# and can result in the formation of cavitary lung lesions. $ (Choice B)  M tuberculosis produces trehalose dimycolate (cord factor), which inhibits phagolysosome maturation and may contribute to the formation of caseating granulomas.  However, cord factor does not directly cause the tissue necrosis associated with cavitary lesions; the release of digestive enzymes by activated macrophages lining the granuloma drives caseation and cavitation. $ (Choice C)  @Lobar pneumonia@ is characterized by the initial accumulation of an abundant proteinaceous exudate within the alveoli, followed by hepatization of the affected lobe.  Lobar pneumonia is typically caused by pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae.  However, lobar pneumonia presents acutely, not slowly, over several weeks. $ (Choice D)  Intraalveolar mycobacteria do not directly cause cavitary lesions.  Activated macrophages that surround the extracellular mycobacteria are primarily responsible for the tissue damage that leads to cavitation. $ (Choice E)  Obliterative lower airway inflammation can occur as a feature of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia.  In this condition, inflammation causes the proliferation of granulation tissue, which obstructs small bronchioles and leads to alveolar consolidation.  However, apical cavitary lesions and hemoptysis are uncommon. $ Educational objective Control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection is mediated primarily by activated macrophages, which surround extracellular mycobacteria and wall them off within granulomas.  The release of digestive enzymes by these cells not only helps control the infection, but also leads to damage of the surrounding tissue and the formation of cavitary lung lesions.",

Increased capillary permeability also leads to the accumulation of erythrocytes and #abundant proteinaceous fluid# in the alveolar space, resulting in the affected lobe becoming heavy and red. $ 2. #Red hepatization# (day 2-4) – The proteinaceous fluid transforms into fibrin strands, resulting in a confluent exudate of fibrin, neutrophils, and erythrocytes.  On gross examination, the lobe appears #liver-like#: Red, firm, and airless. $ 3. #Gray hepatization# (day 4-7) – Red cell disintegration along with increased leukocyte infiltration causes the lung to appear gray rather than red.  Neutrophils begin to be replaced by #macrophages# that begin the repair process. $ 4. #Resolution# (>7 days) – Macrophages secrete digestive enzymes that liquefy the fibrinous exudate, which is reabsorbed, expectorated, or phagocytized by macrophages.  The lung parenchyma regains its normal appearance by approximately 3 weeks. $ Besides lobar pneumonia, there are 2 other major morphologic categories of pneumonia.  #Bronchopneumonia# is an infection of the terminal bronchioles that results in patchy consolidation of a number of lobules.  @Interstitial pneumonia@ is an infection of the interstitial tissue of the lung with minimal or no alveolar infiltrate; atypical pneumonias (eg, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae) are often associated with an interstitial infiltrate. $ (Choice A)  Cardiogenic pulmonary edema is characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the alveoli due to elevations in hydrostatic pressure within the pulmonary capillaries.  Examination often reveals bibasilar crackles and chest x-ray typically shows perihilar alveolar edema with @cephalization@ of the pulmonary vessels. $ (Choice B)  Asthma is characterized by smooth muscle inflammation of the airways leading to intermittent bronchoconstriction and airflow obstruction.  Although cough and shortness of breath can occur during asthma exacerbations, fever and a lobar infiltrate are not typical. $ (Choice C)  Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is associated with pulmonary fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition leading to progressive destruction of the pulmonary architecture.  Patients typically present with slowly worsening dyspnea, nonproductive cough, and bilateral \"Velcro\"-sounding crackles.  Fever is uncommon and chest x-ray usually reveals increased @reticular (interstitial) markings@. $ (Choice E)  Chronic bronchitis is associated with goblet cell metaplasia and inflammation in the large airways.

Lobar infiltrate is uncommon as the alveoli are not primarily affected. $ Educational objective Lobar pneumonia is marked by the cytokine-mediated accumulation of neutrophils and proteinaceous material in the alveoli.

Over time, alveolar fibrosis develops and there is accumulation of @hemosiderin-laden macrophages@, also known as heart failure cells. $ (Choice D)  Severe systemic infection, or sepsis, can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome, in which parenchymal inflammation leads to accumulation of interstitial fluid and fluid leakage in the alveoli.  Histopathology often shows @diffuse alveolar damage@. $ (Choice E)  Thrombosis in the deep veins can lead to acute @pulmonary embolism@.  Due to localized ischemia, the adjacent lung parenchyma can demonstrate coagulative necrosis and hemorrhage. $ Educational objective Fat embolism syndrome most commonly results from the release of fat globules from bone marrow following a long-bone or pelvic fracture.  The fat globules form inflammatory aggregates that cause microvessel obstruction and systemic inflammation leading to the triad of respiratory distress, neurologic dysfunction, and petechial rash.",

  "explanation_2": "This patient with several months of nonproductive cough and exertional dyspnea as well as a #lymphocyte-predominant bronchoalveolar lavage# (BAL) most likely has #hypersensitivity pneumonitis# (HP).  HP results from an exaggerated immunologic response that some individuals develop to an #inhaled antigen# (eg, mold, animal protein).  Those most commonly affected include farmers (ie, #farmer's lung# due to exposure to moldy hay) and bird keepers (ie, #bird fancier's lung# due to exposure to avian proteins). $ The presentation of HP can be acute or chronic.  Acute disease usually involves recurrent episodes of abrupt-onset cough, dyspnea, fever, chills, and fatigue that correlate with intermittent antigen exposure.  Chronic disease likely results from chronic, long-term antigen exposure, and presents with gradually progressive cough, dyspnea, fatigue, and weight loss over a period of several months.  Lung crackles are present with both acute and chronic disease.  Chest x-ray in acute disease is frequently normal, whereas #diffuse reticular interstitial opacities# are present with #chronic disease# as a network of interstitial inflammation and #fibrosis# develops. $ Normally, the leukocytes in alveolar fluid consist of approximately 85% alveolar macrophages, 10% lymphocytes, and a small percentage of neutrophils and eosinophils.  With both acute and chronic HP, #BAL usually shows high relative lymphocyte count# (eg, >20%, often >50%), which helps support the diagnosis.  Other causes of high relative lymphocyte count in BAL include sarcoidosis, lymphoma, and chronic fungal or mycobacterial infection. $ (Choice A)  Asbestosis can present with progressive dyspnea and cough, but BAL typically shows increased neutrophils and characteristic asbestos bodies. $ (Choice B)  Asthma is expected to cause wheezing rather than crackles on lung auscultation.  BAL may show increased eosinophils as well as bronchial epithelial cells. $ (Choice C)  Patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease can have chronic microaspiration, leading to respiratory symptoms (eg, cough, dyspnea).  However, BAL typically shows increased neutrophils and characteristic lipid-laden macrophages that result from the aspiration of lipid-containing food or drink. $ (Choice E)  BAL in cardiogenic pulmonary edema often demonstrates hemosiderin-laden macrophages, resulting from elevated pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure leading to extravasation of red blood cells into the alveoli.  Leukocyte percentages are not significantly affected. $ Educational objective Hypersensitivity pneumonitis results from an exaggerated immunologic response to an inhaled antigen (eg, mold, animal protein), and presents with cough and dyspnea of variable acuity.

A common underlying cause of massive hemoptysis is #bronchiectasis#, as indicated by this patient's autopsy showing #thick, widened airways# and mucus plugging.  Bronchiectasis is often associated with cystic fibrosis and immunodeficiency disorders, which causes chronic and recurrent #airway inflammation# and infection.  This stimulates neovascularization and #bronchial artery hypertrophy#.  The dilated, fragile, and tortuous vessels are in close proximity to the bronchioles and #prone to rupture# with increased airway pressure, such as during #coughing# (eg, acute pulmonary exacerbation). $ Normally, @blood supply to the lungs@ consists of the pulmonary circulation and the #bronchial circulation#.  Pulmonary arteries deliver deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle to the lung parenchyma (ie, respiratory bronchioles to alveoli) to be oxygenated and returned to the heart; bronchial arteries arise from the aorta and supply the endobronchial tree (ie, bronchi to terminal bronchioles) with oxygenated blood.

In addition, bronchiectasis is not associated with either condition. $ (Choice D)  A fistula between the tracheobronchial tree and aorta is usually fatal and can occur with chronic vascular or airway inflammation, typically due to an implanted medical device or stent.  A fistula is an uncommon cause of hemoptysis that would not cause dilated bronchial walls on pathology. $ (Choice E)  Carcinoid tumors are highly vascular endobronchial tumors that commonly present with hemoptysis.  However, autopsy would show a discrete mass (not bronchiectasis). $ Educational objective Massive, life-threatening hemoptysis is typically due to hemorrhage from the high-pressure bronchial circulation.

Her rapid-onset respiratory failure is suggestive of #acute respiratory distress syndrome# (ARDS).  ARDS is characterized by @bilateral pulmonary infiltrates@ and hypoxemia in the absence of heart failure.  It can occur due to direct pulmonary trauma (eg, pulmonary contusions, inhaled irritants) or indirect nonpulmonary insults (eg, sepsis, burns, pancreatitis) that result in pulmonary epithelial and/or endothelial injury. $ The 3 phases of ARDS follow the disease's progression:$ • #Exudative phase:#  Inflammatory cytokines (eg, tumor necrosis factor, IL-1, IL-6) activate the pulmonary endothelium and recruit neutrophils to the lung tissue.  Resultant endothelial damage leads to increased capillary permeability and #leakage of protein-rich fluid into the alveolar space#.  Organization of the edema and cellular debris leads to the formation of @hyaline membranes@. $ • #Proliferative phase:#  One to two weeks later, endothelial cells, pneumocytes, and fibroblasts proliferate in attempts to repair the damaged lung; collagen is deposited and scarring may occur.  Edema is reabsorbed. $ • #Fibrotic phase:#  In a minority of patients, excessive collagen deposition leads to irreversible pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension. $ (Choice B)  Necrotizing inflammation and pulmonary hemorrhage are commonly associated with granulomatosis with polyangiitis, which involves both the lungs and the kidneys.  However, this condition normally presents subacutely with cough, hemoptysis, and nephritic syndrome; this patient's acute respiratory decline in the setting of sepsis is more consistent with ARDS. $ (Choice C)  Noncaseating granulomas are found in sarcoidosis, which typically presents more chronically with cough, skin findings, or uveitis.  Hemodynamic instability and acute respiratory failure would be unexpected. $ (Choice D)  Mucus plugging typically occurs in patients with underlying lung disease (eg, cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).  Mucus plugs can cause hypoxemia but would not be expected to cause hypotension and fevers, and acute respiratory deterioration in the setting of sepsis is more likely due to ARDS. $ (Choice E)  Wedge-shaped areas of hemorrhagic necrosis can be seen with pulmonary embolism, which can cause acute respiratory failure, hypotension, and tachycardia.  However, patients often have chest pain, and in general, decompensation occurs suddenly (not progressively over a course of hours).  In addition, urinary symptoms, confusion, and high fevers are unexpected in this condition. $ Educational objective Acute respiratory distress syndrome is caused by injury of the pulmonary epithelium and/or endothelium, and occurs most often due to sepsis or pneumonia.  Cytokines recruit neutrophils to the lung tissue, which cause capillary damage and leakage of protein-rich fluid into the alveoli.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient with respiratory failure was found to have decreased #lamellar bodies#, which are organelles with concentric sheets of lipid membrane, within @type II pneumocytes@ (cuboidal alveolar cells). $ Normally, type II pneumocytes use lamellar bodies to #store surfactant#, a substance composed of proteins and phospholipids that #decreases alveolar surface tension# and facilitates lung expansion during respiration.  This lipoprotein complex is released from the lamellar bodies by exocytosis into the alveolar spaces, where the lamellar contents unravel into a structured array called tubular myelin.  This lattice network adsorbs to the air-liquid interface of the alveoli and spreads along the alveolar lining, forming a surfactant film.  As the film degrades, surfactant is recycled back into type II pneumocytes by endocytosis for reprocessing. $ Surfactant and the number of lamellar bodies in the fetus rise during the late second and the third trimesters.  Therefore, a #low lamellar body count# reflects surfactant deficiency and lung immaturity, which typically occurs in premature infants with #neonatal respiratory distress syndrome#.  In this condition, alveolar surface tension increases and #alveoli collapse#.  Diffuse atelectasis can lead to respiratory failure within minutes to hours after birth and, in severe cases, death. $ (Choice A)  Emphysema is caused by alveolar wall destruction due to excessive activity of intra-alveolar proteases released by neutrophils and alveolar macrophages.  Decreased lamellar bodies within type II pneumocytes would not be seen. $ (Choice B)  Asthma is characterized by bronchial smooth muscle hyperresponsiveness, and histology typically shows inflammatory cell (eg, eosinophil) infiltration and bronchial smooth muscle hypertrophy.  A deficiency of lamellar bodies and surfactant does not cause bronchoconstriction. $ (Choice C)  Chronic bronchitis manifests as excessive mucus production in the airways and increased inflammatory cells in the submucosa; lamellar body counts would not be affected. $ (Choice E)  A pulmonary embolism appears on histology as organized layers of red cells, platelets, and fibrin within pulmonary arterial vasculature that is surrounded by ischemic lung changes.  Decreased lamellar bodies within type 2 pneumocytes would not be seen. $ Educational objective Lamellar bodies of type II pneumocytes store and release surfactant, which decreases alveolar surface tension and facilitates lung expansion.  A low lamellar body count reflects surfactant deficiency and lung immaturity, as in neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, which results in alveolar collapse and diffuse atelectasis.",

Risk factors include environmental exposures (eg, radon, second-hand smoke) and underlying lung disease. In addition, certain molecular alterations are seen more commonly in nonsmokers; these 'driver mutations' are thought to be responsible for the development of the malignancy and include epidermal growth factor receptor (#EGFR#) mutations and #ALK gene rearrangements#. KRAS mutations, another driver in the formation of adenocarcinoma, are seen more commonly in smokers. $Adenocarcinoma typically presents with cough, weight loss, and hemoptysis. Changes to the distal extremities, including #clubbing# (@increased curvature@ of the nail plate) and hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (proliferation of the bones, skin, and nails of the fingers), may occur and are thought to be due to tumor-derived growth factors. The tumor tends to be #located peripherally# (as in this patient) and may present as a nodule, mass, or obstructive pneumonia. Like all malignancies, metastatic disease to the pleura can cause pleural effusions. $#(Choice B)# Bronchial carcinoid is a rare malignancy that tends to be located centrally, within or adjacent to large bronchi. It typically presents with wheezing due to bronchial obstruction and occasionally also causes carcinoid syndrome (ie, episodic diarrhea, flushing, bronchospasm). $#(Choice C)# Mesothelioma most commonly arises from the mesothelium lining the pleural cavity; tumors are pleural based (ie, pleural mass with associated pleural effusion, pleural thickening), rather than intraparenchymal. In addition, it is extremely rare in nonsmokers with no history of asbestos exposure. $#(Choice D)# Small cell carcinoma is strongly associated with smoking; only 1% of cases occur in nonsmokers. It arises from the basal cells of the bronchial epithelium and displays some neuroendocrine features. Small cell carcinoma usually occurs in major bronchi. $#(Choice E)# Squamous cell carcinoma is also strongly associated with smoking. It usually affects larger bronchi (centrally located) and arises from areas of squamous bronchial metaplasia. $#Educational objective# Adenocarcinoma is the most common primary lung cancer in the general population, women, and nonsmokers. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations and ALK gene rearrangements are seen more commonly in nonsmokers and thought to contribute to disease formation in this subgroup. Adenocarcinoma is typically located peripherally and may be associated with clubbing or hypertrophic osteoarthropathy.",

PSP is nontraumatic and is found in patients without preexisting pulmonary disease (eg, cystic fibrosis). It occurs when a large change in the alveolar or intrapleural pressure results in a break in the visceral pleura and subsequent trapping of air between the parietal and visceral spaces. The superficial alveoli in the apices experience greater pressure changes (due to the weight of the lungs pulling down on the apical tissue), predisposing them to the formation of #subpleural blebs#. The blebs then can spontaneously rupture through the visceral pleura, frequently while the patient is at rest. $Tall, thin males around the age of 20 are most commonly affected. Although the most important risk factor is #smoking#, taller individuals also appear to be at higher risk due to more negative intrapleural pressure in the lung apices. $#(Choice B)# Centriacinar emphysema occurs as the larger proximal bronchioles are destroyed, usually as a result of exposure to tobacco smoke in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It predominantly affects the upper lung lobe and initially spares the superficial alveoli. $#(Choice C)# Compensatory hyperinflation results when normal lung parenchyma expands in response to loss of adjacent lung volume (eg, segmental/lobar collapse or surgical removal). PSP results in collapse of adjacent lung tissue due to extrinsic compression by intrapleural air and does not result in parenchymal expansion. $#(Choice D)# Obstructive hyperinflation occurs when a lung segment expands due to a partial obstruction (eg, bronchogenic carcinoma) of the airway supplying it. On inspiration, the airway expands, which allows the movement of air into the segment; however, as the airway closes on expiration, air is trapped behind the obstruction. In an otherwise healthy young patient, it is unlikely to be the cause of PSP. $#(Choice E)# Panacinar emphysema occurs more commonly in the lower zones and anterior margins of the lungs.

  "explanation_2": "This patient with progressive dyspnea and cough has nodular pleural thickening and a pleural effusion. This presentation, in conjunction with characteristic pathology findings, suggests mesothelioma. #Mesothelioma# is a rare, malignant neoplasm arising from @mesothelial cells@ that line body cavities (eg, pleural, peritoneal, pericardial) and are characterized by numerous #long, slender microvilli# and abundant #tonofilaments#. Histopathology of the tumor cells can show an @epithelioid@ (ie, epithelium-like) and/or sarcomatoid (ie, spindle-shaped) appearance. Immunohistochemical markers (eg, cytokeratin, calretinin) are useful in diagnosis. $Mesothelioma typically presents with slowly progressive #dyspnea#, #cough#, and chest pain. Pleural effusions are common and are often #hemorrhagic#. Radiography may demonstrate nodular or smooth, unilateral #pleural thickening# and @plaque formation@; the lung parenchyma is typically uninvolved. #Asbestos# exposure is the primary risk factor; individuals involved in asbestos mining and industrial applications (eg, insulation, shipbuilding) are at risk for mesothelioma. $#(Choice A)# @Adenocarcinoma@ cells (which typically form glands and/or produce mucin) have short, plump microvilli that distinguish them from mesothelioma cells. Adenocarcinoma tends to involve peripheral lung parenchyma. $#(Choice B)# Pulmonary @carcinoid tumors@ are neuroendocrine neoplasms that tend to involve the large bronchi. Histopathology typically shows uniform tumor cells with a 'salt and pepper' chromatin pattern (ie, with fine and coarse clumps). $#(Choice D)# @Small cell carcinoma@ is associated with smoking but usually arises from the major bronchi. On chest imaging, it is seen as a hilar mass. Histopathology shows small, blue, oval-shaped tumor cells with scant cytoplasm. Neuroendocrine markers (eg, chromogranin, synaptophysin) are usually positive. $#(Choice E)# @Squamous cell carcinoma@ is associated with smoking but arises from the major bronchi; a hilar mass would be expected on imaging. Although desmosomes (intercellular bridges) can be seen in squamous cell carcinoma, imaging usually shows a central hilar mass (not pleural thickening). $#Educational objective# Malignant mesothelioma is a rare neoplasm typically arising from the pleura.

Activated macrophages can ectopically produce ACE and #1-alpha-hydroxylase# (increases production of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, the active form of vitamin D). This results in high ACE levels and hypercalcemia commonly seen in patients with sarcoidosis. Any organ can be affected; however, the lungs (interstitial lung disease), lymph nodes (hilar adenopathy), skin (nodular rash), and eyes (anterior uveitis) are most commonly involved. $Sarcoidosis may resemble other interstitial lung diseases (eg, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia). In such cases, quantification of the CD4+/CD8+ ratio in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid may help in determining the diagnosis. Sarcoidosis is a #CD4+ T-cell–mediated disease# in which large amounts of CD4+ lymphocytes release interferon-gamma and TNF-alpha to drive macrophage activation and granuloma formation. Therefore, the BAL fluid in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis demonstrates a lymphocytic predominance with a #high CD4+/CD8+ ratio# (>2:1). $#(Choice B)# CD8+ cells predominate in the BAL fluid of patients with hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Although this patient has an exposure risk for hypersensitivity pneumonitis (bird handling), her hilar adenopathy as well as elevated serum calcium and ACE levels make sarcoidosis more likely. $#(Choice C)# CD19, CD20, and CD22 are markers for the B-cell lineage. Precursor B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (CD22–) may sometimes involve the pleura or present as diffuse, patchy pulmonary infiltrates. In such cases, the BAL fluid might contain CD22– lymphocytes; however, elevated ACE and calcium levels suggest sarcoidosis. $#(Choice D)# BAL fluid eosinophilia is found in eosinophilic pneumonias and tropical pulmonary eosinophilia. Although patients with hypersensitivity pneumonitis may have elevations in circulating eosinophils, they do not have elevated eosinophil counts in their BAL fluid. $#(Choice E)# Even though the quantity of mast cells in BAL fluid may be elevated in various pulmonary diseases, there are few, if any, conditions reported to have a predominance of such cells. $#(Choice F)# Neutrophils would predominate in patients with bacterial pneumonias. $#Educational objective# Sarcoidosis is a CD4+ T-cell mediated disease, in which large numbers of CD4+ lymphocytes release interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha to drive macrophage activation and granuloma formation.

His advanced age, multiple comorbidities, and partial immune suppression secondary to chronic oral corticosteroid use also place him at risk for reactivation disease. $Primary tuberculosis infection occurs following inhalation of aerosolized #Mycobacterium tuberculosis#. The organisms are deposited in the lower lungs and phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages, where they proliferate until the macrophages are activated by TH1 lymphocytes. The infection can be subsequently eliminated if the area of involvement is small enough. However, larger regions of caseating necrosis become walled off, allowing #M tuberculosis# to survive in a dormant state without causing disease or symptoms. Later in life (usually following immunosuppression by drugs or HIV) the bacteria can #reactivate# and establish infection in the #upper lungs# (particularly the apex). The predilection for upper lung regions may be related to decreased lymphatic flow or increased oxygen tension. The organisms multiply in the apices, causing caseous and liquefactive necrosis and extensive #cavitary disease#. Erosion into the pulmonary vessels can result in severe hemoptysis. Hematogenous dissemination may also occur, causing miliary or extrapulmonary (eg, Potts disease, tuberculous meningitis) tuberculosis. $#(Choice A)# Primary tuberculosis infection often begins as a focal lesion in the mid-to-lower lungs (Ghon focus). #M tuberculosis# then spreads lymphatically to the hilar lymph nodes, forming a Ghon complex. The organisms can remain dormant in a walled-off Ghon complex for many years before reactivating. Alternatively, the lesion may heal, forming a benign, calcified Ranke complex that is not associated with reactivation tuberculosis. $#(Choice B)# A Ghon complex forms during primary tuberculosis infection and consists of a Ghon focus and hilar lymphadenopathy. This patient's upper lung involvement and cavitary lesion are more characteristic of secondary (reactivation) tuberculosis. Healing of this lesion would result in a persistent cavity that may become secondarily infected with Aspergillus flavus and form fungus balls. $#(Choice D)# #M tuberculosis# is a facultative intracellular bacterium that can survive and multiply within macrophages; as a result, circulating antibodies cannot bind it to promote phagocytosis or complement-mediated killing. Therefore, humoral immunity plays no role in the control of #M tuberculosis#. $#(Choice E)# A negative skin tuberculin test after #M tuberculosis# exposure suggests anergy against tuberculosis antigens and a weak cell-mediated immune response. This can occur in the setting of HIV, sarcoidosis, and other illnesses. $#Educational objective# Primary tuberculosis causes the formation of Ghon foci in the lower lungs. Secondary (reactivation) tuberculosis occurs in patients with prior tuberculosis infection that never cleared completely. Reactivation tuberculosis occurs most often in immunosuppressed patients and is characterized by apical cavitary lesions and hemoptysis."

  "explanation_2": "$ This contrast-enhanced CT image reveals a large filling defect within the lumen of the pulmonary artery, which is consistent with #pulmonary embolism# (PE).  The thromboembolus usually originates in the deep veins of the lower extremities and travels through the inferior vena cava and right side of the heart to reach the pulmonary circulation.  Large emboli lodge in the pulmonary artery bifurcation ('saddle emboli') and may cause severe hypotension or sudden cardiac death, whereas smaller emboli occlude peripheral pulmonary arterial branches.  In most cases, pulmonary emboli are multiple, with the lower lobes involved more often than the upper lobes. $ Many hospitalized patients are at increased risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) (ie, PE or deep vein thrombosis) due to trauma, prolonged immobilization, or underlying conditions that contribute to a hypercoagulable state (eg, cancer, infection, pregnancy).  Patients undergoing large orthopedic surgeries (eg, hip replacement) are at particularly #high risk of VTE#.  Although the risk of VTE in hospitalized patients cannot be completely eliminated, administration of prophylactic #anticoagulation greatly reduces risk#.  Low-molecular-weight heparin (eg, enoxaparin) is preferred in most patients due to proven efficacy and relatively low risk of adverse effects. $ In patients at high risk of VTE, the slightly increased risk of bleeding is strongly outweighed by the reduced risk of VTE (and its associated mortality) provided by prophylactic anticoagulation.  Early ambulation also helps reduce the risk of VTE. $ (Choice A)  Beta-adrenergic antagonists (eg, metoprolol) may lower the risk of perioperative myocardial infarction or aortic dissection, but they do not reduce the risk of VTE. $ (Choice B)  Fresh frozen plasma is used to reverse the effects of warfarin or to provide coagulation factors to patients experiencing massive hemorrhage.  It does not reduce the risk of VTE and may even exacerbate an underlying hypercoagulable state. $ (Choice C)  Intravenous hydration can help prevent perioperative dehydration and prerenal acute kidney injury. $ (Choice E)  Perioperative antibiotics (eg, cefazolin) may help prevent surgical wound infections. $ (Choice F)  Tissue plasminogen activator is indicated in the treatment of massive PE complicated by hemodynamic instability.  However, it is not appropriate for VTE prophylaxis due to the relatively high risk of serious bleeding complications (eg, intracranial hemorrhage). $ Educational objective The risk of venous thromboembolism (ie, pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis) in hospitalized patients can be greatly reduced with the administration of prophylactic anticoagulation, usually with low-molecular-weight heparin."

  "explanation_2": "$A history of prolonged bleeding following procedures (eg, dental extractions, surgeries) and spontaneous hemorrhages into the joints (hemarthrosis) is typical for #hemophilia#, an X-linked recessive bleeding disorder due to decreased levels of factor VIII (hemophilia A) or factor IX (hemophilia B). $ Factors VIII and IX are components of the intrinsic coagulation pathway and activate factor X; activated factor X (Xa) then catalyzes the conversion of prothrombin (factor II) into thrombin as part of the final common pathway.  In the absence of factors VIII or IX, activation of factor X and subsequent conversion of prothrombin into thrombin do not occur.  Administration of #thrombin#, however, will make up for the deficiency and lead to blood clotting.  In practice, prothrombin complex concentrates (containing factors II, VII, IX, and X, which lead to thrombin formation) were used for management of hemophilia B, although thrombogenic risks have limited their application. $ In both types of hemophilia, the bleeding time and platelet count are normal.  The prothrombin time (PT) is also normal as it tests the #e#xtrinsic clotting pathway and reflects the function of factors II, V, VII, and X (mnemonic: P#e#T).  However, the activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is prolonged as it assesses the activity of factors II, V, VIII, IX, X, XI and XII, the #i#ntrinsic clotting pathway (mnemonic: P#i#TT).  Diagnoses of hemophilia A and B are made by measuring plasma levels of factors VIII and IX, respectively. $ (Choice A)  Factor XII (Hageman) is synthesized by the liver and is activated by endothelial injury.  It triggers the intrinsic coagulation pathway by activating factor XI.  The addition of factor XII does not clot the blood of patients with hemophilia because the downstream clotting factors VIII or IX are deficient. $ (Choice B)  Fibrinogen is a protein synthesized by the liver.  Thrombin mediates cleavage of fibrinogen to form fibrin, the main component of thrombi; therefore, without thrombin, fibrinogen administration alone would not be helpful. $ (Choice C)  Protein C is a vitamin K-dependent factor synthesized in the liver.  It is a physiologic anticoagulant that degrades factors Va and VIIIa. $ (Choice E)  Urokinase is a thrombolytic agent used for treatment of myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolism.  It acts by converting plasminogen to plasmin, which then breaks down fibrinogen and fibrin into their respective degradation products.  The addition of urokinase would prevent thrombosis. $ Educational objective Bleeding after a tooth extraction and history of hemarthrosis are suggestive of hemophilia.  Decreased levels of factor VIII or IX lead to failure to convert prothrombin into thrombin and deficient thrombus formation.  The addition of thrombin to the blood of a patient with hemophilia results in clotting."

In general, >25% bone marrow lymphoblasts are seen in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, which is much more common in young children. $ (Choice B)  Acute myelogenous leukemia is the most common acute leukemia in adults.  However, the mean age at diagnosis is around 65, and most patients will have a WBC count of about 15,000-20,000/mm3 with a significant increase in blast cells (eg, >20%) rather than the 1% seen in this patient. $ #(Choices C, F, and G)#  Follicular lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cause lymph node and/or soft-tissue (not peripheral blood) abnormalities.  In addition, these cancers are all lymphoid, not myeloid, in nature. $ (Choice D)  Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia have increased circulating mature lymphoid cells, not increased myeloid cells. $ (Choices H and J)  Parasitic superinfection (which can lead to eosinophilia) and fungal infection would not explain the predominance of myeloid neutrophil precursor forms in this patient. $ Educational objective Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and leukemoid reaction can have presentations similar to leukocytosis; however, leukocyte (neutrophil) alkaline phosphatase level is normal or elevated in a leukemoid reaction but decreased in CML.  The definitive diagnosis of CML requires demonstration of the Philadelphia chromosome t(9;22) or BCR-ABL fusion gene or mRNA."

His #bleeding# from venous puncture sites is highly suggestive of #disseminated intravascular coagulation# (DIC), a consumptive coagulopathy associated with #sepsis#, malignancy, trauma, and obstetric complications. $ In DIC due to gram-negative sepsis, the coagulation cascade is activated by bacterial endotoxins, leading to widespread fibrin deposition and the consumption of coagulation factors and platelets, with eventual bleeding.  Deposition of fibrin strands in small vessels can cause shearing of circulating erythrocytes, resulting in @schistocytes@ (fragmented erythrocytes) on peripheral smear.

  "explanation_2": "Deficiencies of folic acid and vitamin B12 are the most important causes of megaloblastic anemia.  Both of these vitamins are required for DNA synthesis in erythropoiesis.  When there is a deficiency of either of these vitamins, cell division is delayed, though the cytoplasm develops normally.  Thus, the cells enlarge (megaloblasts) but do not divide.  The bone marrow is hypercellular in megaloblastic anemia, but the megaloblastic erythroid precursor cells are rapidly destroyed in the bone marrow and few differentiated large RBCs are released into the circulation.  In severe megaloblastic anemia, 90% of erythroid precursors are destroyed without ever entering the circulation. $ Vitamin B12 and folic acid deficiencies cause similar hematological pictures.  However, neurological dysfunction is only seen in patients with vitamin B12 deficiency.  This is because B12 deficiency also causes axonal demyelination and degeneration.  In late disease, the neurological dysfunction may be irreversible.  The main sites of neurological involvement include the peripheral nerves, spinal cord (posterior and lateral columns), and the cerebrum.  Decreased vibratory and position sense are early signs of vitamin B12 deficiency.  Patients experience ataxia and recurrent falls because of compromised proprioception.  Importantly, neurologic abnormalities can occur in vitamin B12 deficiency in the absence of frank anemia.  Treating megaloblastic anemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency with folate alone could worsen the neurological dysfunction. $ An RBC mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of more than 100 fL is suggestive of megaloblastic anemia.  However, RBC macrocytosis can also occur in liver disease, hypothyroidism, and alcohol-induced liver disease.  MCVs greater than 110 fL are typically seen only with vitamin B12 and folic acid anemias.  On peripheral blood smear, there is macrocytosis (large RBCs), hypersegmented neutrophils, and large bizarrely shaped platelets.  The presence of even a single neutrophil with more than 6 lobes should raise the suspicion of megaloblastic anemia. $ The medications listed in the other answer choices are not used for the treatment of megaloblastic anemia.$ Educational Objective Vitamin B12 and folic acid deficiencies cause similar hematological pictures.  However, neurological dysfunction is only seen in patients with vitamin B12 deficiency.  If megaloblastic anemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency is mistakenly treated with folate alone, the neurologic dysfunction can worsen."

Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections dramatically increase the risk of HCC.  Ongoing infection with either virus leads to #increased hepatocyte turnover#, which increases the risk for genetic mutations and malignant transformation.  However, #HBV# has several additional mechanisms that promote HCC, including the following: $ • #Integration into the host genome# – Nearly 90% of patients with chronic HBV who develop HCC have evidence of HBV DNA in the chromosomes of tumor cells.  HBV is a partially double-stranded DNA virus that is repaired to form a closed circular DNA strand.  HBV DNA is often inserted into the cellular genome, although this is not required for viral replication (unlike HIV).  Integration into regions that control cell growth and differentiation can result in tumorigenesis. $ • #Production of oncogenic viral proteins# – HBV produces a viral protein called #HBx# that is a transcriptional activator of several genes associated with cellular growth.

A minority of patients develop invasive disease with liver abscess.  This usually presents with fever and right-upper quadrant pain; the organism does not incorporate its genome into host cells. $ (Choice E)  Chronic HCV infection dramatically increases the risk of HCC.  However, HCV is an RNA virus (that does not have reverse transcriptase) and is unable to integrate into the host genome. $ (Choice F)  Human papilloma virus is a double-stranded DNA virus of the papillomavirus family.  HPV produces oncogenic proteins and is able to integrate into the host chromosome.  However, HPV is not linked with liver cancer; it typically causes cervical and oropharyngeal cancer. $ Educational objective Both hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C virus infections increase the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma due to chronic hepatic inflammation and cell turnover.  HBV is also carcinogenic due to the production of oncogenic proteins and the insertion of the HBV genome into host chromosomes.",

  "explanation_2": "This patient with pancytopenia has inappropriately low reticulocyte count, morphologically normal cell lines on peripheral smear, and no splenomegaly on physical examination, raising strong suspicion for #aplastic anemia#. $ Aplastic anemia is a form of bone marrow failure caused by direct toxic injury or cytotoxic T-cell destruction of multipotent hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow.  Because these stem cells generate progenitor cells that produce all blood cells, damage results in a dramatic reduction of immature and mature blood cells in the bone marrow and peripheral blood.  This is reflected on @bone marrow biopsy@ as #marked hypocellularity# with an abundance of #fat cells# and other marrow #stroma#; aspiration classically produces a ‘#dry tap#’. $ Although aplastic anemia is usually idiopathic (no clear cause), it can be triggered by viral infection (eg, hepatitis, HIV), chemical or radiation exposure, or medications (eg, carbamazepine).  Patients typically have manifestations of #pancytopenia# such as severe fatigue and pale mucous membranes (anemia), bleeding/bruising (thrombocytopenia), or infection (eg, leukopenia).  No significant extramedullary hematopoiesis occurs (eg, #no splenomegaly#) because few hematopoietic stem cells continue to function. $ (Choice A)  Acute leukemias (eg, @acute myeloid leukemia@) are usually associated with a hypercellular marrow with increased blasts.

In addition, blasts would be seen on peripheral smear. $ (Choice B)  @Chronic myeloid leukemia@, a myeloproliferative neoplasm of granulocytes associated with the BCR-ABL fusion gene, is marked by a hypercellular marrow with increased granulocytes and megakaryocytes.  Patients typically have significant peripheral leukocytosis and thrombocytosis; in addition, hepatosplenomegaly is generally present. $ (Choice D)  @Myelofibrosis@, a chronic hematopoietic neoplasm, is marked by hypocellular marrow with extensive fibrosis.  Although pancytopenia is typically present, peripheral blood smear usually shows teardrop-shaped and nucleated erythrocytes; significant extramedullary hematopoiesis also occurs, so dramatic splenomegaly is usually present. $ (Choice E)  @Acute promyelocytic leukemia@ is associated with promyelocytes with Auer rods (rod-shaped cytoplasmic inclusions).  This type of acute myeloid leukemia is characterized clinically by disseminated intravascular coagulation (acquired hypercoagulability and bleeding), which is not seen in this patient (normal PT and PTT); immature leukocytes would also be seen on peripheral smear. $ Educational objective Aplastic anemia is a form of bone marrow failure due to destruction of multipotent hematopoietic stem cells.

MM does not typically cause pericardial disease; therefore, it is not associated with cardiac tamponade. $ (Choice C)  Hepatic failure is most often linked to viral hepatitis or chronic alcohol use.  It occasionally occurs due to malignant infiltration of the liver (eg, lymphoma, breast cancer); however, risk of hepatic failure with MM is low; amyloidosis is a far more common complication. $ (Choice D)  Hyperthyroidism is most often due to Graves disease, an autoimmune disorder that generates TSH-receptor antibodies.  It can also be seen with medications (eg, lithium) and tumors that produce TSH (eg, pituitary adenoma).  MM is not linked to hyperthyroidism. $ (Choice E)  Meningeal carcinomatosis is a rare condition associated with some solid tumors (eg, breast cancer, lung cancer, melanoma).  Tumor spread to the leptomeninges can cause mass effect (eg, headache, hydrocephalus), cranial/spinal nerve dysfunction, and focal neurologic issues.  MM does not typically spread to the leptomeninges. $ (Choice F)  Atraumatic splenic rupture can occur with leukemia and lymphoma due to massive splenomegaly from extramedullary hematopoiesis and/or underlying tumor infiltration.  MM does not typically cause significant extramedullary hematopoiesis and usually replicates in the bone marrow, not the spleen. $ Educational objective Amyloid light-chain amyloidosis is associated with multiple myeloma and other monoclonal plasma cell dyscrasias due to the deposition of insoluble immunoglobulin light-chain fibrils in major organs (eg, kidneys, heart, neurologic system).

These findings are concerning for #acute leukemia#, which occurs due to clonal expansion of hematopoietic progenitor cells (ie, blast cells).  Blasts may be either lymphoid or myeloid in origin.  Immunophenotyping (eg, flow cytometry) is used to characterize blast cells and classify acute leukemia. $ This patient's cells are lymphoid in origin.  Lymphoid cells typically lack myeloperoxidase (MPO), an enzyme involved in microbial killing by myeloid derivatives (eg, neutrophils).  Immature lymphocytes (@lymphoblasts@) can be differentiated from mature lymphocytes by the presence of #terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase# (TdT); TdT is a DNA polymerase involved in V(D)J recombination, which generates antigen receptor diversity during #early lymphoid maturation#.

Although the malignant cells express B-cell markers (eg, CD19), they do not express TdT because the cell of origin is a mature, not a progenitor, B cell. $ (Choice D)  Mature T-cell leukemia is derived from mature or postthymic T cells, and immunophenotyping would reveal the presence of T-cell markers (eg, CD3) and the absence of TdT.  Moreover, this is an uncommon neoplasm typically seen in adults, not young children. $ (Choice E)  Immunophenotyping of cells in T-ALL, which typically presents in adolescents with a mediastinal mass, would show expression of TdT but would also express T-cell, not B-cell, markers. $ Educational objective Acute lymphoblastic leukemia typically presents with signs/symptoms of bone marrow failure (eg, bleeding due to thrombocytopenia).

In the mitochondrial pathway, caspase activation occurs via the movement of cytochrome c protein from the mitochondrial intermembrane space to the cytoplasm.  The BCL2 protein family regulates the ability of cytochrome c to permeate the mitochondrial outer membrane.  This protein family includes both proapoptotic members (eg, BAX, BAK), which increase the permeability of the membrane via pore formation, and #antiapoptotic# members (eg, #BCL2#, BCL-XL), which preserve membrane integrity and #prevent the release of cytochrome c#. $ The characteristic cytogenetic abnormality associated with #follicular lymphoma#, a mature B-cell lymphoma, is a translocation involving the BCL2 gene on chromosome 18 and the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene on chromosome 14 [t(14;18)].

  "explanation_2": "This patient with a #low hemoglobin level# has several symptoms of #anemia#, including generalized weakness, tachycardia, and conjunctival pallor.  The presence of #spontaneous bruising# in the absence of trauma likely indicates #thrombocytopenia#.  Bone marrow aspirate reveals an abundance of lipids instead of cells, which is usually seen with #bone marrow aplasia or hypoplasia#.  This constellation of findings is highly suggestive of #aplastic anemia# (AA). $ AA is a form of bone marrow failure primarily caused by cytotoxic T-cell destruction of multipotent hematologic stem cells.  Because multipotent stem cells produce all mature blood cells, patients usually develop #pancytopenia# (not just anemia as the name suggests) and have manifestations of anemia, thrombocytopenia, and/or leukopenia (eg, infections). $ As with most forms of anemia, anemia-induced tissue hypoxia stimulates interstitial cells in the kidney to #increase the release of erythropoietin#.  However, in AA, erythropoietin is unable to stimulate significant new red blood cell production due to the reduced population of functioning hematologic stem cells; therefore, #reticulocytes are inappropriately low#.  Because the blood cells produced by the remaining undamaged hematopoietic stem cells are normal in morphology, erythrocytes are normal in size and appearance; therefore, #mean corpuscular volume is normal#.  Because there is no intravascular hemolysis, #haptoglobin# (binds free hemoglobin in the blood) is also #normal#. $ Educational objective Aplastic anemia (AA) is a form of bone marrow failure associated with pancytopenia and bone marrow aplasia/hypoplasia.  Although erythropoietin levels are high, reticulocytes remain low because the production of new erythrocytes is impaired by a paucity of bone marrow stem cells.  However, the blood cells produced by the remaining stem cells are normal in morphology and red cell indexes (eg, mean corpuscular volume) are usually normal."

The bone marrow normally releases immature erythrocytes (reticulocytes) in response to severe anemia to compensate for lost oxygen-carrying capacity.  For this reason, a high reticulocyte count suggests the anemia is due to a process outside the bone marrow, such as acute bleeding or hemolysis (eg, intravascular or splenic erythrocyte destruction) #(choice D)#.  In contrast, an #inappropriately low reticulocyte count# (as in this case) suggests a problem with the production of red blood cells in the bone marrow, which may be caused by 1 of the following: $ • #Low erythropoietin# (EPO):  EPO is primarily produced in the cortical peritubular cells of the kidneys.  It travels to the bone marrow, where it stimulates the division and differentiation of erythroid progenitor cells.  A low level of EPO is primarily caused by fibrosis of the peritubular cells due to chronic renal failure.  This patient with a normal creatinine level is very unlikely to have low EPO #(choice B)#. $ • #Lack of nutrients# (eg, vitamin B12, folate, iron):  Efficient erythropoiesis requires adequate levels of vitamin B12, folate, and iron.  Significant deficiencies in these nutrients usually alter the size of mature erythrocytes, leading to changes in mean corpuscular volume (MCV).  Low vitamin B12 or folate eventually causes macrocytosis (high MCV), and low iron eventually causes microcytosis (low MCV). $ • #Destruction of erythrocyte precursors:#  Viruses (eg, parvovirus B19), medications, and #autoantibodies# can destroy erythrocyte progenitor cells, leading to severe anemia with morphologically normal platelets and leukocytes (ie, #red cell aplasia#).  This condition is common with certain tumor types, namely lymphoproliferative disorders (eg, chronic lymphocytic leukemia) and #thymoma#.  Thymoma often causes #mediastinal mass# with pulmonary symptoms (eg, #persistent nonproductive cough#) due to infringement on adjacent airways. $ Educational objective Pure red cell aplasia is a rare form of bone marrow failure characterized by severe anemia with reticulocytopenia and morphologically normal platelets and leukocytes.

  "explanation_2": "#Polycythemia vera# (PV) is a clonal myeloproliferative disease of pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells.  Approximately 95% of patients with PV have a V617F mutation involving the JAK2 gene, a signal transduction molecule that stimulates cell growth.  This mutation replaces a valine with phenylalanine, allowing #constitutive proliferation# of hematopoietic cells #independent# of circulating growth factor (eg, erythropoietin, thrombopoietin) levels. $ PV presents with #increased RBC mass# and low erythropoietin levels.  Additional manifestations can include an #elevated platelet# and/or #WBC count#, thrombotic events (from blood hyperviscosity), peptic ulceration and aquagenic pruritus (due to histamine release from basophils), and gouty arthritis (from increased cell turnover). $ Physical examination typically shows a plethoric, reddened face and splenomegaly.  Diagnosis is established by confirming low serum erythropoietin levels and cytogenetic studies showing a #JAK2 mutation#.  Treatment involves serial phlebotomy as necessary to keep the hematocrit < 45%. $ (Choice A)  Dehydration or excessive diuresis can also cause elevated hematocrit, mild leukocytosis, and thrombocytosis due to low effective circulating volume.  However, splenomegaly and symptoms such as pruritus would not be seen.  $(Choice B)  Hypoxia is a strong stimulus for erythropoietin production.  SaO2 < 92% (PaO2 < 65 mm Hg) appears to be the threshold for the development of (physiologic) secondary polycythemia.  Conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and obstructive sleep apnea can cause secondary polycythemia.  However, these will not cause leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, or splenomegaly. $ (Choice D)  Increased red cell life span would not be expected to cause leukocytosis and thrombocytosis. $ (Choice E)  EPO-producing tumors (eg, renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma) can cause secondary polycythemia due to abnormal erythropoietin production.  Workup will show an elevated erythropoietin level.  However, the combination of multiple elevated cell lines and splenomegaly is unlikely to result from a process causing secondary polycythemia. $ Educational objective Polycythemia vera (PV) is a clonal myeloproliferative disease characterized by an increased RBC mass and low erythropoietin levels.  PV can be differentiated from secondary polycythemia by the presence of leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, and/or splenomegaly.  The majority of patients with PV have a JAK2 mutation causing hematopoietic stem cells to proliferate uncontrollably."

Depending on the subtype, NHL may present with a rapidly progressive mass, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and B symptoms (eg, night sweats, weight loss).  Diagnosis is typically made with excisional lymph node biopsy, which usually demonstrates a loss of normal tissue architecture with expansion of abnormal lymphocytes (most often B cells, as in this patient with @large, atypical B cells@). $ Lymphoma is frequently associated with #Epstein-Barr virus# (EBV), a ubiquitous herpesvirus that primarily infects B lymphocytes and causes persistent latent infections.

EBV is particularly associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, and some forms of NHL (eg, Burkitt lymphoma).  $ Patients with #HIV# are at greatest risk for EBV-associated lymphomas (risk is up to 60-fold greater).

Their use is not linked to an increased risk of NHL.  $(Choice C)  Cigarette smoking is a strong risk factor for the development of many types of cancer (eg, lung, bladder, pancreas) but is not closely linked with the development of NHL.  $(Choice D)  The link between radiation exposure and the development of NHL is controversial.  However, most studies indicate that this is not a strong risk factor.  $ (Choice E)  Although lower socioeconomic status may be associated with worse outcomes in patients with NHL, this marker has not been closely linked with the development of NHL.  $Educational objective Patients with HIV have much higher rates of lymphoma than the general population.

The term ‘bleeding time’ refers to this particular test and not the duration of bleeding, which can be prolonged from other coagulopathies. $ #von Willebrand disease (vWD)# will cause both a prolonged PTT and bleeding time.  @von Willebrand factor (vWF)@ is produced by endothelial cells and megakaryocytes and functions as a #carrier protein for factor VIII# and as a #mediator of platelet adhesion# to the endothelium.  Absence of vWF leads to impaired platelet function and coagulation pathway abnormalities.  vWD is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion with variable penetrance and is the #most common heritable bleeding disorder#. $ (Choice A)  Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) is a consumptive coagulopathy most commonly seen in septic shock.  PT, PTT, and bleeding time are prolonged, and the D-dimer, a degradation product of cross-linked fibrin, is elevated.  $(Choice B)  Dysfibrinogenemias are inherited abnormalities in the fibrinogen molecule that can cause excessive bleeding or thrombophilia.  TT, PT, and PTT are abnormal in this condition, but bleeding time is unaffected. $ (Choice C)  Factor XIII is a transglutaminase that cross-links fibrin polymers, thereby stabilizing clots.  Factor XIII deficiency causes spontaneous or excessive bleeding, but it would not prolong the bleeding time, PT, or PTT.  $(Choice D)  Hemophilia A is an X-linked hereditary deficiency of factor VIII that causes coagulopathy with a prolonged PTT but shows normal bleeding time.  $(Choice E)  Hemophilia B is an X-linked hereditary deficiency of factor IX that causes coagulopathy with a prolonged PTT but shows normal bleeding time.  $ (Choice F)  Vitamin K is required for activation of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X.  Vitamin K deficiency causes a coagulopathy that primarily prolongs PT, with PTT prolongation occurring in severe cases.  Bleeding time is not affected.  $Educational objective von Willebrand disease is the most common inherited bleeding disorder.  It has an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and variable penetrance.  Absence of von Willebrand factor leads to impaired platelet function (prolonged bleeding time) and coagulation pathway abnormalities due to decreased factor VIII activity (prolonged partial thromboplastin time).",

These early hematologic precursors normally comprise a small percentage in the bone marrow but, with malignant transformation, can proliferate and be detected in peripheral blood (eg, acute leukemia). $ The presence of myeloperoxidase (MPO) helps determine whether blasts are lymphoid or myeloid in origin.  Because MPO is an enzyme involved in microbial killing by myeloid derivatives (eg, neutrophils), it is absent in lymphoid cells.  In addition, positive #terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase# (TdT) indicates lymphoblasts; TdT is a DNA polymerase involved in #V(D)J recombination#, which generates antigen receptor diversity during early lymphoid maturation.  Therefore, negative MPO and positive TdT confirm that these are #lymphoblasts#. $ Lymphoblasts are further differentiated by markers unique to B (eg, CD19) or T (eg, #CD3#) cells.  This patient's CD3-positive lymphoblasts indicate #T-lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL)#.  Unlike B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), which usually occurs in early childhood, T-ALL is most common in #adolescence#.

However, expression of B-cell surface markers (eg, CD19) would be expected.  In addition, presentation usually involves signs of bone marrow failure (eg, pallor, bruising) in young children, not a mediastinal mass in an adolescent. $ (Choice C)  @Burkitt lymphoma@, a malignancy derived from mature B cells, can present with disseminated disease involving the bone marrow.  An enlarging mass can be seen, but it is usually in the abdomen or jaw, not the mediastinum.  Cells express B-cell, not T-cell, markers.  Because Burkitt lymphoma is composed of mature B cells, TdT is negative. $ (Choice D)  @Hodgkin lymphoma@ can present with a mediastinal mass and painless lymphadenopathy.  Circulating blasts are not typical.  Instead, Reed-Sternberg cells (large cells with multilobated nuclei and eosinophilic nucleoli) within lymph nodes are characteristic.

SLE frequently causes anemia due to a combination of factors, including chronic inflammation (anemia of chronic disease), gastrointestinal serositis (iron deficiency from bleeding), and/or #autoimmune hemolytic anemia# (AIHA). $ Approximately 10% of patients with SLE develop AIHA due to immune dysregulation, which results in the formation of #IgG autoantibodies# against the erythrocyte membrane.  Erythrocytes coated with IgG are subsequently identified by the Fc-receptor on #splenic macrophages# and partially or wholly phagocytized, leading to extravascular hemolysis.  Laboratory assessment typically reveals #elevated reticulocyte count# (ie, reticulocytosis) because interstitial fibroblasts in the kidney sense tissue hypoxia and increase the release of erythropoietin; this drives the bone marrow to increase erythrocytosis, leading to the presence of immature red cells in the peripheral blood (normoblasts, reticulocytes). $ #(Choices A and C)#  The presence of significant reticulocytosis (eg, >4-5%) rules out causes of anemia associated with an impaired bone marrow response, including bone marrow suppression from cancer or infection (eg, parvovirus), anemia of chronic disease (cytokine-mediated retention of iron), and vitamin deficiency (eg, vitamin B12 deficiency from intrinsic factor antibodies, iron deficiency).  $(Choice D)  A normal platelet count effectively rules out anemia due to a microangiopathic process associated with intravascular platelet consumption (eg, thrombotic microangiopathy). $ (Choice E)  Although traumatic intravascular hemolysis can occur with a mechanical heart valve or severe aortic stenosis, it is uncommon in otherwise healthy young individuals.  Furthermore, this patient's heart murmur is most consistent with mitral valve prolapse, which is common in patients with SLE but rarely causes traumatic hemolysis. $ Educational objective Anemia with an elevated reticulocyte count (ie, reticulocytosis) indicates that the bone marrow is responding appropriately to the anemia by generating new erythrocytes.  Reticulocytosis is commonly seen in patients with hemolysis or acute bleeding.  Many other causes of anemia are associated with low reticulocyte count, including bone marrow suppression (eg, parvovirus), iron deficiency anemia, vitamin B12/folate deficiency, and anemia of chronic disease."

Interestingly, patients who harbor this gene fusion are usually young non-smokers, often with adenocarcinoma, who lack mutations in either the epidermal growth factor receptor gene or the K-ras gene.  The kinase activity of this fusion protein is a target of the protein kinase inhibitor, crizotinib.$ The pathophysiology of EML4-ALK NSCLC is most similar to the pathophysiology of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).  In CML, the classic and most common cause is a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22.  The ABL proto-oncogene is transported from chromosome 9 to chromosome 22 where it is placed adjacent to the BCR gene.  The resulting oncogene, BCR-ABL, codes for a fusion protein with constitutive tyrosine kinase activity.  This protein stimulates the proliferation of granulocytic precursors and leads to the development of CML.  The kinase activity of this fusion protein is a target of the protein kinase inhibitor, imatinib.  $ (Choice A)  Burkitt lymphoma is characterized by a translocation of the c-myc oncogene on the long arm of chromosome 8 to the Ig heavy chain region on chromosome 14.  This causes constitutive overproduction of c-myc, a nuclear phosphoprotein that functions as a transcription activator.  $(Choice C)  Patients with follicular lymphoma have a t(14;18) translocation that causes overexpression of the antiapoptotic BCL2 gene product.  $ (Choice D)  Li-Fraumeni syndrome is an autosomal dominant predisposition to a variety of cancers, particularly sarcomas and tumors of the breast, brain, and adrenal cortex.

  "explanation_2": "Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), characterized by failure of immature myeloid precursors (myeloblasts) to differentiate into mature granulocytes, is divided into 8 types (M0 through M7).  #Acute promyelocytic leukemia# (APML), the M3 variant of AML, is associated with the #t(15;17)# cytogenetic translocation involving the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene on chromosome 15 and the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) gene on chromosome 17.  Fusion of these 2 genes produces #PML/RARA#, a chimeric gene (illustrated in this @fluorescence in situ hybridization image@) that codes for an abnormal #retinoic acid receptor#, which then inhibits myeloblast differentiation.  Abnormal promyelocytes and Auer rods are seen on the smear.  $ The clinical manifestations of AML, including anemia (fatigue, pallor), thrombocytopenia (petechiae, hemorrhages), and neutropenia (fever, opportunistic infections), result from marrow replacement by leukemic cells.  As seen in this patient, APML is associated with #disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)#, which is characterized by activation of the coagulation cascade.  Laboratory findings seen in DIC include thrombocytopenia, elevated D-dimer due to fibrinolysis, and prolonged coagulation profile times (eg, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time) and low fibrinogen due to consumption.  $All-trans retinoic acid is used for treatment of APML. $ (Choice A)  Mutations in the genes that code for the epidermal growth factor receptors are associated with certain lung (ERBB1), breast (ERBB2, also known as HER2/neu), ovarian, and gastric tumors.  $ (Choice B)  GTP-binding proteins are involved in cellular signal transduction. $ (Choice C)  A defective platelet-derived growth factor receptor plays a role in the pathogenesis of several cancers, including ovarian cancers.  $ (Choice D)  An abnormal RB gene predisposes to development of retinoblastoma and osteosarcoma. $ Educational objective The cytogenetic defect t(15;17) is associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML).  A translocation involving the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) gene from chromosome 17 and the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene on chromosome 15 leads to the formation of PML/RARA, a fusion gene whose product inhibits differentiation of myeloblasts and triggers the development of APML.",

This patient's #male sex# and #family history# of #hemarthrosis# in a maternal male relative suggest an #X-linked coagulopathy# such as hemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency) or hemophilia B (factor IX deficiency, Christmas disease).  Hemophilia A and B are indistinguishable clinically as both demonstrate similar symptoms and inheritance patterns.  Both conditions are characterized by isolated prolongation of partial thromboplastin time due to defects in the @intrinsic coagulation pathway@.  Prothrombin time [PT] and thrombin time [TT] are normal in patients with hemophilia. $ When endothelial injury occurs, platelets are activated and form a hemostatic plug first, followed by activation of the coagulation cascade.  Patients with hemophilia have normal platelet function and can form a platelet plug, so bleeding after procedures can be delayed rather than immediate, in contrast to patients with platelet disorders.  Manifestations include #intramuscular hemorrhage#, hemarthrosis, and prolonged or #delayed bleeding# after surgical procedures.  $(Choice A)  Low haptoglobin is a sign of hemolytic anemia.  Other associated findings include increased indirect bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase. $ (Choice B)  This patient's hemoglobin level is likely normal since the oozing began recently and he has no history of chronic or recurrent bleeding. $ (Choice D)  Signs of thrombocytopenia include easy bruisability, petechiae, and mucocutaneous hemorrhage (eg, recurrent epistaxis, gingival hemorrhage).  The absence of petechiae and the delayed bleeding onset make a platelet disorder unlikely. $ (Choice E)  The platelet function analyzer (PFA-100) test monitors the time needed for a patient's blood to form a platelet-based hemostatic plug in an in vitro environment.  Abnormal results are seen in von Willebrand disease, inherited/acquired platelet dysfunction (eg, NSAID use), and thrombocytopenia. $ (Choice F)  PT reflects the extrinsic clotting pathway, which involves tissue factor, fibrinogen, and factors II, V, VII, and X.  Vitamin K deficiency and warfarin anticoagulant therapy are common causes of isolated PT prolongation as they lead to decreased activity of factors II, VII, IX, and X.  Inherited deficiencies of these clotting factors are very rare.  $(Choice G)  The TT measures the rate of conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin.  It is prolonged in patients with deficient or defective fibrinogen, which can be congenital or acquired.  The most common cause of acquired dysfibrinogenemia is liver disease. $ Educational objective Hemophilia is an X-linked recessive coagulopathy that presents with intramuscular hemorrhage, hemarthroses, and delayed bleeding after procedures.

It is decreased in iron deficiency and elevated in iron overload or during infection/inflammation (acute phase reaction).  Transferrin transports iron through the plasma.  When iron levels are normal, approximately one third of circulating transferrin is bound to iron.  In iron deficiency, hepatic synthesis of transferrin increases but transferrin saturation drops due to decreased release of iron into the plasma from intracellular stores. $ (Choice A)  The earliest signs of iron deficiency are low serum ferritin and high serum transferrin, which manifest before overt anemia develops.  This pattern of findings is more consistent with α- or β-thalassemia, which usually cause microcytic anemia with normal ferritin and transferrin levels.  $ (Choice D)  Low hemoglobin in the setting of a normal MCV, low circulating transferrin, and high serum ferritin is suggestive of anemia of chronic disease, which is often associated with infections and inflammatory conditions.  Other acute phase reactants (eg, C-reactive protein, sedimentation rate) are usually elevated in these patients.  $ #(Choices E and F)#  @Hypersegmented neutrophils@ are characteristic of megaloblastic anemias, which can be caused by folate and vitamin B12 deficiency.

These findings are suggestive of #vitamin C# (ascorbic acid) #deficiency (scurvy)#, which typically occurs due to insufficient intake (eg, chronic alcohol use, malnourishment, restrictive diets).  This patient's disorientation and thin body habitus are concerning for possible malnutrition and/or chronic substance use. $ Vitamin C is a #water-soluble# vitamin that functions as a cofactor in collagen synthesis.  #Impaired collagen synthesis# results in cutaneous signs of scurvy, including phrynoderma (perifollicular hyperkeratosis), coiled hair, and poor wound healing.  #Fragility of vasculature# due to poor connective tissue strength can lead to hemorrhagic complications involving the mucosa (eg, #gingival bleeding#), skin (eg, #ecchymoses, petechiae#), and musculoskeletal system (eg, subperiosteal/intramuscular hemarthrosis causing limp/arthralgias). $ Patients with scurvy frequently have anemia, which may be normocytic due to blood loss within tissues or microcytic due to associated poor iron intake or absorption.  However, #coagulation studies# (PT, PTT) are #normal# (although exposed endothelial collagen normally activates the intrinsic clotting cascade, the in vitro PTT test uses alternate activating substances [eg, kaolin] and is not affected by defective collagen). $ (Choice A)  Endothelial cell dysfunction in von Willebrand disease can lead to bleeding symptoms but would cause a prolonged PTT.  In addition, this patient's thin habitus, disorientation, and anemia make vitamin C deficiency more likely than an inherited bleeding disorder. $ (Choice B)  Deficiency in vitamin K, a fat-soluble vitamin, can lead to easy bruising and mucosal bleeding, but PT would be prolonged. $ (Choice C)  Defective clotting factor production in liver disease can lead to easy bleeding, but prolongation of PT (and sometimes PTT) is expected. $ (Choice D)  Platelet dysfunction in chronic kidney disease can cause easy bruising and mucosal bleeding with a normal platelet count and coagulation studies.  However, this patient's normal creatinine level is inconsistent with declining kidney function, and azotemia alone (eg, due to dehydration) is not associated with platelet dysfunction. $ (Choice F)  Zinc deficiency can present with an erosive dermatitis involving the perioral region, but gingival bleeding or easy bruising would be unexpected. $ Educational objective Deficiency of vitamin C, a water-soluble vitamin, results in impaired collagen production.  Manifestations include cutaneous findings of coiled hair and perifollicular keratosis, in addition to hemorrhagic complications such as gingival bleeding and easy bruising.

Clinical manifestations of multiple myeloma include impaired hematopoiesis leading to a normochromic, normocytic anemia and weakness; lytic bone lesions classically affecting the vertebral column and causing back pain and pathologic fractures; and hypercalcemia and AL amyloidosis, which contribute to renal dysfunction.  Severe amyloidosis can also cause cardiac and cutaneous findings. $ The classic laboratory abnormalities in multiple myeloma include erythrocyte rouleaux formation on peripheral blood smear and Bence-Jones proteins in the urine.  Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) is a more specific laboratory test used to determine if excessive monoclonal immunoglobulins are present in the serum.  An \"M peak\" on SPEP indicates the presence of such an immunoglobulin.

Vitamin B12 deficiency can also cause neurologic signs. $ (Choice C) CLL is a lymphocytic malignancy that may cause a normochromic, normocytic anemia, but immunoglobulin production is classically depressed, not increased, in CLL. $ (Choice D) Aplastic anemia would cause a uniform depression of all hematologic cell lines, including leukocytes and platelets. $ (Choice F) Hodgkin lymphoma is a B-cell malignancy characterized by the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells on lymph node histology.  There may be anemia of chronic disease in patients with this condition, but a monoclonal gammopathy would not be expected. $ (Choice G) Patients with hypothyroidism may be anemic due to associated iron deficiency or pernicious anemia.  However, monoclonal gammopathy would not be expected. $ Educational Objective The finding of a high peak in the gamma-globulin region on serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) usually represents an M protein consisting of an overproduced monoclonal immunoglobulin.

The trigger in this case was likely #primaquine# prescribed for malaria prophylaxis. $ Manifestations of G6PD deficiency typically begin within 2-5 days and often include pallor, #dark urine#, and #jaundice#.  Laboratory evaluation reveals signs of #erythrocyte lysis# such as elevated bilirubin, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, and low haptoglobin (protein that binds free heme).  The bone marrow responds by releasing young erythrocytes, leading to #reticulocytosis#.  Peripheral smear will demonstrate signs of denatured hemoglobin precipitation such as intraerythrocytic dark inclusions (@Heinz bodies@). $ G6PD deficiency is an #X-linked recessive# disorder; males (46,XY) who carry the mutation are affected because all erythrocytes have the defective G6PD gene.  Females (46,XX) who carry a copy of the defective gene (heterozygous) are usually unaffected because random inactivation of the X chromosome (lyonization) results in ~50% of erythrocytes with the normal gene.  However, heterozygous females can develop acute hemolysis when lyonization is @skewed@ toward expression of the mutated gene. $ (Choice A)  Most structural erythrocyte abnormalities (eg, hereditary spherocytosis) are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.

Mitochondrial diseases generally limit cellular ATP generation due to impaired oxidative phosphorylation and often present with neuromuscular dysfunction.  Heinz bodies would not be seen; in addition, hemolysis following medication exposure indicates likely G6PD deficiency. $ (Choice D)  X-linked dominant disorders affect males and females equally.  Nearly all cases of symptomatic G6PD deficiency occur in males, indicating an X-linked recessive inheritance pattern. $ Educational objective Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is an X-linked recessive disorder that causes acute hemolysis after exposure to oxidizing medications, foods, or acute infection.

Red blood cell fragments, burr cells and helmet cells are consistent with traumatic hemolysis, which can result from either microangiopathic hemolytic anemia or mechanical damage (e.g. prosthetic valve). $ Prosthetic valves produce excessive shear and turbulence in the cardiac circulation, causing mechanical trauma to the RBCs. $ Burr cells are erythrocytes with short, evenly-spaced projections.  They can occur as an artifact or in association with uremia, pyruvate kinase deficiency, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, or mechanical damage. $ (Choice A) Microvascular thrombi are the pathophysiologic mechanism for microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, which causes thrombocytopenia.  In this patient, platelet count is normal. $ (Choice B) Cytoskeleton abnormalities describe an intracorpuscular defect characteristic of a group of anemias that includes hereditary spherocytosis, hereditary elliptocytosis, and hereditary stomatocytosis.  Respectively, spherocytes, elliptocytes, or stomatocytes are characteristically seen in the peripheral blood smear.  $(Choice C) Impaired DNA synthesis is the pathophysiologic mechanism for megaloblastic anemia.

In addition, hypersegmented neutrophils are also characteristic. $ (Choice D) Gastrointestinal blood loss results in hypochromic, microcytic anemia due to iron deficiency. $ (Choice E) Mutation of the beta globin chain results in beta thalassemia; target cells are the RBC morphologic variant commonly seen. $ (Choice F) Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is an episodic hemolysis caused by a complement-mediated mechanism.  Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia (pancytopenia) are commonly associated. $ Educational Objective Red blood cell fragments, burr cells, and helmet cells are associated with either microangiopathic hemolytic anemia or mechanical red cell destruction.$ In patients with prosthetic valves, red blood cells are exposed to excessive shear and turbulence in the circulation, causing damage from mechanical trauma."

  "explanation_2": "$This patient with daytime sleepiness, recurrent headaches, and snoring most likely has #obstructive sleep apnea# (OSA).  Excess tissue around the extrathoracic upper airways (eg, from obesity) can predispose to upper airway collapse during sleeping.  As a result, patients with OSA may have up to 500 episodes of asphyxia per night. $ In adults, the main response to hypoxemia is coordinated by the #kidneys#.  In the renal cortex, peritubular fibroblasts sense hypoxia using the transcription factor #hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha# (HIF-1α).  When oxygen is readily available, @HIF-1α@ is marked for proteasomal degradation.  Under low oxygen conditions, intracellular levels of HIF-1α accumulate, substantially increasing erythropoietin (EPO) production. $ EPO is secreted into the bloodstream, acting on the bone marrow to accelerate @erythrocyte precursor@ maturation #(choice A)#.  The rapid rise in the number of mature erythrocytes leads to #secondary polycythemia# (eg, elevated hematocrit).  As a result, the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood rises, helping to compensate for chronic hypoxemia. $ (Choice B)  The brain does not regulate erythropoiesis in response to hypoxemia.  Instead, severe cerebral hypoxia drives increased sympathetic tone, increasing respiration, cerebral perfusion pressure, and oxygen delivery.  $(Choice C)  In response to hypoxemia, the liver helps supply iron (by suppressing hepcidin and upregulating transferrin) to support EPO-driven red blood cell production.  However, iron mobilization alone is insufficient to increase erythropoiesis.  For this reason, patients with severe @chronic kidney disease@ (low EPO production), even when chronically hypoxemic, often have anemia and fail to develop secondary polycythemia.  $(Choice D)  With OSA, the lungs do not receive adequate oxygen delivery due to recurrent upper airway collapse.  In response to chronic alveolar hypoxemia, HIF-1α activation in the lungs contributes to sustained pulmonary vasoconstriction and pulmonary hypertension.  However, the lungs do not participate in erythropoiesis. $ (Choice F)  The spleen is the major site of erythrocyte destruction, not production.  In states of chronic hypoxemia, severe anemia, or bone marrow dysfunction, tissues with resident hematopoietic stem cells (eg, spleen, liver) can respond by participating in erythropoiesis (ie, extramedullary hematopoiesis). $ Educational objective The kidneys respond to chronic hypoxemia (detected by the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha) by substantially increasing production of erythropoietin.  This hormone circulates to the bone marrow, where it accelerates the maturation of erythrocyte precursors, resulting in an elevated hematocrit (secondary polycythemia).",

Trousseau later diagnosed his own visceral cancer after developing the syndrome. $ Trousseau also described the Trousseau sign (hand/forearm muscle spasms on sphygmomanometric measurement) associated with hypocalcemia. $ (Choice A)  Celiac sprue has been associated with a hemorrhagic diathesis (rather than abnormal thrombosis).  The malabsorption resulting from celiac sprue can result in vitamin K deficiency. $ #(Choices B and D)#  Polycystic kidney disease is not among the conditions commonly associated with an acquired prothrombotic state.  Disseminated chlamydia infections are classically associated with reactive arthritis (not thrombophlebitis), and infections in general can create a systemic inflammatory state that favors thrombosis.  However, malignancy would be a more likely explanation for migratory superficial thrombophlebitis accompanied by vague abdominal pain. $ (Choice C)  Hyperthyroidism has been associated with a hypercoagulable state and is occasionally reported in cases of cerebral venous thrombosis, but there is no evidence of a significant association with venous thrombotic events.  $ Educational objective A paraneoplastic syndrome of hypercoagulability may be seen in some patients with cancer, especially adenocarcinomas of the pancreas, colon, or lung.  Superficial venous thromboses may therefore appear in one site and then resolve, only to recur in another site.

Thus, the most likely diagnosis is a mutation in the factor V gene, which renders factor Va resistant to inactivation by activated protein C.  A specific factor V mutation, known as the Leiden mutation, and mutations in the prothrombin gene are the most common inherited causes of hypercoagulability.  Activated protein C resistance (factor V Leiden mutation) is detected in approximately 20% (range 12–40%) of patients with abnormal venous thromboses. $ (Choice A) Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is a common immune cause of hypercoagulability.

Unlike the patient in the vignette, patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome typically have a prolonged baseline aPTT.  Lupus anticoagulants are the most common cause of aPTT prolongation. $ (Choice B) Folic acid deficiency can cause hyperhomocysteinemia, which is a prothrombotic state.  However, activated protein C resistance is not seen with this condition. $ (Choice D) Endovascular infections and/or systemic inflammatory states may affect vascular endothelial cells in a way that favors thrombosis.  However, infection and inflammatory mediators do not directly promote activated protein C resistance in the aPTT coagulation test. $ (Choice E) A paraneoplastic syndrome of hypercoagulability may be seen in some patients with cancer, especially patients with adenocarcinomas of the pancreas, colon, or lung.  The mechanism of cancer-induced hypercoagulability is thought to involve release of procoagulant tumor products.  Vascular stasis due to obstruction of blood flow by the tumor, patient immobility, hepatic involvement and dysfunction, sepsis, and advanced age may also contribute to the tendency toward thrombosis in cancer patients.  None of these mechanisms/factors directly promotes activated protein C resistance in the aPTT coagulation test. $ Educational Objective Inherited causes of hypercoagulability should be considered in patients younger than age 50 who present with thrombosis and no obvious explanation for an acquired prothrombotic state.

This patient with a large, anterior mediastinal mass and elevated #β-hCG# and #alpha fetoprotein# (AFP) levels most likely has a GCT. $ In adults, the anterior mediastinum is the most common location for extragonadal GCTs, which may be either benign (eg, benign teratoma) or malignant (eg, seminomas, nonseminomatous GCTs).  These occur predominantly in young men and can cause chest discomfort and compressive symptoms (eg, cough, dyspnea) due to mass effect on adjacent structures (eg, trachea).

  "explanation_2": "Lymphadenopathy can represent inflammatory changes within the lymph node (reactive hyperplasia) or malignant transformation.  Reactive hyperplasia is a broad term that encompasses all benign, reversible enlargement of the lymphoid tissue secondary to an antigenic stimulus.  The nodal response to antigenic stimuli is highly variable and can be classified as follicular hyperplasia, sinus hyperplasia, or diffuse hyperplasia.  Follicular hyperplasia occurs when the follicles increase in size and number, whereas sinus hyperplasia occurs when the sinuses enlarge and fill with histiocytes.  Diffuse hyperplasia is observed when the nodal architecture is diffusely effaced by sheets of lymphocytes, immunoblasts, and macrophages.  When malignant transformation occurs (as in lymphomas), the normal lymph node architecture is distorted or effaced by the proliferation of malignant lymphoid cells, often to a greater extent than that seen with reactive hyperplasia.  Malignancy-associated effacement of nodal architecture may be follicular or diffuse. $ Reactive lymphoid hyperplasia is polyclonal in that it consists of a proliferation of many different cell types within the lymph node.  For each type of lymphocyte responding to an antigenic stimulus, multiple genetically-distinct cells of that variety undergo limited monoclonal expansion, leading to an overall polyclonal response.  Malignant transformation, in contrast, is monoclonal in that it results from the unchecked proliferation of a single genetically unique cell from only one cell line. $ Evaluation for monoclonality of the lymphocyte population is important when lymphoma is suspected.  The clonality of a T-cell population is assessed by molecular methods, such as PCR, that examine the rearrangement of T-cell receptor (TCR) genes.  If a single allele for the V region of the T-cell receptor predominates in a lymphocytic population, monoclonal proliferation is suspected.  The same principle applies when assessing B-cell clonality.  Monoclonal rearrangement of the genes for immunoglobulin variable regions is suggestive of a B-cell lymphoma.  Of the choices given, monoclonal TCR gene rearrangement is most indicative of malignant processes, especially in the context of appropriate clinical features (i.e., weight loss, night sweats, fever, anorexia). $ #(Choices A, B, & C)#  Pleomorphism, increased mitoses, and nuclear changes are all commonly seen in the lymphocytes of a reactive hyperplastic lymph node.  These findings do not automatically classify the specimen as malignant. $ (Choice E)  An admixture of several lymphoid cell types in a lymph node is suggestive of a benign process.  A predominantly monomorphic cell population is indicative of malignancy and is characteristic of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.  Hodgkin’s lymphoma does demonstrate an admixture of several lymphoid cell types within the lymph nodes; however, this finding does not distinguish Hodgkin’s lymphoma from reactive hyperplasia.  Additionally, genetic analysis of Reed-Sternberg cells most often reveals monoclonal characteristics.  $Educational objective Benign lymph node enlargement in response to antigenic stimulation is associated with a polyclonal proliferation of lymphocytes.  A monoclonal lymphocytic proliferation is strong evidence of malignancy."

This increases iron accumulation in the body through the following 2 mechanisms: $ • #Enterocytes# respond by increasing apical expression of divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1), increasing iron absorption from the intestinal lumen $ • #Hepatocytes# respond by decreasing @hepcidin@ synthesis; low hepcidin levels result in increased ferroportin expression on the basolateral surface of enterocytes.  This allows increased iron secretion into the circulation, leading to iron overload $ When body iron levels exceed 20 g, patients typically develop the classic triad of #micronodular cirrhosis#, diabetes mellitus, and skin pigmentation (ie, \"bronze diabetes\").  These patients are at an increased risk for #hepatocellular carcinoma#, congestive heart failure, and testicular atrophy/hypogonadism. $ (Choice A)  Basal ganglia atrophy is a potential complication commonly seen in Wilson disease (ie, hepatolenticular degeneration).  $(Choice B)  Exocrine pancreatic function is usually preserved in patients with hemochromatosis.  Therefore, fat malabsorption and osteoporosis (due to decreased vitamin D) would not typically be seen.  $ (Choice C)  Iron deficiency anemia is a potential complication of blood loss, lack of dietary iron, or an inability to absorb iron (eg, celiac disease).  Hemochromatosis results in iron overload, not iron deficiency.  $ (Choice E)  Pulmonary emphysema is a potential complication of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. $ Educational objective HFE protein mutations are the most common cause of primary hemochromatosis.  Inactivation of the HFE protein results in decreased hepcidin synthesis by hepatocytes and increased DMT1 expression by enterocytes, leading to iron overload.  Patients with hemochromatosis are at an increased risk for liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.",

  "explanation_2": "$This patient with pancytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, and teardrop cells on peripheral blood smear likely has #primary myelofibrosis#, a hematopoietic stem cell malignancy associated with the clonal expansion of #megakaryocytes#.  Neoplastic megakaryocytes secrete the cytokine #transforming growth factor-beta#, which stimulates bone marrow fibroblasts to fill the medullary space with collagen.  Subsequent #bone marrow fibrosis# usually leads to the following: $ • #Extramedullary hematopoiesis# – Because the bone marrow is destroyed by fibrotic tissue, hematopoiesis occurs in secondary hematopoietic tissue such as the spleen and liver.  This typically results in #marked splenomegaly# and a palpable liver edge on examination. $ • #Cytopenias# – Extramedullary hematopoiesis is much less efficient than medullary hematopoiesis.  Therefore, patients often have deficits in 1 or more cell lines (eg, anemia, #pancytopenia#). $ • #Dacrocytes# on peripheral blood smear – The red cell membrane is damaged when squeezing out of the fibrotic bone marrow or passing through the enlarged spleen, which leads to the formation of teardrop-shaped red cells. $ The diagnosis of primary myelofibrosis requires bone marrow examination.  Bone marrow aspiration frequently results in a #dry tap# (no marrow) due to significant bone marrow fibrosis.  Therefore, bone marrow biopsy is usually required; the presence of a diffusely @fibrotic marrow@ with occasional clusters of atypical megakaryocytes confirms the diagnosis. $ (Choice B)  @Multiple myeloma@, a clonal disorder of plasma cells, is marked by a monoclonal spike (M-spike) on protein electrophoresis.  Patients typically have anemia, hypercalcemia, bone pain (osteolytic lesions), and renal insufficiency.  Bone marrow biopsy usually shows a clusters of monoclonal plasma cells. $ (Choice C)  Anemia of chronic disease is associated with hepcidin-induced changes in iron metabolism that cause iron trapping within macrophages.  Bone marrow biopsy with Prussian blue stain demonstrates increased iron within macrophages.  Hepatosplenomegaly and teardrop cells would be unexpected. $ (Choice D)  @Myelodysplastic syndrome@ is a malignant stem cell cancer associated with the production of dysplastic, atypical blood cells.  Although most patients with myelodysplasia have cytopenias, the bone marrow is usually hypercellular with multi-lineage dysplasia.  $(Choice E)  @Aplastic anemia@ results from injury (eg, drugs, radiation, viruses) to multipotent hematologic stem cells.  It is usually associated with pancytopenia and a profoundly hypocellular bone marrow predominantly composed of adipose tissue.  Extramedullary hematopoiesis is minimal and hepatosplenomegaly and dacrocytes are not typically present. $ Educational objective Primary myelofibrosis is a myeloproliferative disorder associated with the clonal expansion of megakaryocytes.  Bone marrow fibrosis accounts for most of the major manifestations, including hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenias, and blood smear evidence of dacrocytes.

They are formed by #mechanical trauma# to erythrocytes as they circulate through the vasculature.  This patient's schistocytes are most likely due to erythrocyte damage caused by his #aortic valve prosthesis#.  Artificial (mechanical) valves are more traumatic for RBCs than porcine prostheses and frequently cause hemolysis.  Schistocytes can also be formed from narrowing of the microvascular spaces, as seen in disseminated intravascular coagulation, hemolytic-uremic syndrome, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. $ #Hemolytic anemia# due to intravascular erythrocyte destruction results in laboratory findings similar to those in other types of hemolytic anemias, including an increase in serum indirect bilirubin.  Intravascular erythrocyte damage also results in free hemoglobin in serum (hemoglobinemia) and urine (hemoglobinuria) as well as increased serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).  Haptoglobin is a serum protein that binds to free hemoglobin and promotes its uptake by the reticuloendothelial system.  #Haptoglobin levels decrease# when significant quantities of hemoglobin are released into the circulation, as occurs with intravascular hemolysis. $ (Choice A)  Increased serum iron occurs in hemochromatosis most classically, but increased serum iron can also be iatrogenic.  Hemochromatosis does not cause anemia, but it is associated with cirrhosis and increased incidence of hepatocellular cancer.  Hemolysis does not usually have a significant effect on serum iron because the iron released from lysed RBCs remains bound to hemoglobin. $ (Choice C)  Increased mean corpuscular volume (MCV) occurs in @megaloblastic anemia@ (eg, folate/vitamin B12 deficiency) due to the presence of enlarged ovoid erythrocytes.  Increased MCV may also occur with other forms of anemia due to a reactive increase in reticulocytes (large, immature RBCs); however, anemia caused by mechanical erythrocyte trauma usually results in decreased MCV due to the presence of small RBC fragments (schistocytes). $ (Choice D)  A decreased reticulocyte count in the presence of anemia is characteristic of aplastic anemia.  In hemolytic anemias, the reticulocyte count is increased to compensate for the increased destruction of RBCs. $ (Choice E)  A decreased serum albumin level is associated with cirrhosis (decreased production), nephrotic syndrome (urinary loss), and protein-wasting enteropathy (bowel loss). $ Educational objective Schistocytes (helmet cells) are fragmented erythrocytes.  They occur secondary to mechanical trauma from microangiopathic hemolytic anemias or prosthetic cardiac valves (macroangiopathic).

Her laboratory results show a consumptive coagulopathy (thrombocytopenia, prolonged PT/PTT, low fibrinogen), which, along with bleeding from the central catheter site, are likely due to #disseminated intravascular coagulation# (DIC). $ DIC is a common complication of #sepsis# (particularly with gram-negative organisms) because #lipopolysaccharide# is a #procoagulant#that triggers the coagulation cascade.  This leads to the formation of fibrin- and platelet-rich thrombi in the vasculature, which consumes platelets #(thrombocytopenia)#, coagulation factors #(prolonged PT/PTT)#, and fibrinogen.  Fibrinolysis is then triggered to degrade the clots, which #elevates D-dimer# (a fibrin degradation product) and depletes protein C, protein S, and antithrombin.  The thrombi also often shear red blood cells, leading to #microangiopathic hemolytic anemia# (MAHA). $ Most patients with acute DIC have signs of bleeding, such as #oozing from vascular catheters#, mucocutaneous bleeding, ecchymosis, or petechiae.  End organ damage (eg, renal insufficiency, pulmonary hemorrhage) is also common. $ (Choice A)  Anticardiolipin antibody is antiphospholipid antibody often seen in patients with lupus erythematosus.  It can cause antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, which is marked by thromboembolism and fetal loss (not bleeding).  Although patients often have prolonged PTT (because the antiphospholipid interferes with the PTT test), PT is normal. $ (Choice B)  Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is caused by reduced activity of von Willebrand factor–cleaving protein ADAMTS13, leading to the accumulation of ultra-large von Willebrand factor multimers that trap platelets and generate platelet-rich thrombi in the microvasculature.  Although patients usually develop thrombocytopenia, MAHA, fever, confusion, and organ damage (eg, acute renal failure), the coagulation cascade is unaffected; therefore, PT/PTT and fibrinolysis (fibrinogen level) are normal, and bleeding does not occur. $ (Choice D)  Immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is marked by autoantibodies to platelets/megakaryocytes; thrombocytopenia is the only peripheral blood abnormality.  Coagulation studies (eg, PT, PTT) and fibrinogen levels are normal.  Spontaneous bleeding is very uncommon unless the platelet count is <10,000/mm3. $ (Choice E)  The liver generates thrombopoietin and the majority of clotting factors.  Therefore, patients with significantly impaired hepatic function (eg, cirrhosis) sometimes have mild thrombocytopenia and prolonged coagulation studies.  However, fibrinogen level is usually normal and this patient has no other signs of advanced hepatic dysfunction (eg, ascites, jaundice). $ Educational objective Disseminated intravascular coagulation commonly occurs in the setting of sepsis and is characterized by widespread activation of the coagulation cascade with formation of microthrombi.  Laboratory results reveal prolonged PT/PTT, thrombocytopenia, and low fibrinogen (ie, a consumptive coagulopathy), and patients usually have signs of bleeding (eg, oozing from venipuncture sites)."

  "explanation_2": "#Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)#, type M3 of acute myelogenous leukemia in the French-American-British classification system, results from a #t(15;17) mutation# whereby the gene for retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARα) is transferred from chromosome 17 to chromosome 15, where it fuses with the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene.  This leads to the formation of a new gene called #PML/RARα#.  Normally, RARα plays a role in the proper differentiation of myeloid precursors, as the receptor interacts with retinoic acid to affect transcription of genes required for maturation.  However, the t(15;17) mutation in APML causes transcription repression and produces an #abnormal receptor# that is unable to signal for the differentiation of myeloid precursors at physiologic doses of retinoic acid. $ Treatment with #all-trans-retinoic acid# (ATRA), a vitamin A derivative, overcomes this (partly by inducing PML/RARα proteolysis) and stimulates differentiation of myeloblasts into mature granulocytes.  ATRA therapy induces remission in about 90% of patients with APL.  APL is associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation. $ (Choice A)  Acute lymphocytic leukemia predominantly affects children.  Blast cells positive for the CD10 antigen (CALLA) suggest a good prognosis. $(Choice C)  Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is frequently seen in elderly patients.  It presents with lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and anemia, and has an indolent course.  Neoplastic cells resemble mature B lymphocytes. $ (Choice D)  In chronic myeloid leukemia (also commonly manifesting in elderly patients with fatigue, leukocytosis, and splenomegaly), myeloid precursors in different stages of differentiation proliferate.  This disease is caused by a t(9;22) translocation that forms the BCR-ABL fusion gene, which codes for an abnormal tyrosine kinase. $ (Choice E)  Several high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphomas are associated with cytogenetic abnormalities.  t(8;14), t(2;8), and t(8;22) are typical for Burkitt lymphoma; these translocations involve the c-myc oncogene.  Burkitt lymphoma is associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection and classically has a \"starry sky\"A histologic appearance. $ Educational objective Acute promyelocytic leukemia is the M3 variant of acute myelogenous leukemia.  It affects adult patients and may present with disseminated intravascular coagulation.  The cytogenetic abnormality t(15;17) leads to formation of the promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha (PML/RARα) fusion gene, which is unable to signal for proper cellular differentiation, unlike the normal retinoic acid receptor."

The main pulmonary artery, usually comparable in diameter to the ascending aorta, is significantly dilated due to the proximal increase in hydrostatic pressure from the PE.  Saddle PE can result in sudden cardiac death or severe hypotension, but many patients can be hemodynamically stable on presentation. $ Venous thromboembolism (VTE) (ie, PE or deep venous thrombosis) results from the @Virchow triad@ of endothelial injury, venous stasis, and a #hypercoagulable# state.  #Malignancy# (eg, prostate cancer) induces a hypercoagulable state and is a strong risk factor for VTE.  Active #smoking# is also a risk factor as it contributes to endothelial injury and a hypercoagulable state.

On physical examination, patients may have #blue \"lead lines\"# at the junction of the teeth and gingivae. $ The classic findings on peripheral blood smear are coarse basophilic stippling and hypochromic, microcytic anemia.  #Basophilic stippling# results from impaired degradation of ribosomal RNA, which is normally degraded and eliminated during reticulocyte maturation.  Lead inhibits an enzyme involved in this process, resulting in ribosomal precipitates that appear as dark blue-purple granules throughout red blood cells (RBCs).  #Hypochromic microcytic anemia# results from inhibition of delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase (delta-ALA dehydratase) and ferrochelatase, which are involved in @heme synthesis@.  This causes decreased hemoglobin synthesis, which gives the RBCs a pale appearance.  $(Choice A)  Acute intermittent porphyria is characterized by reduced activity of porphobilinogen deaminase (an enzyme in the heme synthesis pathway) in the liver, causing buildup of neurotoxic heme pathway intermediates.

The presence of a normal MCV makes vitamin B12 or folate deficiency unlikely because these are associated with macrocytic (not normocytic) anemia #(choice E)#.  Hypersplenism is also unlikely because abdominal examination would show significant splenomegaly #(choice C)#.  Chronic myelogenous leukemia, an infiltrative cancer associated with constitutively active tyrosine kinase, is also unlikely because this condition is usually associated with dramatic leukocytosis (not leukopenia) #(choice B)#. $ Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's pancytopenia is #aplastic anemia# (AA).  Although AA is linked to certain medications, infections, toxins, or radiation, most cases are #idiopathic# and thought to be caused by #autoimmune-induced loss of multipotent hematologic stem cells#.  In idiopathic AA, an underlying insult (eg, mutation, virus) causes alteration of surface antigens on multipotent stem cells, making them appear foreign and triggering a #cytotoxic T-cell response#.  Cytokines released by T-helper cells (type 1 cytokines) also contribute to the pathogenesis, most notably #interferon-gamma#, which triggers #apoptotic cell death# due to the stimulation of a destructive cytokine cascade and the increased expression of the Fas receptor on the hematologic stem cell surface. $ (Choice D)  Autoantibodies against glycoprotein IIb/IIIa cause immune thrombocytopenia, which is marked by thrombocytopenia and no change in the other cell lines. $ Educational objective Aplastic anemia is a form of bone marrow failure in which patients have decreased production of all cell lines (platelets, erythrocytes, and leukocytes).  It is primarily caused by the autoimmune destruction of multipotent hematologic stem cells due to an alteration in their surface antigens, leading to a cytotoxic T-cell response and release of interferon-gamma from T-helper cells (triggers apoptotic cell death)."

Once deposited in cells, iron binds to apoferritin to form ferritin micelles.  Because iron is used poorly in patients with thalassemia and cannot be excreted actively, the ferritin micelles accumulate in macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system.  The resulting @iron-storage complex@ is known as #hemosiderin# and microscopically appears as #brown or yellow-brown pigments# in either granular or crystalline form.  Hemosiderin can be confirmed histologically with Prussian-blue staining.  In the liver, hemosiderin is typically seen in #Kupffer cells# (hepatic macrophages that line the walls of the sinusoids and participate in RBC breakdown). $ Eventually, the iron burden will overwhelm the reticuloendothelial cells' capacity to sequester iron, resulting in parenchymal iron overload in the liver, myocardium, skin, and pancreas (eg, \"bronze diabetes\").

Heterozygote carriers of factor V Leiden have five to ten times the risk of developing a thrombosis, while homozygote carriers of factor V Leiden have fifty to one hundred times the risk of developing a thrombosis. $ Factor V Leiden causes thrombophilia through two pathophysiological mechanisms.  In normal hemostasis, activated protein C (APC) restricts clot formation by proteolytically inactivating factors Va and VIIIa.  Factor Va Leiden has reduced susceptibility to cleavage by APC, however.  Because factor Va is a cofactor in the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, persistently circulating factor Va Leiden results in increased thrombin production.  Additionally, factor V Leiden is unable to support APC anticoagulant activity.  This combination of increased coagulation and decreased anticoagulation produces the hypercoagulable state seen in those with factor V Leiden. $ (Choice A) Petechiae and ecchymoses are more consistent with qualitative or quantitative platelet abnormalities than factor V Leiden. $ (Choice B) Recurrent hemarthroses are suggestive of hemophilia (factor VIII or IX deficiency), not factor V Leiden. $ (Choice C) Renal artery stenosis is primarily caused by atherosclerosis and fibromuscular disease, not thrombosis.

VaD is often caused by 2 (potentially overlapping) mechanisms: $ • @Large artery infarction@ (often causing an overt stroke) produces a #cortical-type VaD#, in which accompanying neurologic signs/symptoms reflect the specific cortical region involved (eg, middle cerebral artery infarction causing contralateral weakness and sensory impairment). $ • #Small artery# (ie, arteriole) infarcts can combine to cause enough cumulative damage to the brain, resulting in noticeable cognitive deficits.  Although the clinical picture is varied, a subcortical-type VaD is common because there is less arteriole collateralization in the subcortical regions compared to the cerebral cortex.  As in this patient, #subcortical-type VaD# is often accompanied by focal motor deficits (eg, reflex asymmetry, strength differences), abnormal gait, urinary symptoms, and psychiatric symptoms (eg, depressive syndromes). $ Subcortical VaD is due to either cerebral amyloid angiopathy or, more commonly, #small vessel arteriolosclerosis#.  Arteriolosclerosis is common in older patients, especially those with a history of hypertension. $ (Choice B)  Degeneration of the cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain is seen in Alzheimer disease, which presents with progressive memory loss and functional impairments.  However, Alzheimer disease typically progresses gradually with early, prominent short-term memory loss, and it would not cause focal neurologic findings (eg, strength deficits, reflex asymmetry). $ (Choice C)  Degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra is characteristic of Parkinson disease, which can cause executive and visuospatial dysfunction with relatively mild memory impairment.  However, Parkinsonian features (eg, rigidity, resting tremor, bradykinesia) occur at least a year before the onset of dementia. $ (Choice D)  Sudden acceleration-deceleration or rotational forces during blunt head injury can cause diffuse shearing of the long white matter tracts (diffuse axonal injury).  Patients have a history of acute trauma and neurologic impairment out of proportion to neuroimaging findings. $ (Choice E)  Neuronal loss and atrophy of hypothalamic mamillary bodies characteristically occurs in Wernicke encephalopathy, a complication of thiamine deficiency.  Although it can cause ataxia and confusion, it also typically presents with oculomotor dysfunction (nystagmus, ophthalmoplegia), and patients typically have a history of either chronic alcohol use or malnutrition. $ Educational objective Small artery cerebral arteriolosclerosis can lead to ischemia that predominantly affects the subcortical areas.  This can lead to vascular dementia associated with focal motor deficits, abnormal gait, urinary symptoms, and psychiatric symptoms.",

  "explanation_2": "$The #amyloid precursor protein# (APP) gene (located on #chromosome 21#) encodes a transmembrane protein that is normally involved in synaptic formation and repair.  APP is processed in 1 of 2 pathways by a series of secretases (proteolytic enzymes): processing via the alpha- and gamma-secretase pathway, which does not result in amyloidogenic proteins, or processing via the beta- and gamma-secretase pathway, which results in the production of #beta amyloid#. $ If beta amyloid is not sufficiently cleared by cellular processes, it can form #insoluble fibrils# and contribute to the generation of extracellular @amyloid plaques@ that accumulate in the @brain@.  These aggregates of beta amyloid are neurotoxic and associated with the development and progression of Alzheimer dementia, a disease characterized by #accelerated neurodegeneration# leading to progressive cognitive dysfunction.  As a result, patients who have abnormal APP processing, impaired beta-amyloid clearance, or production of higher levels of APP (eg, #trisomy 21# [Down syndrome]) are at increased risk of developing #Alzheimer dementia#. $ (Choice A)  Patients with trisomy 21 have an increased risk of hematologic malignancies such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia.  This is thought to be related to the high susceptibility of megakaryocytic and B-cell precursors to increased dosage of chromosome 21 genes. $ (Choice C)  Erythrocyte membrane distortion most often occurs with abnormalities affecting either the cytoskeleton (eg, spectrin/ankyrin in hereditary spherocytosis) or hemoglobin (eg, beta globin in sickle cell disease). $ (Choice D)  Pulmonary elastic tissue loss can occur when there is excessive alveolar elastin degradation (eg, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency).  Alpha-1 antitrypsin is a serine protease inhibitor that is synthesized in the liver and released into the systemic circulation. $ (Choice E)  Skeletal myofiber disruption (eg, muscular & myotonic dystrophy) can occur with numerous mutations affecting the internal cytoskeletal system and contractile components (eg, sarcomere, costamere proteins).  However, it is not typically related to impaired proteolytic cleavage and does not result in precipitation of insoluble fibrils. $ Educational objective The amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene is located on chromosome 21 and encodes a cell-surface protein that can be degraded into beta amyloid.  Abnormal APP processing, impaired beta-amyloid clearance, and production of higher levels of APP are associated with the increased formation of the neurotoxic plaques that characterize Alzheimer dementia.",

TB meningitis arises when circulating bacilli lodge in the subependymal or subpial space, forming a tubercle that subsequently ruptures into the subarachnoid space.  Common findings include the following: $ • A #thick, gelatinous exudate# most prominent in the #basal portion of the brain#.  This exudate can encase the cranial nerves, leading to cranial nerve palsy, and invade the circle of Willis, leading to stroke. $ • Tuberculous #vasculitis# of the cerebral arteries.  This can cause #multiple bilateral brain infarctions#, particularly in the periventricular cerebral areas. $ • #Hydrocephalus# due to obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid outflow by tubercular proteins.

Carditis can also occur, which can result in degeneration of the cardiac conduction system.  However, this patient's combination of UMN and LMN signs is much more likely to be ALS. $ (Choice D)  ALS is a disease that primarily affects motor neurons (both upper and lower).  Although sensory disturbances can be present in some patients, widespread sensory defects do not occur. $ (Choice E)  Tuberous sclerosis is an autosomal dominant disorder that results in tumors in multiple organ systems.  Generalized tonic-clonic seizures often occur and become refractory as the disease progresses.  This patient has no evidence of tumors or seizures nor a positive family history to suggest tuberous sclerosis. $ Educational objective Patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis often develop respiratory failure due to inspiratory muscle weakness (causing decreased vital capacity), expiratory muscle weakness (causing a weak cough), and bulbar dysfunction (causing dysphagia and chronic aspiration)."

Bacterial meningitis classically causes the triad of fever, neck stiffness, and altered mental state.  The presence of temporal lobe swelling on brain imaging makes HSV encephalitis far more likely than bacterial meningitis. $ (Choice D)  Tuberculous or fungal meningitis is often associated with CSF evidence of low glucose, moderately elevated protein, and lymphocytic pleocytosis.  Most patients with herpes encephalitis have normal CSF glucose and elevated CSF erythrocytes.  In addition, the presence of temporal lobe swelling makes HSV encephalitis more likely than tuberculous or fungal meningitis. $ (Choice E)  Patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) often have CSF protein elevations with normal cell counts (albuminocytologic dissociation), which is thought to be due to increased permeability of the blood-nerve-barrier at the level of the nerve root.  GBS usually presents with progressive, symmetric ascending muscle weakness, not seizures and fevers. $ Educational objective Viral infections of the central nervous system are usually characterized by an elevated white blood cell count with a lymphocytic predominance, normal glucose, and elevated (or normal) protein.  Patients with herpes encephalitis also usually have elevated erythrocytes in the cerebrospinal fluid due to hemorrhagic inflammation of the temporal lobes.

The syrinx is most commonly situated at the C8-T1 cord levels and may extend rostrally, caudally, and centrifugally.  Further expansion within the cervical cord in later stages of the disease can produce lower extremity weakness and hyperreflexia (an upper motor neuron defect) by affecting the lateral corticospinal tract and can also lead to loss of position and vibration senses in the feet due to involvement of the posterior columns.  Scoliosis can occur due to paresis of paravertebral muscles. $ (Choice A)  Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a progressive degenerative disease of upper and lower motor neurons only; it does not cause sensory loss. $ (Choice B)  Guillain-Barré syndrome is a peripheral nervous system autoimmune demyelinating polyneuropathy that typically causes lower motor neuron manifestations (eg, areflexia, weakness) in a symmetric ascending pattern. $ (Choice C)  Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant central nervous system (CNS) tumor in children, with pilocytic astrocytoma, a low-grade astrocytoma, being the most common CNS tumor overall.  Medulloblastoma is a posterior fossa tumor that causes symptoms related to obstructive hydrocephalus. $ (Choice D)  Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune CNS demyelinating disorder that presents with episodic neurologic symptoms reflecting defects in various white matter tracts. $ (Choice E)  Normal pressure hydrocephalus is characterized by gait ataxia and urinary incontinence.  It is rare in patients age <60.  Defective cerebrospinal fluid resorption by the arachnoid granulations gives rise to the secondary form of this disease. $ Educational objective The combination of fixed segmental loss of upper extremity pain and temperature sensations, upper extremity lower motor neuron signs, and/or lower extremity upper motor neuron signs in the setting of scoliosis suggests syringomyelia."

  "explanation_2": "$Neuropathy is a common chronic complication of diabetes mellitus.  The clinical features of diabetic neuropathy vary considerably depending on the pattern of nerve involvement, which can be broadly divided into polyneuropathy, mononeuropathy, and autonomic neuropathy.  Mononeuropathies can also be further subdivided into cranial and peripheral types. $ All ocular motor nerves (III, IV, VI) can be affected in diabetes but unilateral cranial nerve III (CN III) involvement is most common.  #Diabetic CN III mononeuropathy# classically presents with #acute onset diplopia#.  On examination, the affected eye assumes a #\"down and out\" position# due to the unopposed pull by the superior oblique (CN IV) and lateral rectus (CN VI) muscles because all other extraocular muscles (inferior oblique and superior, inferior, and medial recti) are supplied by CN III.  #Ptosis# also occurs due to paralysis of the levator palpebrae. $ Diabetic mononeuropathy is caused by ischemic nerve damage, which predominantly involves the core of the CN III with relative sparing of the peripheral part.  The somatic component of CN III that innervates the extraocular muscles is located centrally, but the autonomic component responsible for pupillary constriction and accommodation is located in the peripheral aspect of the nerve.  Therefore, #pupillary size and reactivity is normal# in diabetic CN III mononeuropathy. $ (Choice A)  CN III neuropathy can also occur due to nerve compression.  Causes include transtentorial (uncal) herniation, neoplasms, and aneurysms of the posterior cerebral and posterior communicating arteries.  In contrast to diabetic CN III mononeuropathy, pupillary dysfunction is often an early manifestation of external nerve compression due to injury of the peripherally located parasympathetic fibers. $ #(Choices B and E)#  Neither nerve inflammation nor muscle infiltration contributes to the development of diabetic neuropathy. $ (Choice D)  Lacunar midbrain strokes can involve the CN III nuclei.  Because many neurologic pathways are densely packed in this area, CN III nuclei impairment is almost always associated with other neurologic deficits (eg, cerebellar ataxia, hemiparesis, or contralateral extrapyramidal symptoms).  In addition, the contralateral superior rectus is affected because the subnucleus fibers decussate to the contralateral side.  Midbrain lesions also cause bilateral ptosis because both levator palpebrae are innervated by a single subnucleus. $ Educational objective Diabetic mononeuropathy often involves cranial nerve III.  It is caused by predominantly central ischemia, which affects the somatic nerve fibers but spares peripheral parasympathetic fibers.  Symptoms include ptosis, a 'down and out' gaze, and normal light and accommodation reflexes."

Upper extremity involvement (ie, intrinsic musculature of the hands) typically occurs later in the disease course. $ (Choice A)  Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy are X-linked inherited disorders caused by abnormalities in muscle dystrophin.  Patients also develop distal limb weakness but present with a waddling gait and pseudohypertrophy (rather than atrophy) of the calf muscles. $ (Choice C)  Malignant hyperthermia occurs in patients with abnormal ryanodine receptors, which allow excessive calcium accumulation within the skeletal muscle when exposed to volatile anesthetics (eg, halothane, isoflurane).  This results in sustained muscle contraction, leading to muscle rigidity, hyperthermia, hypercarbia, and rhabdomyolysis. $ (Choice D)  Botulinum toxin cleaves SNARE proteins within neurons, preventing the synaptic vesicle from fusing to the cell membrane and releasing neurotransmitters.

The resultant injuries are due to infants' unique anatomic features.  Infants have larger heads, enlarged subarachnoid spaces, higher brain water content, and decreased cervical muscle tone compared to older children.  These factors lead to increased movement of the immature brain in relation to the skull, shearing the #bridging cortical veins# that run between the dura and arachnoid mater (subdural space).

Vertigo resulting from vestibular dysfunction tends to be of sudden onset, interfere with walking, and cause nausea and vomiting.  Typical causes of vestibulopathy include Meniere's disease, perilymphatic fistulas, benign positional vertigo, labyrinthitis, and acoustic neuromas. $ (Choice A)  Disease of the posterior column of the spinal cord can occur in syphilis (i.e., tabes dorsalis) and vitamin B12 deficiency.  Typical symptoms include ataxia, decreased proprioception and vibratory sense, and hyporeflexia.  This patient's normal neurologic exam makes posterior column disease unlikely. $ (Choice B)  Vagal nerve damage can present as hoarseness, dysphagia, abnormal gastrointestinal motility, or tachycardia.  Vagal nerve dysfunction will not cause vertigo. $ (Choice C)  Optic tract dysfunction will result in visual problems.  Vision deficits do not typically cause vertigo, but may cause people to feel unsteady on their feet. $ (Choice E)  Cerebellar dysfunction presents as ataxia, imbalance, incoordination, and nystagmus.  Patients with cerebellar dysfunction will be unable to perform tandem walking due to their imbalance. $ (Choice F)  The frontal cortex controls executive functions and response inhibition.  Damage to the frontal cortex results in \"frontal release\" symptoms, such as personality change, inability to organize or plan, and disinhibition. $ Educational Objective Vertigo is a sensation of excessive motion compared to physical reality.  It is most commonly due to dysfunction within the vestibular system."

A common initial manifestation of MS is #optic neuritis#, characterized by monocular visual loss with pain on eye movement and an afferent pupillary defect.  MRI findings in MS typically include white matter lesions scattered throughout the brain and/or spinal cord with a predilection for the subcortical @periventricular regions@. $ The pathogenesis of MS involves an autoimmune response targeting oligodendrocytes, the myelin-producing cells of the CNS.  Helper T cells abnormally react to antigens in myelin, causing a release of inflammatory cytokines (eg, interferon-gamma) that promote the infiltration of destructive macrophages/microglia and leukocytes.  B cells also play a role as most patients with MS have oligoclonal immunoglobulin bands in the cerebrospinal fluid.  Myelin degeneration leads to slowed nerve conduction with neurologic deficits as described above. $ (Choice A)  Astrocytes are glial cells (non-neural cells) that contribute to the blood-brain barrier and play an important role in potassium buffering, neurotransmitter metabolism, and glial scar formation.  Astrocytes proliferate and form the scar (gliosis) after the attack on oligodendrocytes; astrocytes are usually not targeted by the immunologic response in MS. $ (Choice B)  Ependymal cells are ciliated glial cells that line the ventricles of the brain and the central canal of the spinal cord.

Migraines typically last 4-72 hours and have a strong genetic predisposition; #women# are affected more frequently than men. $ Migraines are thought to be triggered by a self-propagating wave of depolarization spreading across neurons in the cerebral cortex, resulting in activation and sensitization of trigeminal nerve nociceptors.

Most cases occur in those with advanced HIV who have CD4 counts <200/mm3.

Activation of these cells occurs in response to the infection, inflammatory cytokines, and HIV-derived proteins, which leads them to cluster around small areas of necrosis (forming #microglial nodules#) and fuse together to form #multinucleated giant cells#.  Because HIV does not directly infect neurons, the underlying pathology of HIV-associated dementia is thought to stem from the #release of neurotoxic compounds# by these activated monocytes. $ #(Choices A and B)#  Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is marked by beta-amyloid deposits in the walls of cortical blood vessels.

The small size of the fossa causes parts of the #cerebellum# and medulla to #herniate through# the #foramen magnum#.  There are 2 types of Chiari malformations.  @Chiari type I@ is the most common and benign, and is characterized by low-lying cerebellar tonsils that extend below the foramen magnum into the vertebral canal.  Patients typically present during adolescence/adulthood with paroxysmal occipital headaches (due to meningeal irritation) and cerebellar dysfunction (eg, dizziness, ataxia) due to compression of the cerebellar tonsils. $ @Chiari type II@, Arnold-Chiari malformation, is more severe and typically becomes evident during the neonatal period.  It is characterized by downward displacement of the cerebellum (vermis, tonsils) and medulla through the foramen magnum.  Non-communicating hydrocephalus almost always occurs due to aqueductal stenosis.  Compression of the medulla may result in dysphagia, stridor, and apnea.  Patients also often have an associated lumbar myelomeningocele, which can cause lower limb paralysis. $ (Choice A)  Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system that typically presents in young adult women with neurologic deficits disseminated in space and time.  Neuroimaging typically shows periventricular white matter lesions. $ (Choice C)  Friedreich ataxia is an autosomal recessive trinucleotide repeat disorder that presents during childhood with ataxia, loss of vibration/proprioception sense, and skeletal abnormalities (eg, kyphoscoliosis, pes cavus). $ (Choice D)  Cerebellar neoplasms (eg, medulloblastoma, pilocytic astrocytoma) often present in children with symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (eg, headache, vomiting) and cerebellar dysfunction.  However, the absence of a cerebellar tumor on neuroimaging makes this unlikely. $ (Choice E)  Traumatic brain injury can cause headache and neurologic impairment; however, this patient's MRI findings are highly characteristic of Chiari type I malformation. $ (Choice F)  Cerebellar stroke may present with acute-onset occipital headache, dizziness, and ataxia.  However, this patient's young age, absence of cardiovascular risk factors, and long history of episodic symptoms make this less likely. $ Educational objective Chiari malformations are congenital disorders that result from underdevelopment of the posterior fossa, causing parts of the cerebellum and medulla to herniate through the foramen magnum.  Chiari type I is relatively benign and presents during adulthood with occipital headache and cerebellar dysfunction.  Chiari type II is a more severe form that affects neonates and is often associated with lumbar myelomeningocele and hydrocephalus.",

Transfer of force can result in immediate #shearing of the white matter tracts# or induce secondary biochemical changes leading to degradation of the axonal cytoskeleton with subsequent axon breakage.  Normal axonal transport is inhibited, leading to accumulation of axonally transported proteins (eg, #amyloid precursor, alpha-synuclein#) within axonal swellings at the point of injury (eg, axonal bulb formation). $ Presentation varies based on the extent of injury; most patients are #comatose# (Glasgow Coma Score <8); however, those with very mild DAI may have only concussive symptoms (eg, headache, amnesia).  CT scan has low sensitivity for diagnosis and is often normal, but MRI may demonstrate lesions at the gray-white junction.  Microscopically, DAI is visible as #widespread axonal swelling#, most pronounced at the #gray-white matter junction#.  Prognosis is poor, with up to 25% of cases resulting in death. $ #(Choices A and C)#  Diffuse cerebral hypoperfusion typically occurs in the setting of systemic hypotension or cardiac arrest.  Watershed zone infarctions or diffuse edema with blurring of the gray-white junction are often visible on imaging.  Ischemic neurons can release glutamate, leading to overactivation of the NMDA receptor with continuous membrane depolarization.  This results in neuronal damage in a process known as excitotoxicity.  Red neurons with intensely eosinophilic cytoplasm are seen on histopathology. $ (Choice B)  Disruption of the bridging cortical veins results in subdural hematoma; the elderly are at increased risk due to cerebral atrophy (stretching of the bridging veins increases the risk of tear).  Subdural hematomas are visible on imaging as crescent-shaped hyperdensities that cross suture lines. $ (Choice E)  Subarachnoid hemorrhages are typically caused by rupture of saccular aneurysms but may be associated with trauma (typically with associated brain contusions); head CT scan demonstrates blood within the subarachnoid space. $ Educational objective Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) is a type of traumatic brain injury that results from disruption of the white matter tracts.

  "explanation_2": "Demyelination of peripheral nerves in response to immune challenge with a myelin-like substance is a pathogenic mechanism similar to #Guillain-Barré syndrome# (GBS).  GBS is thought to be due to #molecular mimicry#, in which an infectious agent contains a ganglioside-like substance in its lipopolysaccharide layer.  Antibodies formed against this substance and activated T-cells cross-react with the ganglioside components of myelin and Schwann cells.  #Segmental demyelination# and an #endoneurial inflammatory infiltrate# composed of lymphocytes and macrophages are seen on light microscopy. $ GBS manifests as #ascending, symmetric muscle weakness# that often occurs after a gastrointestinal (eg, Campylobacter jejuni) or upper respiratory infection.  Deep tendon reflexes are decreased or absent (areflexia), and the paralysis may ascend to the cranial nerves (particularly cranial nerve VII).  Paralysis of respiratory muscles is fatal without supportive care. $ (Choice A)  Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an X-linked muscular dystrophy that affects boys and is caused by a frameshift mutation of the dystrophin gene.  Clinical features include progressive weakness and a waddling gait with onset in childhood.  Muscle biopsy shows degeneration of muscle fibers and replacement with fat and connective tissue; peripheral nerves are not involved. $ (Choice C)  Lambert-Eaton syndrome, often seen as a paraneoplastic syndrome in patients with small cell carcinoma of the lung, presents with weakness that improves with muscular repetition.  It is caused by autoantibodies that react with the voltage-gated calcium channels on the presynaptic membrane, hampering the release of acetylcholine.  The axons are not affected. $ (Choice D)  Beriberi (thiamine deficiency) is characterized by weakness, areflexia, pain, and paresthesias that are worse in the distal lower limbs.  Beriberi can cause demyelination of peripheral nerves; however, unlike Guillain-Barré syndrome, no endoneurial inflammation is present. $ (Choice E)  Subacute combined degeneration occurs due to vitamin B12 deficiency and leads to degeneration of dorsal columns and lateral cerebrospinal tracts.  Patients develop distal, progressive weakness and ataxia but the symptoms are slowly progressive (unlike GBS, which progresses rapidly).  In addition, subacute combined degeneration is associated with spasticity, paresthesia, and a macrocytic anemia. $ (Choice F)  Werdnig-Hoffman syndrome (spinal muscle atrophy type 1) is due to degeneration of the anterior horn cells that is caused by a mutation in the SMN1 gene.  Werdnig-Hoffman syndrome causes symmetric progressive weakness, but the weakness is more prominent proximal>distal and typically occurs in childhood. $Educational objective Guillain-Barré syndrome is an acute, demyelinating polyneuropathy thought to be caused by molecular mimicry.  Antibodies formed against infectious agents cross-react with myelin and Schwann cells, leading to immune-mediated demyelination.

Schwannomas that arise from cranial nerves (eg, CN VIII, @acoustic neuromas@) can cause hydrocephalus from mass effect due to their central location but would not be associated with an intraventricular mass. $ (Choice G)  @Hemangioblastomas@ originate from vascular endothelial cells in the cerebellum or spinal cord.  They characteristically appear as an enhancing nodule with a cystic component.  These tumors often bleed, which can cause hydrocephalus due to dysfunction in cerebrospinal reabsorption at the arachnoid villi, but they do not originate from the ventricular wall. $ Educational objective Ependymomas originate from the ependymal cells that line the ventricular system and the central canal of the spinal cord.  Ventricular ependymomas can block the flow of cerebrospinal fluid through the interventricular foramina, causing signs of increased intracranial pressure (eg, headache, papilledema) due to obstructive (noncommunicating) hydrocephalus.",

  "explanation_2": "This patient with long-standing diabetes has numbness and tingling in her feet and reduced ankle reflexes bilaterally.  This presentation suggests #diabetic neuropathy#, a common complication of diabetes mellitus that is associated with poor glycemic control and/or long disease duration.  It often manifests as a length-dependent #peripheral polyneuropathy# that primarily affects sensory axons; patients typically develop a #stocking-and-glove pattern# of pain or paresthesia.  Diminished pain sensation coupled with poor wound healing predisposes diabetic patients to develop #nonhealing wounds#. $ Neuronal injury in diabetes mellitus is multifactorial but largely occurs through the following mechanisms: $ • Nonenzymatic glycosylation of tissue proteins (eg, nerve, vasa nervorum) results in #hyalinization of endoneurial arterioles#, leading to narrowing of the arteriole lumens and #ischemic nerve damage#.  Additionally, glycosylation end-products are directly toxic to nerve tissue. $ • Intracellular hyperglycemia occurs in peripheral nerves and results in increased metabolism of glucose into sorbitol by aldose reductase.  Sorbitol accumulation increases cell osmolality, facilitates water influx into the cell, and #promotes oxidative stress# within the nerve. $ (Choice B)  Endoneurial inflammatory infiltration of the peripheral nerves is characteristic of Guillain-Barré syndrome, which typically causes a rapidly progressive ascending paralysis rather than a slowly progressive paresthesia.  Segmental demyelination is another typical pathologic finding. $ (Choice C)  Myelin protein gene mutations are involved in the pathogenesis of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, which presents with weakness of foot dorsiflexion due to involvement of the common peroneal nerve; sensory symptoms are typically less prominent. $ (Choice D)  Entrapment of a nerve within an anatomic compartment leads to compression neuropathy.  The most common example is carpal tunnel syndrome, which occurs due to compression of the median nerve at the wrist. $ (Choice E)  Abnormal signal transmission at the neuromuscular junction is characteristic of myasthenia gravis (MG), which occurs due to antibodies against acetylcholine receptors, and Lambert-Eaton syndrome (LES), which occurs due to antibodies against presynaptic calcium channels.  MG causes fatigable weakness that is most prominent in the proximal and facial muscles, while LES results in weakness that improves with repetition. $ Educational objective Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is characterized by numbness and paresthesia in a stocking-and-glove distribution.  It results from nonenzymatic glycosylation of proteins, leading to hyalinization of endoneurial arteries and ischemic nerve damage.  In addition, accumulation of toxic substances within neurons results in deranged metabolism and increased oxidative stress."

This paraneoplastic syndrome is most commonly associated with small cell lung cancer as well as breast, ovarian, and uterine malignancies.  Patients exhibit #progressively worsening dizziness, limb and truncal ataxia, dysarthria, and visual disturbances# (eg, diplopia, oscillopsia).  Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration is due to an immune response against tumor cells that #cross-reacts with Purkinje neuron antigens#, leading to acute-onset rapid degeneration of the cerebellum.  #Anti-Yo, anti-P/Q, and anti-Hu# are the most common antibodies detected in the serum.  Antibodies are not always detectable; thus, paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration is diagnosed clinically after excluding other conditions. $ (Choice B)  Some paraneoplastic syndromes occur due to the production of hormone-like substances from tumor cells, but these would not cause the neurological findings described in this case. $ (Choice C)  Acute cerebellitis (post-viral cerebellar ataxia) occurs most often in children 2-3 weeks following varicella, measles, or Epstein-Barr virus infection.  It presents with cerebellar symptoms (eg, ataxia, nystagmus, dysarthria) that usually resolve completely within 3 weeks. $ (Choice D)  Cerebellar metastasis can cause progressively worsening subacute cerebellar symptoms.  Additional findings such as headaches or decreased consciousness are often present due to significant mass effect from the tumor.  However, autopsy would show metastatic cancer cells with surrounding inflammation as opposed to Purkinje cell degeneration. $ (Choice E)  Adverse effects from systemic chemotherapy can include a wide range of neurologic complications.  However, this patient's symptoms began before the lung mass was identified and his autopsy findings are more specific for subacute cerebellar degeneration. $ (Choice F)  Cerebellar infarction presents with vertigo, nystagmus, ipsilateral limb ataxia, and truncal lateropulsion (falling toward the lesion).  Although repeated vascular events could result in a stepwise progressive loss in neurologic function, this process would most likely occur over several years and affect multiple vascular territories throughout the brain (causing a wide range of neurologic deficits).  Autopsy would show areas of liquefactive necrosis (acute infarcts) and glial scarring (chronic infarcts). $ Educational objective Paraneoplastic syndromes can occur due to the production of hormone-like substances from tumor cells.  They can also result from immune reactions against tumor cells that cross-react with normal cells, causing dysfunction and/or damage to healthy organs and tissues.  Neurologic paraneoplastic syndromes (eg, paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration) are an autoimmune phenomenon."

  "explanation_2": "Sometimes axons become severed due to trauma.  Such injury causes specific changes in both the proximal and distal segments of the axon, as well as in the neuronal body. $ Wallerian degeneration occurs in the segment of axon that has lost connection with the cell body.  It represents the degeneration of axon and myelin distal to a point of injury.  First, swelling and irregularity are noted in the distal segment of the axon.  Within a week the axon is destroyed and its fragments are digested by Schwann cells and macrophages.  Similar degenerative changes occur in the segment of axon that lies proximal to the injury.  Degeneration of the proximal segment extends to the closest node of Ranvier. $ The changes seen in the neuronal body after the axon is severed are called #axonal reaction#.  The cell body shows signs of cellular edema.  It becomes swollen and rounded, with the nucleus displaced to the periphery.  Nissl substance becomes fine, granular and dispersed throughout the cytoplasm (central chromatolysis).  Axonal reaction becomes visible in 24-48 hours after the injury.  Maximal changes in the neuronal body occur approximately 12 days after the injury.  These changes reflect an increased synthesis of protein by the cells in order to regenerate the severed axon. $ (Choice A)  Degenerative diseases are characterized by progressive loss of neurons with associated reactive glial changes.  Neuronal loss in these conditions is selective: it affects one or more well-defined neuronal groups.  Alzheimer's, Pick's, and Huntington's disease are all examples of degenerative disorders. $ (Choice B)  Transient but profound hypoxia, ischemia or toxic injury may lead to the loss of neurons.  Irreversible neuronal injury manifests with shrinkage of the neuronal body, deep eosinophilia of the cytoplasm, pyknosis of the nucleus and loss of Nissl substance. $ (Choice D)  Compression atrophy may occur due to increased intracranial pressure or a mass lesion.  A decrease in the size and number of neurons is characteristic of compression atrophy. $ (Choice E)  Normal aging is characterized by atrophy and gradual neuronal loss.  Axonal reaction is not associated with this process. $ Educational Objective The changes in the body of a neuron after the axon has been severed are called axonal reaction.  This process reflects an increased protein synthesis that facilitates axon repair.  Enlarged, rounded cells with peripherally located nuclei and dispersed finely granular Nissl substance are seen."

Abnormal prolactin secretion can also occur in nonprolactinoma tumors because, unlike secretion of other pituitary hormones, prolactin secretion is under @negative regulation by dopamine@ from the hypothalamus; any disruption of dopaminergic pathways in the pituitary stalk can cause a moderate increase in prolactin release. $ (Choice A)  Aldosterone is produced in the adrenal cortex, not the pituitary.  It is regulated primarily by the renin-angiotensin system. $ (Choice B)  Circulating catecholamines arise primarily from the adrenal medulla and, to a lesser extent, from spillover from sympathetic nervous system synapses.  Neuroendocrine tumors (eg, pheochromocytoma) can cause excess catecholamine release. $ (Choice C)  Most gonadotroph adenomas are hormonally nonfunctioning; ovarian hyperstimulation with an elevated estradiol level is uncommon.  In addition, prolactinomas commonly cause central hypogonadism with low estradiol levels due to @suppression of GnRH release@ from the hypothalamus. $ (Choice D)  The effects of growth hormone (GH) are largely mediated by insulin-like growth factor-1, which is produced in the liver in response to GH.  However, somatotroph adenomas (ie, GH-secreting tumors) are relatively rare and significantly less common than prolactin-secreting adenomas. $ (Choice E)  Melatonin is produced by the pineal gland and regulates circadian rhythm. $ (Choice G)  Vasopressin is produced in the hypothalamus and released by the posterior pituitary.

This, along with her prior episodes of optic neuritis (transient blurred vision and eye pain with movement), raises concern for #multiple sclerosis (MS)#, a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) caused by an autoimmune response directed at oligodendrocytes. $ In unmyelinated neurons, signal transmission requires sequential activation of adjacent sodium channels down the entire length of the axon.  In myelinated neurons, the depolarization impulse is regenerated at discrete points along the axon (nodes of Ranvier) where sodium channels are concentrated.  The myelin sheath serves as an electrical insulator that results in the impulse 'jumping' between 2 adjacent nodes #(saltatory conduction)#.  This process allows for myelinated neurons to transmit impulses >10x faster than unmyelinated neurons. $ Due to the #acute demyelination# seen with MS, propagation of the impulse cannot occur, as the distance between the sodium channels at the nodes of Ranvier precludes sequential activation.  This causes a #conduction block#.  Over time, sodium channels eventually redistribute across the naked axon and surviving oligodendrocytes partially remyelinate neurons, allowing for some restoration of signal transmission (explaining why some of the symptoms and signs of MS resolve to a variable extent). $ (Choice A)  Impaired neuromuscular transmission can be seen in myasthenia gravis, which is caused by autoantibodies against acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction.  Affected patients typically present with fluctuating diplopia, ptosis, and/or bulbar muscle weakness. $ (Choice B)  Loss of axons and neurons occurs over time in chronic multiple sclerosis plaques.

  "explanation_2": "Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is secreted by the choroid plexus of the lateral and fourth ventricles.  The path of CSF flow is as follows: lateral ventricles → interventricular foramen of Monro → the third ventricle → cerebral aqueduct → the fourth ventricle → the foramina of Luschka and Magendie → subarachnoid space.  In the subarachnoid space, CSF is absorbed by arachnoid granulations and then enters the venous sinuses.  The dynamic balance between production and absorption of CSF allows stable intracranial volume (120-150 ml) and pressure (50-180 mm H2O). $ If the normal flow of CSF from the ventriculi to the subarachnoid space is disrupted, #non-communicating hydrocephalus# occurs.  Ventriculi above the obstruction are enlarged, while those below the obstruction are normal.  Congenital anomalies, such as aqueductal stenosis, Arnold-Chiari or Dandy-Walker malformations, cause non-communicating hydrocephalus.  In all cases, the obstacle to CSF flow exists within the ventriculi. $ In #communicating hydrocephalus#, there is no obstruction to CSF flow from the ventriculi to the subarachnoid space.  Communicating hydrocephalus usually occurs secondary to dysfunction or obliteration of subarachnoid villi.  This dysfunction is usually a sequelae of meningeal infections (including tuberculosis meningitis, as in this patient) or subarachnoid/intraventricular hemorrhage.  In communicating hydrocephalus, all ventriculi are symmetrically enlarged, as in the image above. $ (Choice A)  The emissary veins pass through apertures between the intracranial sinuses and veins outside the cranial vault.  They do not participate in absorption of CSF. $ (Choice B)  Arachnoid trabeculae pass from the arachnoid through the subarachnoid space to the pia mater.  They are not involved in the metabolism of CSF. $ (Choice D)  The choroid plexus is the site of CSF secretion; in communicating hydrocephalus, CSF absorption, not secretion, is impaired.  If present, a choroid plexus papilloma might cause a symmetric ventricular enlargement that appears virtually identical to communicating hydrocephalus.  Communicating hydrocephalus is far more common than choroid plexus papilloma, however, making Choice D a plausible answer, but not the most likely one. $ #(Choice E and F)#  Neither dural septae nor communicating arteries are implicated in the pathogenesis of communicating hydrocephalus. $ Educational Objective Symmetrical enlargement of the ventriculi is characteristic of communicating hydrocephalus.  Communicating hydrocephalus usually occurs secondary to dysfunction or obliteration of subarachnoid villi.  This dysfunction is usually a sequelae of meningeal infection (including tuberculosis meningitis) or subarachnoid/intraventricular hemorrhage."

GBS is an acute, immune-mediated, demyelinating polyneuropathy thought to be due to molecular mimicry; infectious antigens provoke an immune response that cross-reacts with the myelin of the spinal roots and peripheral nerves, resulting in demyelination of peripheral nerves.  Patients develop a symmetric, ascending flaccid paralysis and areflexia leading to eventual respiratory failure; cranial nerve involvement can also occur.  This is typically preceded by an upper respiratory viral illness or an episode of diarrhea (due to Campylobacter jejuni). $ Histology demonstrates an #inflammatory infiltrate# located within the #endoneurium# (the innermost layer of connective tissue that surrounds a nerve axon and its corresponding blood vessel).  The infiltrate, consisting largely of lymphocytes and macrophages, extends from the small vessels (perivenular) to the associated nerve axon.  Macrophages strip the myelin sheath from the axon, and #lipid laden macrophages# are seen following the engulfment of myelin. $ (Choice A)  Endomysial inflammatory infiltration is characteristic of polymyositis (an immune-mediated inflammatory myopathy).

However, this occurs over an extended time (decades) in patients with long-standing, uncontrolled diabetes. $ (Choice D)  Mutations in the gene that codes for the muscle protein dystrophin can cause either a complete absence of this protein (Duchenne muscular dystrophy) or its decreased synthesis (Becker muscular dystrophy).  Both of these diseases cause progressive weakness and lead to eventual respiratory failure but weakness is worse proximally and patients present in early childhood with a waddling gait and calf enlargement. $ (Choice E)  Corynebacterium diphtheriae can cause neuropathies due to Diphtheria toxin penetration through the blood-nerve barrier; however, diphtheria usually presents as pharyngitis with pseudomembrane formation and stridor.  In addition, the neuropathy typically affects the cranial nerves prior to the peripheral nerves. $ Educational objective Guillain-Barré syndrome is an acute demyelinating polyneuropathy.  It is thought to be due to molecular mimicry and is commonly preceded by an upper respiratory viral illness or gastroenteritis.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient has suffered a subdural hematoma, an accumulation of blood between the dura mater and arachnoid.  The blood comes from the bridging cortical veins which carry blood from the cortex to the venous sinuses.  They can rupture as a result of acceleration-deceleration injury.  As the hematoma expands, it raises the intracranial pressure and compresses the brain.  Venous bleeding is relatively slow, which explains the #gradual onset of symptoms# in subdural hematoma.  Patients complain of gradually worsening headache and display a slow decline in mental function.  On CT scan, subdural hematoma is seen as a #crescent-shaped# mass. $ Subdural hematoma often occurs in elderly individuals after a minor trauma.  This increased incidence is explained by age-related brain atrophy.  As the distance from the skull to the brain surface increases, cortical bridging veins are under more tension and rupture more easily.  In elderly patients, subdural bleeding is called a 'great imitator' due to its subtle and variable presentation.  It may present as gait abnormalities, seizures, somnolence, confusion and memory loss.  These patients may go undiagnosed for weeks. $ (Choice A)  Rupture of the middle meningeal artery causes epidural hemorrhage.  Its clinical presentation is characterized by a 'lucid interval', followed by loss of consciousness.  A biconvex hematoma is seen on CT scan. $ (Choice C)  The lateral striate arteries arise from the middle cerebral arteries.  They are also called the penetrating branches.  These vessels supply the internal capsule and the basal ganglia, and often rupture in hypertensive strokes. $ #(Choices D and E)#  The posterior communicating artery is the second most common site of rupture of berry aneurysms in the circle of Willis (anterior communicating artery is the most common site).  This results in subarachnoid bleeding.  It manifests with a severe headache that may be described as \"the worst headache of my life\".  Fever and nuchal rigidity are commonly present. $ Educational objective Subdural hematoma occurs due to the rupture of cortical bridging veins.  In young patients, it results from a fall or motor vehicle accident, and manifests with gradual onset of headache and confusion.

  "explanation_2": "This patient with muscle weakness and gait abnormalities died of #pneumonia#, which is a common cause of death in patients with neurodegenerative diseases.  Autopsy showed #loss of both upper# (UMNs: corticospinal tracts) and #lower motor neurons# (LMNs: anterior roots of spinal cord, cranial nerve nuclei), which is consistent with #amyotrophic lateral sclerosis# (ALS). $ In patients with ALS, toxic intracellular protein inclusions accumulate in motor neurons and are thought to trigger #apoptosis#.  Bunina bodies are eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions that are periodic acid–Schiff positive and often seen in remaining neurons.  Apoptotic neurons are then replaced by glial cells. $ Loss of UMN fibers leads to atrophy of the #precentral motor gyrus# and degeneration of the #corticospinal tracts#, which results in increased muscle tone (stiffness) and hyperreflexia.  LMNs in cranial nerve nuclei (eg, hypoglossal, ambiguus, motor trigeminal) are often affected, which contributes to the bulbar symptoms often seen in ALS.  Loss of LMN fibers in the spinal cord leads to #thinning of the anterior roots# and neurogenic atrophy of the skeletal muscles.  Respiratory failure is the most common cause of death in patients with ALS due to diaphragmatic weakness, an ineffective cough, and chronic aspiration. $ (Choice B)  Friedreich ataxia shows widespread neuronal degeneration in the posterior columns, spinocerebellar tracts, cranial nerve nuclei, cerebellum, and motor cortex.  In addition, it typically manifests before adulthood and is associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; most patients die from arrhythmia or heart failure. $ (Choice C)  Although Guillain-Barré syndrome (ie, acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy) can lead to respiratory failure, it is characterized by inflammation and demyelination of peripheral nerves (including spinal nerve roots); CNS sites, including the precentral motor gyrus and cranial nerve nuclei, remain morphologically normal. $ (Choice D)  Multiple sclerosis is a demyelination disease characterized by irregularly shaped plaques in the white matter of the CNS.  Although regional demyelination can occur, atrophy affecting the entire motor pathway is not seen. (Choice E)  Vitamin B12 deficiency causes subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord due to defective myelin formation.  This is seen most prominently in the dorsal (posterior) and lateral spinal  columns.  Microscopically, edema of myelin layers is seen with eventual degeneration of neurons. $ Educational objective Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis causes both upper and lower motor neuron degenerative lesions.  Loss of upper motor neurons leads to atrophy of the precentral motor gyrus and degeneration of the corticospinal tracts.  Loss of lower motor neurons leads to thinning of the anterior roots of the spinal cord and atrophy of cranial nerve motor nuclei."

FTD is characterized by degeneration of the prefrontal cortex, which progresses to include the anterior temporal lobes.  The disease process results in accumulation of different #neurotoxic proteins#, including: $ •#Tau#, a protein associated with neuronal microtubules that normally takes part in microtubule stabilization.  In patients with FTD, tau becomes #hyperphosphorylated# and disassociates from the microtubules, which may lead to instability and disrupted axonal transport.  It also forms paired helical filaments, which create @intracellular tangled clumps@ of tau proteins predominantly in the frontal and temporal lobes, as well as the hippocampi.  Tau-related neurofibrillary tangles are also found in patients with Alzheimer dementia. $ • #TDP-43# (transactive response DNA-binding protein 43), a protein that normally functions as a transcription inhibitor or a DNA repair protein.  #Abnormal ubiquitination# leads to immunoreactive inclusions of TDP-43.  Pathologic TDP-43 is also found in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. $ #(Choices A and C)#  CAG trinucleotide (polyglutamine) repeats can lead to neurotoxic protein formation.  When this occurs in the ataxin genes, it can lead to spinocerebellar ataxia.  When it occurs in the huntingtin protein, it leads to Huntington disease, which can present with prominent changes in mood or cognition.  However, both spinocerebellar ataxia and Huntington disease also typically present with significant gait abnormalities (ie, ataxia). $ (Choice B)  Extracellular accumulation of beta-amyloid occurs in Alzheimer disease.  Alzheimer disease commonly presents with early and prominent memory impairment with language deficits and spatial disorientation.  Although personality changes can occur, they typically occur later in the disease process.  This patient's early personality changes are more characteristic of FTD. $ (Choice D)  Excessive prion accumulation causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.  Although behavioral changes are common, dementia is rapidly progressive and associated with myoclonus and/or seizures. $ Educational objective Frontotemporal dementia presents with early personality change, executive dysfunction, compulsivity, and hyperorality.  It is associated with neurofibrillary tangles due to abnormal tau proteins (also seen in Alzheimer dementia) and pathologically ubiquitinated TDP-43 (also seen in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis).",

Space-occupying intracranial lesions classically present with a headache that is worse in the morning and with Valsalva (eg, bearing down, coughing) due to increased intracranial pressure. $ The facial nerve exits the @brainstem@ at the pontomedullary junction and subsequently enters the internal auditory meatus and facial canal in the temporal bone.  Here, it gives off branches that supply the stapedius muscle (reduces volume by dampening ossicle movement in middle ear), salivary glands (eg, sublingual, submandibular), and lacrimal glands.  It also provides taste from the anterior two thirds of the tongue via the chorda tympani nerve.  After exiting the skull through the stylomastoid foramen, the facial nerve courses within the parotid gland and its terminal branches innervate the muscles of facial expression. $ Facial nerve palsy presents with ipsilateral @facial paralysis@ (eg, flattening of the nasolabial fold, drooping of the lower lip, inability to close the eye).  There is also #loss of the corneal reflex# (efferent limb) due to denervation of the orbicularis oculi muscle.

  "explanation_2": "#Subarachnoid hemorrhage# (SAH) is a life-threatening condition that most commonly results from rupture of a saccular (berry) aneurysm.  It classically manifests with the abrupt onset of severe headache #(thunderclap headache)#; confusion, loss of consciousness, and meningismus may also occur.  Noncontrast head CT scan reveals blood in the subarachnoid space (between the arachnoid and pia mater). $ If the patient survives the initial SAH, a number of complications (eg, rebleeding, hydrocephalus, seizures) may occur in the following days to weeks.  The most common is #arterial vasospasm#, which occurs due to the release of vasoconstrictive factors from damaged erythrocytes in the subarachnoid space and the inability of damaged vascular endothelial cells to produce vasodilators (eg, nitric oxide).  The resultant unopposed vasoconstriction can cause #delayed cerebral ischemia#, which manifests as a change in mental status and/or new #focal neurological deficits# 3-12 days after the SAH. $ #CT scan# usually reveals #no significant changes# despite the severity of the ischemia following vasospasm.  Nimodipine, a selective calcium channel blocker, is used after SAH to promote vasodilation and prevent calcium-dependent excitotoxicity, which improves outcomes by reducing the incidence and extent of ischemia due to cerebral vasospasm. $ #(Choices A, B, and E)# Although arterial thrombosis, embolism, and vascular inflammation could all cause a change in mental status and focal neurologic deficits, they are not significant complications of SAH. $ (Choice C)  Hydrocephalus may occur hours to days after SAH due to blood breakdown products obstructing the flow of cerebrospinal fluid or clogging the arachnoid villi.  Patients develop signs of elevated intracranial pressure (eg, nausea/vomiting), and neuroimaging demonstrates ventricular dilation. $ (Choice D)  Rebleeding after initial SAH carries a high mortality rate and usually occurs early (<24 hours) after the initial bleed.  Although symptoms can include a sudden change in level of consciousness and appearance of new neurological deficits, rebleeding is very rare 4 days after a successfully repaired aneurysmal rupture and CT scan would demonstrate newly extravasated blood. $ Educational objective The most common complication of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage is vasospasm, which typically occurs 3-12 days after the initial insult and can cause delayed cerebral ischemia (eg, sudden change in mental status, new focal neurological deficits).  The CT scan usually remains unchanged, unlike with rebleeding."

  "explanation_2": "$#Myasthenia gravis# (MG) is an acquired autoimmune disorder characterized by fatigable, fluctuating weakness of the skeletal muscles.  The most commonly affected muscles include #ocular# (diplopia, ptosis), bulbar (dysarthria, fatigable chewing), facial (loss of smile), and proximal (#neck/shoulder weakness#) muscles.  However, #respiratory failure# (↓ pH, ↑ pCO2, ↓ O2) can also occur due to diaphragmatic weakness (ie, myasthenic crisis), and may be the presenting symptom in some patients. $ MG is caused by an autoantibody-mediated, T cell–dependent attack on the acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) of the postsynaptic neuromuscular junction. #Antibody-mediated blockade# of the active site of AChRs prevents acetylcholine from binding and also triggers #endocytosis# of AChRs (receptor internalization) as well as #complement-mediated membrane damage#.  Over time, these changes result in #reduced numbers of AchRs# and impaired neuromuscular transmission. $ (Choice A)  @Botulinum toxin@ irreversibly blocks acetylcholine release from presynaptic membranes of neuromuscular junctions.  After exposure to the toxin, patients may develop cranial nerve abnormalities (including ptosis and facial weakness), symmetric descending weakness, and respiratory failure.  However, autonomic abnormalities are common, and symptoms are rapidly progressive (hours rather than weeks) and do not worsen with repetition. $ #(Choices B and E)#  The @action of acetylcholine@ at the postsynaptic membrane is terminated by acetylcholinesterase, not by acetylcholine reuptake.  Organophosphates (eg, pesticides, sarin gas) irreversibly inactivate acetylcholinesterase, causing cholinergic toxicity (eg, increased glandular secretions, widespread smooth muscle activation).  Muscle weakness, including respiratory failure, can occur due to depolarizing blockade at the neuromuscular junction; however, other symptoms (eg, diarrhea, urination, miosis, bradycardia, emesis, salivation) would be expected. $ (Choice C)  @Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome@ is due to autoantibodies directed against the voltage-gated calcium channels on presynaptic nerve terminals, leading to reduced calcium entry and impaired acetylcholine release.  This syndrome commonly occurs in association with malignancy, particularly small cell lung cancer (which would be atypical in this young female), and generally causes proximal extremity weakness that is worse in the mornings and #improves# with repetition.  Autonomic findings (eg, dry mouth, erectile dysfunction in males) are frequently seen and can be an important clue to diagnosis. $ Educational objective Myasthenia gravis is caused by an autoantibody-mediated attack on the acetylcholine receptors of the postsynaptic neuromuscular junction, leading to a reduced number of acetylcholine receptors.  It is characterized by fatigable weakness of the skeletal muscles; respiratory failure can occur due to diaphragmatic weakness.",

  "explanation_2": "Voluntary muscle activity is mediated by the #corticospinal (pyramidal) tracts#.  First-order neurons of these tracts are located in the premotor and motor cortex of the frontal lobe (Brodmann areas 6 and 4, respectively).  Their efferent fibers descend through the internal capsule, midbrain, and pons, and continue to form the pyramids on the anterior aspect of the medulla.  In the medulla, 90% of the fibers decussate (cross) to form the @lateral corticospinal tract@.  Fibers that do not decussate descend as the @anterior corticospinal tract@.  The axons of both tracts synapse on the motor neurons of the anterior horn (second-order neurons).  Damage to the corticospinal tract is divided into upper and lower motor neuron lesions: $ 1. #Upper motor neuron# (UMN) refers to anything above the anterior horn.  Lesions to UMNs (eg, due to stroke, brain tumor) cause a combination of #spastic paralysis#, clasp-knife #rigidity, hyperreflexia# (including clonus), and upgoing plantar reflexes (#Babinski sign#).  This likely occurs due to loss of descending inhibition over second-order neurons in the anterior horn. $ 2. Damage to the motor neurons of the anterior horn is considered a lower motor neuron (LMN) lesion.

MS is an autoimmune disorder of the #central nervous system# (CNS) characterized by lesions of focal #demyelination#. $ Demyelination involves both cellular and humoral immunity.  Helper T cells react with myelin antigens and recruit additional lymphocytes and macrophages.  Activated CD8+ T cells release cytotoxic granules that injure oligodendrocytes.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient with impaired memory and cognition, unsteady gait, and urinary incontinence has @ventriculomegaly@ without sulcal enlargement on MRI, which is characteristic of #normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH)#.  NPH can occur due to decreased absorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by the arachnoid granulations (eg, fibrosis from previous cerebral inflammation or bleeding) with gradual accumulation of CSF in the ventricular system.  The lateral ventricles expand, resulting in normal intracranial pressure and #stretching the descending cortical fibers# (corona radiata).  Interruption of these pathways, along with impairment of cortical and subcortical function, leads to the classic triad of NPH symptoms (#dementia, gait disturbance, urinary incontinence#). $ The cerebral cortex (through the pontine micturition center) regulates the @micturition reflex@, which is an autonomic spinal reflex mediated by the neurons in the sacral spinal cord.  In NPH, the #lack of cortical inhibition# results in #detrusor muscle hyperactivity#.  This leads to urinary urgency, which can be worsened by gait abnormalities that limit a patient's ability to quickly get to a bathroom (#urge incontinence#).  Progressive frontal lobe impairment leads to the inability to recognize urinary urge, uncontrolled urination, and a lack of concern as the disease progresses. $ (Choice A)  Cerebellar dysfunction can cause an ataxic gait, dysarthria, and intention tremors.  Memory dysfunction and urinary incontinence are more indicative of cerebral impairment.  NPH typically spares cerebellar function. $ (Choice B)  Compression of the reticular formation can occur with brainstem herniation, leading to loss of consciousness and coma. $ (Choice C)  Impaired basal ganglia signaling is characteristic of Parkinson disease, which can result in ataxia with a slow gait.  However, cogwheel rigidity and resting tremor would be prominent and dementia and urinary incontinence would not be expected until later in the disease course. $ (Choice D)  Spinal cord damage is a common cause of incontinence with gait impairment.  However, spinal cord injury also frequently causes lower extremity weakness and is not associated with cognitive impairment. $ Educational objective Normal pressure hydrocephalus occurs due to decreased cerebrospinal fluid absorption, resulting in ventriculomegaly with normal intracranial pressure.  This causes stretching of the descending cortical fibers (corona radiata) from the frontal lobe and contributes to the classic triad of symptoms (ie, dementia, gait abnormalities, urinary incontinence).  Loss of cortical inhibition of the sacral micturition center leads to urge incontinence.",

  "explanation_2": "#Measles virus# is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus that is a member of the paramyxovirus family.  Its genome codes for several viral structural proteins, including membrane-bound #hemagglutinin# (mediates cell surface adhesion) and #matrix protein# (important for viral assembly). $ #Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE)# is a rare complication of measles that occurs in children or young adults several years after the initial infection.  It is thought to be caused by a form of measles virus with a mutated or #absent matrix protein# that prevents mature (enveloped) virion particles from forming.  However, the virus continues to replicate intracellularly, leading to a persistent, nonproductive infection that evades eradication by the immune system.  #Accumulation of viral nucleocapsids# within neurons and oligodendrocytes results in the formation of intranuclear inclusions and eventually leads to inflammation, demyelination, and gliosis in many cerebral areas. $ Patients with SSPE have high titers of #measles antibodies# in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (detectable as oligoclonal bands).  The disease causes various neurologic deficits and dementia, and is relentlessly progressive and fatal. $ (Choice A)  Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a rare form of rapidly progressive dementia that is caused by prions (abnormally folded proteins).  It usually occurs in older patients (sporadic form), although younger patients can be affected after consuming prion-infected meat products (acquired or variant form).  Brain biopsy will show spongiform transformation of the cerebral cortex. $ (Choice B)  Guillain-Barré syndrome is a postinfectious autoimmune demyelinating disorder of the peripheral nervous system.  It most commonly presents as a symmetrical ascending weakness with absent reflexes following an infectious respiratory or diarrheal illness. $ (Choice C)  Multiple sclerosis usually manifests in patients 20-30 years old.  It is characterized by a variety of visual (eg, optic neuritis, internuclear ophthalmoplegia) and sensory deficits occurring in a relapsing/remitting pattern.  Brain biopsy will show focal demyelinated plaques with relative axonal sparing. $ (Choice D)  Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is an infectious demyelinating disorder caused by JC virus, a double-stranded DNA virus in the polyomavirus family.  JC virus manifests with progressive neurologic deficits in immunocompromised individuals (eg, lymphoma, leukemia, or HIV infection). $ (Choice E)  Progressive supranuclear palsy is a form of parkinsonism resulting from neurodegeneration of the midbrain and frontal subcortical white matter.  It presents with rapidly progressive gait dysfunction and falls, executive function loss, and vertical gaze palsy.  Brain biopsy usually shows deposits of abnormally phosphorylated tau proteins. $ Educational objective Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis is a rare complication of measles infection that occurs several years after apparent recovery from initial infection.  Oligoclonal bands of measles virus antibodies are found in the cerebrospinal fluid of these patients."

  "explanation_2": "#Lung cancers# are prone to early local and distant spread.  Intrathoracic expansion of a tumor can cause a number of distinctive syndromes, including #phrenic nerve# irritation and palsy. $ The phrenic nerve arises from the #C3-C5# cervical segments and descends through the neck and thorax to innervate the ipsilateral hemidiaphragm.  Phrenic nerve #irritation# can cause dyspnea, hiccups (diaphragmatic irritation), and #referred pain to the shoulder# (area innervated by supraclavicular nerve originating from C3 and C4).  Phrenic nerve #palsy# is associated with respiratory distress and diminished breath sounds on the affected side, with elevation of the affected hemidiaphragm on chest x-ray.  Upward movement of the affected hemidiaphragm with inspiration is seen on fluoroscopy. $ Other syndromes that may occur due to local spread of a lung tumor include: $ • #Horner syndrome# (ipsilateral miosis, ptosis, and anhydrosis) occurs in association with tumors of the lung apex (#Pancoast tumor#) that disrupt the oculosympathetic nerve pathway.  Lung cancer in this location can also invade the rami of the #brachial plexus# (C5-T1) and cause shoulder pain #(choices D and E)#. $ • A centrally located tumor or mediastinal spread of a more distant tumor can cause #superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome#, which is commonly associated with small cell lung carcinoma.  SVC syndrome causes headache, facial and upper-extremity edema, and dilated veins of the upper torso. $ • Involvement of the recurrent laryngeal nerve may cause hoarseness. $ • Dysphagia may result if the tumor compresses the esophagus. $ (Choice A)  The brainstem, which is the site of origin of most cranial nerves, contains the respiratory center (in the medulla oblongata) and is traversed by spinal tracts.  Brainstem strokes typically present with vertigo and, in extreme cases, can lead to locked-in syndrome (spastic quadriplegia and paralysis of most cranial nerves with preserved consciousness). $ (Choice B)  C1 is unique among the spinal nerves in that it carries only motor fibers.  C1-C3 lesions could affect neck musculature but would not explain this patient's hiccups or dyspnea. $ Educational objective The phrenic nerve arises from the C3-C5 segments of the spinal cord and innervates the ipsilateral hemidiaphragm.  Intrathoracic spread of lung cancer may affect the phrenic nerve, causing hiccups and diaphragmatic paralysis with dyspnea.  Brachial plexus involvement can cause pain in the distribution of the C8, T1, and T2 nerve roots.  Involvement of the recurrent laryngeal nerve may cause hoarseness."

Blood in the subarachnoid space can acutely obstruct and #impair absorption# of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) by the #arachnoid granulations#.  Later, blood-induced inflammation can cause fibrosis of the arachnoid granulations that perpetuates the absorption impairment and leads to chronic hydrocephalus. $ Impaired CSF absorption creates a #communicating# hydrocephalus.  Because the blockage to flow is distal to the entire @ventricular system@, #enlargement of all 4 ventricles# occurs.  The ventricular enlargement stretches adjacent nerve fibers and, in the acute setting, leads to #deteriorating mental status# (eg, somnolence, unresponsiveness).  Treatment involves the placement of an @external ventricular drain@ to relieve pressure in the ventricular system and subarachnoid space. $ (Choice A)  Blockage of the cerebral aqueduct (aqueduct of Sylvius) is less common with SAH and more typically occurs with intracerebral hemorrhage complicated by intraventricular bleeding.  The resulting hydrocephalus is noncommunicating because there is no free passage of CSF from the ventricular space into the subarachnoid space.  Enlargement of only the lateral and third ventricles is expected; the fourth ventricle is distal to the obstruction and remains normal in size. $ (Choice B)  Cerebral vasospasm is a common complication of SAH; however, it is typically delayed, occurring 4-14 days following the initial bleed, and leads to localized stroke with focal neurologic deficits rather than deteriorating mental status.  Dilated ventricles are not seen. $ (Choice C)  Edema that occurs due to disruption of the blood-brain barrier (vasogenic cerebral edema) collects within the brain parenchyma and can result from stroke or trauma.  It is not expected following SAH. $ (Choice D)  Excessive CSF production is a rare cause of communicating hydrocephalus that may result from a choroid plexus papilloma.  Enlargement of all 4 ventricles is expected, but this patient's SAH makes impaired absorption of CSF far more likely. $ Educational objective Communicating hydrocephalus is a common complication of subarachnoid hemorrhage that presents with deteriorating mental status.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient most likely has #syringomyelia#, which classically presents with disproportionate #loss of pain and temperature sensation# (dissociated anesthesia) involving the #arms and hands#.  In syringomyelia, a cerebrospinal fluid-filled cavity called a syrinx usually forms in the cervical region of the spinal cord.  These cavities can enlarge over time and destroy adjacent portions of the spinal cord.  The areas most commonly damaged are the ventral white commissure and ventral horns. $ The ventral white commissure is located just anterior to the gray commissure.  It is the area of decussation for the fibers of the @lateral spinothalamic tract@, which transmits pain and temperature sensation from peripheral receptors to the somatosensory cortex.  Destruction of the #ventral white commissure# leads to loss of pain and temperature sensation bilaterally over the affected dermatomes (starting 1 to 2 levels below the lesion, as the axons briefly ascend in the zone of Lissauer before decussating).  Touch, vibration, and position senses are preserved as the dorsal columns remain intact. $ (Choice B)  The ventral horns contain lower motor neurons that receive impulses from the lateral corticospinal tract.  Damage to the ventral horn can occur in syringomyelia, but would cause flaccid paralysis and atrophy of the intrinsic hand muscles (not loss of pain and temperature sensation). $ (Choice C)  The ventral spinothalamic tract is located in this area and transmits crude touch and pressure sensation.  It should not be confused with the lateral spinothalamic tract, which carries pain and temperature sensation. $ (Choice D)  After decussating in the ventral white commissure, axons of the lateral spinothalamic tract ascend to the brain in the lateral funiculus.  Damage to this area would cause contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation distally, beginning 1 to 2 segments below the lesion.  However, bilateral sensory loss would not occur with damage to this area. $ (Choice E)  The dorsal horn contains first order axons and second order neurons that transmit sensory input from peripheral receptors.  Damage to the dorsal horn would likely result in unilateral loss of all sensation over the affected dermatomes. $ (Choice F)  The dorsal column contains both the gracile and cuneate fasciculi.  They are formed by axons of first-order neurons of the dorsal column pathway.  This tract is the primary mediator of proprioception, vibration, and tactile sensation. $ Educational objective Syringomyelia is characterized by the formation of a cavity (syrinx) in the cervical region of the spinal cord.  The syrinx damages the ventral white commissure, leading to bilateral loss of pain and temperature sensation that is limited to the affected levels (typically the arms and hands); distal sensation is preserved.  Destruction of the motor neurons in the ventral horns (due to extension of the syrinx) results in flaccid paralysis and atrophy of the intrinsic muscles of the hand.",

Degeneration of the axon usually begins within a few days after lesion onset. $ In the peripheral nervous system, Schwann cells sense the axonal degeneration and begin to degrade their myelin and secrete cytokines and chemokines that recruit macrophages.  This allows effective clearance of myelin debris which, along with trophic factor secretion by Schwann cells, stimulates formation of a growth cone from the stump of the proximal axon and facilitates nerve regeneration. $ In the #central nervous system#, phagocytic macrophages/microglia are recruited more slowly because of the blood-brain barrier.  Myelin-producing oligodendrocytes also become inactive or undergo apoptosis and do not assist with phagocytosis.  This slows removal of the #myelin debris#, which can #persist for years# in the degenerating tracts and suppress axonal growth via myelin-associated inhibitory factors.  Astrocytes also release inhibitory molecules and proliferate in the weeks to months following injury, forming a #glial scar# that acts as a #barrier# to axon regeneration. $ (Choice A)  Calcification of an ischemic infarction may occur months to years after the event; however, this is a rare occurrence.  Brain calcification is most commonly seen with certain neoplasms (eg, oligodendroglioma), infections (eg, neurocysticercosis), and vascular malformations. $ #(Choices B and G)#  Cytotoxic and vasogenic edema typically occur in the acute setting after ischemic neuronal injury.  Cytotoxic edema is a type of intracellular edema caused by impaired function of ATP-dependent sodium/potassium pumps on neuronal cell membranes.  In contrast, vasogenic edema is a type of extracellular edema caused by increased vascular permeability due to the effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines. $ (Choice C)  In the first 12-24 hours after ischemic stroke, affected neurons classically shrink and develop intense cytoplasmic eosinophilia (red neurons) with pyknosis of the nucleus. $ (Choice D)  Embolic ischemic strokes have a high risk of undergoing acute hemorrhagic transformation within the first 7 days following the ischemic event. $ (Choice E)  Neutrophilic infiltration progressively increases up to 48 hours after ischemic stroke and then diminishes. $ Educational objective Wallerian degeneration refers to the process of axonal degeneration and breakdown of the myelin sheath that occurs distal to a site of injury.  Axonal regeneration does not occur in the central nervous system due to the persistence of myelin debris, secretion of neuronal inhibitory factors, and development of dense glial scarring."

With further hemorrhagic expansion, horizontal shifts in midline structures or #brain herniation# may occur. $ Progressive pupillary abnormalities are common in herniation.  @Uncal herniation@ initially disrupts the ipsilateral oculomotor nerve (CN III) leading to a #fixed dilated pupil#; however, as the brainstem becomes inferiorly displaced (ie, #central herniation#), damage to the midbrain and upper pons typically results in bilateral #midpositioned and fixed pupils# due to loss of both sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation. $ Brain herniation also causes abnormal posturing from disruption of descending tracts (eg, rubrospinal, vestibulospinal) typically involved in reflexive and postural movements.

  "explanation_2": "This patient with recurrent seizures has an epileptogenic focus in the temporal lobe, #suggesting temporal lobe epilepsy# (TLE), the most common type of localization-related (ie, focal) epilepsy.  Localization epilepsies occur when partial seizures originate from one area of the brain and are usually due to an underlying structural disorder which serves as an epileptogenic focus.  In the case of TLE, this is most commonly due to #hippocampal sclerosis#, which is usually visible as @hippocampal atrophy@ on MRI. $ The pathogenesis of hippocampal sclerosis is incompletely understood but may in some cases be related to prior prolonged febrile seizures, particularly in patients with an underlying genetic predisposition.  This results in the characteristic histopathologic findings of #atrophy of the hippocampal neurons# with marked reactive gliosis (#astrocyte proliferation# in response to injury).  Surgical resection may reduce or cure seizures associated with TLE. $ (Choice B)  Hemosiderin-laden macrophages are associated with prior intracerebral hemorrhage, which may cause seizures but typically presents acutely with altered mental status and focal neurologic deficits.  Neuroimaging would demonstrate expanding blood, not a focal abnormality in the hippocampus. $ (Choice C)  Microglial nodules form when cells of microglia surround a neuron and phagocytize it.  The nodules are most commonly seen in viral CNS infection (particularly HIV) and are not typically associated with TLE. $ (Choice D)  Neuronal inclusion bodies are often seen in frontotemporal dementia (characterized by prominent personality/behavioral changes and atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes on neuroimaging) and Parkinson disease (characterized by bradykinesia, rigidity, pill-rolling tremor, and dementia).  These disorders occur in elderly patients and are not associated with seizures. $ (Choice E)  Spongiform changes occur in prion diseases (eg, Creutzfeldt-Jacob, kuru).  Patients have progressive tremors, ataxia, and dementia.  Electroencephalography reveals periodic sharp-wave complexes, not focal epileptiform discharges, and hippocampal abnormalities are unexpected. $ Educational objective Temporal lobe epilepsy is most commonly due to hippocampal sclerosis.  Histopathology of hippocampal sclerosis demonstrates atrophy of the hippocampal neurons with marked reactive gliosis (astrocyte proliferation in response to injury).",

This is consistent with #vascular dementia# (VaD), which often occurs due to one of the following mechanisms: $ • Atherosclerosis of large vessels (eg, basilar arteries, carotid arteries, circle of Willis):  Plaque accumulation narrows the lumen; plaque rupture can lead to thrombosis and #thromboembolism#, often causing a #clinical stroke#, resulting in localized neurologic deficits.  MRI would reveal a discrete cortical infarct. $ • @Small-vessel disease@, which includes the development of microatheromas and #arteriolosclerosis# (ie, thickening and stiffening of arteriole walls):  Small-vessel disease can lead to microaneurysm formation, obstruction, or breakage of the vessel walls.  It more often impacts #subcortical regions# (eg, thalamus, basal ganglia) because there is less arteriole collateralization in these regions compared to the cerebral cortex.  MRI often reveals signs of multiple small infarcts or microbleeds in these areas. $ • #Cerebral amyloid angiopathy#:  Beta-amyloid deposits in the walls of small to medium cerebral arteries and leads to increased fragility of the vessels.  Although the most common manifestation is spontaneous, @lobar intracranial hemorrhage@, it can also cause multiple small infarcts and present as VaD.  $(Choice A)  Although patients with Alzheimer dementia also have progressive memory loss with functional impairments, this disease often has a more insidious onset than VaD.  MRI typically reveals parietotemporal cortical atrophy with no evidence of structural disease.  $ (Choice B)  Although brain metastases can result in a rapidly deteriorating mental status, they most often cause focal neurologic findings, which are not seen in this patient, and would be visible on MRI as @mass lesions@, usually located at the gray-white matter junction. $ (Choice C)  MRI in a patient with multiple sclerosis can reveal @hyperintensities@ corresponding to demyelinating plaques, typically located in the periventricular areas.  However, MS typically presents in young women (age <50) with neurologic deficits (eg, blurry vision, diplopia, focal weakness/numbness, bowel/bladder dysfunction) disseminated in time and space. $ (Choice E)  Although Wernicke encephalopathy (due to thiamine deficiency) can present with cognitive deficits, the classic triad consists of oculomotor dysfunction, ataxia, and encephalopathy.  Chronic thiamine deficiency results in anterograde and retrograde amnesia, confabulation, and apathy.

Miosis and lacrimation are unexpected. $#(Choice D)#  Opiate withdrawal can cause lacrimation, rhinorrhea, and diaphoresis, but would usually cause bilateral symptoms.  It typically also causes gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, diarrhea, nausea), piloerection, and mydriasis; orbital pain is unexpected. $#(Choice E)#  Trigeminal neuralgia (tic douloureux) causes sudden, 'electric' pain in the distribution of the maxillary and/or mandibular divisions of the trigeminal nerve, often preceded by light touch.  Episodes last for seconds and do not typically occur during sleep. $#(Choice F)#  Vertebrobasilar ischemia can cause headaches but also typically causes dizziness, double vision or vision loss, and ataxia. $#Educational objective# Cluster headaches cause severe, episodic, unilateral periorbital and temporal pain associated with ipsilateral autonomic symptoms (eg, lacrimation, nasal congestion, miosis, conjunctival injection).

Compression most commonly occurs due to an #abnormal vascular loop#, neoplastic growth, or multiple sclerosis plaque. $#(Choice A)#  Inflammatory degradation of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) can lead to TMJ disorder, which often causes pain with jaw movement (eg, chewing).  However, pain due to the TMJ is classically dull and waxing and waning rather than neuropathic (eg, shock-like).  Clicking/popping noises with jaw movement are common, as are ear-related symptoms (eg, ear pain, stuffiness, tinnitus). $#(Choice C)#  Reactivation of herpes zoster virus in a sensory ganglion can lead to herpetic neuralgia, which can impact CN V.  Dermatomal pain can precede development of the classic vesicular rash by several days.  However, seconds-long paroxysms of pain triggered by eating and unaccompanied by a rash after a month are more consistent with TN. $#(Choice D)#  Herpesvirus-mediated inflammatory demyelination may underlie the development of Bell palsy (idiopathic palsy of the facial nerve [CN VII]).  However, this usually does not cause pain but instead results in unilateral facial weakness.  In TN, demyelination and atrophy are due to compression of the nerve root. $#Educational objective#Trigeminal neuralgia is caused by compression of the trigeminal nerve (CN V) root as it enters the pons, usually by an abnormal vessel loop.

  "explanation_2": "$#Schwannomas# are tumors of the peripheral nervous system that arise from Schwann cells.  Microscopically, they appear @biphasic@ with highly cellular areas (Antoni A pattern) intermixed with myxoid regions of low cellularity (Antoni B pattern).  The Antoni A areas are composed of spindle cells with #elongated, wavy nuclei# that form palisading patterns with interspersing nuclear-free zones called Verocay bodies.  Schwannomas are universally #S-100 positive# due to their neural crest cell origin.  Another important S-100 positive tumor is melanoma (also derived from the neural crest). $Schwann cells are to the peripheral nervous system as oligodendrocytes are to the central nervous system:  both protect and insulate axons.  The transition from oligodendrocytes to Schwann cells occurs within a few millimeters from the surface of the brain and spinal cord.  Therefore, schwannomas can occur within the cranial vault and spinal canal.  Schwannomas may arise from any cranial nerve except the optic nerve (CN II) and olfactory nerve (CN I), which are not covered by Schwann cells. $The most common site of intracranial schwannomas is the #cerebellopontine angle# at CN VIII.  Schwannomas in this particular location are also called acoustic neuromas, and can present with #tinnitus, vertigo#, and sensorineural #hearing loss#. $#(Choice A)#  @Glioblastoma@ is a highly aggressive primary brain tumor that consists of bizarre-looking glial cells with multiple mitotic figures, pseudopalisading necrosis, and abundant neovascularization and hemorrhage.  It commonly occurs in the frontotemporoparietal white matter and grows along the white matter tracts across the corpus callosum to affect the opposite hemisphere. $#(Choice B)#  @Meningiomas@ are typically slow-growing extra-axial tumors that arise from the meningothelial cells of the arachnoid.  Meningiomas most commonly appear as cells arranged in lobules or whorls with or without psammoma bodies (laminar calcifications). $#(Choice C)#  Brain metastases are the most common cause of intracranial tumors in adults.  Lung, breast, skin (melanoma), and renal cancer are particularly likely to metastasize to the brain.  Metastatic brain lesions typically form well-circumscribed masses along the grey-white junction.  Histologically, there is often necrosis with surrounding areas of reactive gliosis and edema. $#(Choice D)#  Optic glioma is a form of glioma that affects the optic nerve.  It is often found in association with neurofibromatosis type 1.  Histologic findings are usually consistent with pilocytic astrocytoma and include tumor cells with hairlike processes, microcystic areas, and Rosenthal fibers (elongated or corkscrew intracytoplasmic eosinophilic bundles). $#Educational objective# Schwannomas present histologically with a biphasic pattern of cellularity (Antoni A and B areas) and S-100 positivity (indicating neural crest origin).  Schwannomas can arise from the peripheral nerves, nerve roots, and cranial nerves (except CN II and CN I).  Acoustic neuromas are the most common type of intracranial schwannoma and are located at the cerebellopontine angle at CN VIII. ",

The fixed volume of the skull necessitates that a significant increase in volume of any component of the CNS (eg, brain tissue, blood, cerebrospinal fluid) will raise ICP.  This increased ICP can cause progressive #neurologic impairment# through direct pressure-induced cell injury or mechanical damage due to @brain herniation@. $Irreversible ischemic neural and glial cell injury initiates a sequence of chemical changes that promote edema: $•#Cytotoxic (ionic) edema# begins hours after the ischemic injury due to decreased ATP.  The failure of #ATP-dependent ion pumps#, combined with the release of excitatory amino acids (eg, glutamate), leads to the accumulation of intracellular Na+ and water in neural and glial cells despite an intact blood-brain barrier. $•#Vasogenic edema# follows 24-48 hours later, when the release of inflammatory mediators disrupts the tight junctions of the blood-brain barrier, allowing proteins (eg, albumin) and water to enter the interstitial space.  This vasogenic phase can cause persistent cerebral edema for weeks after the initial injury. $#(Choice A)#  Although a decrease in oncotic pressure can cause peripheral edema (eg, nephrotic syndrome), it is not a significant factor in the development of cerebral edema.  Mannitol is used in the treatment of cerebral edema because it increases plasma oncotic pressure and temporarily disrupts the blood-brain barrier, allowing movement of fluid out of the CNS to decrease ICP. $#(Choice C)#  Inadequate absorption of cerebrospinal fluid at the arachnoid granulations can cause communicating hydrocephalus.  Although this process raises ICP, ventriculomegaly would likely be prominent on CT scan. $#(Choice D)#  Increased hydrostatic pressure secondary to central venous thrombosis or hypertensive encephalopathy can cause cerebral edema and increased ICP.  However, patients typically have gradually worsening headache before development of neurologic abnormalities. $#(Choice E)#  Gliosis is the process of repairing damaged tissue in the CNS by proliferating astrocytes and microglia.  This process occurs slowly in the months to years after CNS injury and would not be expected to cause acute changes in ICP. $#Educational objective# The primary mechanism underlying cytotoxic (early) edema following cerebral ischemia is the accumulation of intracellular Na+ and water due to the failure of ATP-dependent ion transporters in hypoxic cells.  Cerebral edema causes progressive neurologic decline by raising intracranial pressure, which can directly damage neural tissue or result in mechanical damage due to brain herniation.",

Because the cranial vault is rigid, there is minimal space for brain expansion if a #rapidly enlarging mass# (eg, hemorrhage, tumor) or severe, generalized edema (eg, traumatic brain injury) develops.  As a result, portions of the #brain# may #protrude# through the #openings in the dural folds#, often according to the following #herniation# patterns: $Subfalcine: herniation of the cingulate gyrus under the falx cerebri $Uncal: herniation of the medial temporal lobe (ie, uncus) through the tentorial notch $Tonsillar: herniation of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum $This patient with compression of the anterior medial temporal lobe against the free margin of the tentorium cerebelli has #uncal herniation#.  As uncal herniation progresses, the following may occur: $#Ipsilateral oculomotor nerve# (CN III) compression leads to an #ipsilateral fixed and dilated pupil#.  Paralysis of the oculomotor muscles occurs later and leads to ptosis and a down-and-out position of the ipsilateral eye. $Ipsilateral posterior cerebral artery compression leads to #contralateral homonymous hemianopsia# with macular sparing. $Compression of the #ipsilateral cerebral peduncle# of the midbrain against the tentorium may occur, damaging descending corticospinal tracts and causing #contralateral hemiparesis#. $As the midbrain is pushed toward the contralateral side, the contralateral cerebral peduncle may also become compressed against the tentorium, causing ipsilateral hemiparesis (false localizing sign). $Without prompt treatment, further pressure on the midbrain can cause downward brainstem displacement (eg, central herniation) and brainstem hemorrhages (ie, Duret hemorrhages) from stretching and rupture of paramedian branches of the basilar artery.  This is usually fatal. $#(Choices A, B, D, E, F, and G)#  None of the other cranial nerves become compressed due to uncal herniation. $#Educational objective# Uncal herniation is a possible complication of an expanding ipsilateral mass lesion (eg, hemorrhage, tumor).

Cysts and other anomalies are noted in different organs.  Intracranial berry aneurysms arise in the circle of Willis, and when these aneurysms rupture they cause subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).  The clinical presentation described in this question is suggestive of SAH.  Patients complain of a severe headache ('the worst headache of their life'); neck stiffness is usually present or develops in the next 24 hours as blood in the subarachnoid space acts as a meningeal irritant.  Papilledema and pupillary dilation may be noted, but there are no focal neurologic findings. $CT scan of the brain without contrast is the most commonly used initial imaging study for diagnosing SAH and should be done during the first 24 hours from the onset of symptoms.  This is positive in up to 90% of patients.  If the CT scan does not show SAH, but the clinical suspicion remains high, a lumbar puncture needs to be performed to evaluate the cerebrospinal fluid for the presence of xanthochromia (blood in the CSF).  Thus, presence of the xanthochromia in a clinical scenario suggestive of SAH is the most sensitive test for diagnosing SAH. $#(Choice A)#  The classic presentation of meningitis includes fever, headache, neck stiffness, photophobia, nausea, vomiting, and signs of cerebral dysfunction (eg, lethargy, confusion, and coma).  Additionally, remember to look for clues leading you to the correct answer.  For example, the question writer here mentioned that this patient has ADPKD for a reason, to lead you to SAH. $#(Choice B)#  Migraine headache is throbbing or pulsatile.  It is initially unilateral and localized in the frontotemporal and ocular area, then progresses posteriorly and becomes diffuse.  It typically lasts from several hours to an entire day. $#(Choice C)#  Intracerebral hemorrhage manifests with headache, vomiting and sudden onset of focal neurological deficits (hemiplegia, hemianesthesia, cranial nerve deficits, aphasia etc).  Focal neurologic manifestations are unusual with SAH. $#(Choice E)# An elderly male with scalp tenderness over the temporal area (or headache), blurred vision and intermittent claudication of jaw is a typical presentation of temporal arteritis.  This condition is also accompanied by a very high ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and many times occurs in the setting of polymyalgia rheumatica.  Rapid treatment with corticosteroids is necessary to prevent potential blindness. $#(Choice F)#  Cluster headache consists of recurrent brief attacks of sudden, severe, unilateral periorbital pain associated with ipsilateral rhinorrhea, and watering of the eyes. $#Educational objective# Intracranial berry aneurysms of the circle of Willis are often seen in patients with ADPKD; when ruptured, they cause subarachnoid hemorrhage that presents with sudden onset of \"thunderclap headache\".

Acetylcholine binding normally opens these ligand-gated sodium channels, and the subsequent influx of sodium ions raises endplate potential.  To produce a self-propagating muscle action potential, there must be enough activated acetylcholine receptors to allow the endplate potential to reach threshold.  In MG, @antibody binding@ leads to receptor degradation and complement-mediated damage of the postsynaptic membrane, preventing action potentials from being triggered. $Patients commonly have #fluctuating weakness# that worsens throughout the day and most often involves the #extraocular# (eg, ptosis, diplopia) and bulbar (eg, fatigable chewing, dysphagia) muscles.  Ptosis can increase when the patient sustains an upward gaze, and electrophysiologic studies may demonstrate decreasing force of muscle contraction with repetitive stimulation.  Most patients have thymic abnormalities (eg, #thymoma#, thymic hyperplasia) that may appear as an #anterior mediastinal mass# on chest imaging. $#(Choice B)#  @Lambert-Eaton syndrome@ is caused by autoantibodies directed against the presynaptic calcium channel, which causes reduced acetylcholine release.  Patients usually have proximal extremity weakness that improves with muscle use, as opposed to the fatigable weakness of extraocular and bulbar muscles common in MG.  In addition, hyporeflexia (vs normal reflexes) is typically present. $#(Choice C)#  @Guillain-Barré syndrome@ is caused by segmental demyelination of peripheral nerves by infiltrating T lymphocytes (CD8+) and autoantibody formation.  Patients with this acute inflammatory polyneuropathy can have ocular muscle weakness; however, symmetric ascending muscle weakness is classic, and symptoms typically progress rapidly over hours to days (vs months). $#(Choice D)#  Polymyositis is an autoimmune disease that occurs due to CD8+ lymphocyte–mediated skeletal muscle damage.  It usually presents with symmetric proximal muscle weakness (eg, hip flexors) rather than extraocular muscle weakness. $#(Choice E)#  Vascular deposition of @circulating immune complexes@—as may occur in connective tissue disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis—can cause inflammation of blood vessel walls (vasculitis) and a wide range of symptoms.  Muscle weakness can occur but is unlikely to be isolated to extraocular muscles or fluctuate over the course of the day. $#Educational objective# Myasthenia gravis is caused by circulating antibodies directed against acetylcholine receptors of the neuromuscular junction.

  "explanation_2": "$This #elderly# patient likely has recurrent lobar hemorrhage due to #cerebral amyloid angiopathy#.  Amyloid angiopathy is a consequence of β-amyloid deposition in the walls of small- to medium-sized cerebral arteries, resulting in vessel wall weakening and predisposition to rupture.  The disease is not associated with systemic amyloidoses; rather, the amyloidogenic proteins are usually the same as those seen in Alzheimer disease.  Amyloid angiopathy is the most common cause of spontaneous #lobar hemorrhage#, particularly in adults age >60.  Hemorrhage tends to be recurrent and most often involves the @occipital@ and parietal lobes.  Occipital lobe hemorrhage is typically associated with homonymous hemianopsia; parietal hemorrhages can cause contralateral hemisensory loss.  Frontal lobe hemorrhage is less common but may result in contralateral hemiparesis. $#(Choice A)#  Brain @arteriovenous malformation@ is the most common cause of intracranial hemorrhage in children and tends to be a single lesion.  This patient's older age and multifocal hemorrhages make the diagnosis less likely. $#(Choices B and C)#  Carotid artery atherosclerosis and cardiac embolism may cause acute ischemic stroke, which typically presents with sudden neurologic deficits that are maximal at symptom onset.  Embolic stroke can present with multiple infarcts involving the cerebral cortex and has a higher likelihood of spontaneous hemorrhagic transformation.  However, hemorrhagic transformation would be rare within hours of symptom onset.  In addition, this patient's gradually worsening symptoms are more consistent with hemorrhagic stroke. $#(Choice E)#  Charcot-Bouchard aneurysm rupture is usually due to chronic hypertension and typically causes hemorrhage involving deep brain structures (eg, @basal ganglia@, cerebellar nuclei, thalamus, pons).  This patient's recurrent lobar hemorrhages make this less likely. $#(Choice F)#  Hypertensive encephalopathy is characterized by #progressive# headache and nausea/vomiting followed by nonlocalizing neurologic symptoms (eg, confusion).  This patient's focal neurologic deficits and evidence of hemorrhage on neuroimaging exclude this diagnosis. $#(Choice G)#  Hypoxic encephalopathy occurs from global interruption of the cerebral blood supply (eg, due to cardiac arrest).  It most often presents with decreased consciousness (eg, coma, vegetative state) as opposed to focal neurologic deficits with lobar hemorrhage. $#(Choice H)#  Saccular aneurysm rupture is typically associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage as opposed to intraparenchymal hematoma.  Patients usually have an abrupt onset of severe headache (thunderclap headache), and focal neurologic deficits are less common.  On CT, @subarachnoid hemorrhage@ appears as hyperattenuation of the sulci and basal cisterns. $#Educational objective# Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is the most common cause of spontaneous lobar hemorrhage, particularly in the elderly.

When neurons are injured, they undergo distinct histopathologic changes depending on the @type of underlying injury@. $In response to an #acute irreversible injury# (eg, severe hypoglycemia, #ischemia#), neurons begin to display characteristic morphologic changes 12-24 hours after the inciting event, appearing as shrunken cells separated from the surrounding tissue.  The #nucleus# becomes #pyknotic# (shrunken and basophilic with loss of the nucleolus), and the basophilic #Nissl bodies disappear#, resulting in cytoplasm that stains deeply eosinophilic #(red neurons)#. $In the brain, in contrast to most other tissues, ischemia ultimately results in liquefactive necrosis due to the breakdown of neural architecture by hydrolytic enzymes released from reacting inflammatory cells and damaged neurons.  The necrotic neuronal remnants are then phagocytized by microglia, and astrocytes proliferate at the site of the injury to form a glial scar. $#(Choice A)#  Several neurodegenerative diseases (eg, Alzheimer disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration) are characterized by intracellular and/or extracellular accumulation of abnormal proteins in neural tissue.

However, red neuron changes are not characteristic of age-related physiologic changes. $#(Choice C)#  Lysosomal storage diseases (eg, Tay-Sachs, @Niemann-Pick@) cause the accumulation of improperly digested substances in lysosomes, leading to neural degeneration through free radical damage and apoptosis.  Expected histopathologic changes include enlarged neuronal cells with a foamy appearance due to accumulated undigested macromolecules. $#(Choice E)#  Extensive axon damage or transection results in an axonal reaction characterized by cell body swelling, movement of the nucleus to the periphery, and dispersion of Nissl bodies.  This response occurs due to increased protein and lipid synthesis during axon regeneration. $#(Choice F)#  Transient neural compression can lead to a temporary loss of function due to ischemia but would not lead to significant histopathologic changes unless the compression was sustained.  Neural compression may occur in the CNS due to increased intracranial pressure or a mass lesion. $#Educational objective# Neurons that sustain irreversible ischemic injury begin to develop characteristic histopathologic changes 12-24 hours after the inciting event.

Also called acoustic neuromas, they typically cause #hearing loss#, tinnitus, and/or imbalance (true vertigo is uncommon).  #Bilateral# VS are the hallmark of #neurofibromatosis type 2# (NF2). $NF2 is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the #NF2# gene on #chromosome 22# that encodes for merlin, a tumor suppressor protein associated with the plasma membrane.  Because merlin is expressed primarily in neural cells, loss of function results in multiple #nervous system tumors#.  Schwann cells are most susceptible, giving rise to the most common tumor (schwannoma), and merlin's alternative name (schwannomin). $Patients with NF2 can also develop schwannomas affecting other cranial and spinal nerves; central nervous system ependymomas and meningiomas also occur with increased frequency. $#(Choice A)#  Mutations of the NF1 tumor suppressor gene (chromosome 17) cause @neurofibromatosis type 1@ (NF1).  Although NF1 can have CNS involvement (eg, optic pathway gliomas), bilateral VS are not characteristic.  In addition, cutaneous manifestations (eg, café-au-lait macules) are more common, and the peripheral nerve tumors of NF1 are neurofibromas (not schwannomas). $#(Choice C)#  Mutations of the RB1 tumor suppressor gene (chromosome 13) increase the risk for @retinoblastoma@ and @osteosarcoma@. $#(Choice D)#  Mutations affecting the TP53 gene (codes for p53) on chromosome 17 are the most commonly acquired mutations in cancer.  Inherited mutations cause the rare cancer-predisposing Li-Fraumeni syndrome (eg, breast cancer, sarcomas).  Although affected patients frequently develop brain tumors at a young age, bilateral VS are much more suggestive of schwannomatosis (eg, NF2). $#(Choice E)#  Mutation of the TSC1 tumor suppressor gene (chromosome 9) or TSC2 (chromosome 16) leads to tuberous sclerosis complex, an inherited neurocutaneous disorder that can cause brain tumors.  However, these are typically periventricular (@subependymal nodules@) and associated with multisystemic findings, including skin (eg, @facial angiofibromas@, @ash-leaf macules@), eye, and heart manifestations. $#(Choice F)#  Mutation of the VHL tumor suppressor gene (chromosome 3) causes von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease.  Although VHL can cause cerebellopontine angle masses (endolymphatic sac tumors), other CNS (eg, hemangioblastomas) and visceral (eg, clear renal carcinomas, pheochromocytomas) tumors are common. $#Educational objective# Bilateral vestibular schwannomas are the hallmark of neurofibromatosis type 2, a dominantly inherited disorder caused by mutations of the NF2 gene on chromosome 22.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient's history of recurrent fever and abdominal pain with imaging findings consistent with renal scarring (eg. dilated calyces with overlying cortical atrophy) is indicative of #recurrent pyelonephritis#.  Pyelonephritis results from #retrograde flow# of bacteria in the bladder into the ureter, where they can then ascend unimpeded to the kidney. $Normally, the ureters travel through the bladder wall at an oblique angle.  When the bladder fills, the intramural ureter becomes compressed, and this flap-valve mechanism prevents retrograde flow of urine.  However, this mechanism does not work correctly if the ureter enters the bladder wall at a more perpendicular angle, leading to #vesicoureteral reflux# (VUR). $Patients with VUR are at much higher risk for chronic pyelonephritis.  Renal inflammation can occur from pyelonephritis and also from VUR itself due to increased hydrostatic pressure on the papillae.  Ongoing injury leads to #renal scarring#, most commonly at the upper and lower poles of the kidney in which compound papillae are found.  Compound papillae are always open, unlike simple papillae in the mid-kidney, and are therefore more susceptible to dilation and subsequent injury.  If uncorrected, chronic VUR can lead to reflux nephropathy and #secondary hypertension#. $#(Choice A)#  Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease generally presents in adulthood with hematuria, hypertension, and renal insufficiency.  Symptomatic patients have nephromegaly and diffuse parenchymal cysts on ultrasonography. $#(Choice B)#  Malignant hypertension refers to very high blood pressure that develops rapidly and causes end-organ damage.  Affected patients can have vision changes, encephalopathy, and renal failure.  This patient has no evidence of acute end-organ dysfunction, and her imaging is more consistent with VUR and chronic pyelonephritis. $#(Choice C)#  Multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) is a nonhereditary renal malformation characterized by multiple noncommunicating cysts with intervening dysplastic tissue.  Unilateral MCDK may be clinically silent, but bilateral MCDK presents with early, severe renal insufficiency due to the absence of functional renal tissue. $#(Choice D)#  @Posterior urethral valves@ can present with bilateral hydronephrosis and calyceal dilation due to obstruction of urine flow in the urethra.  However, posterior urethral valves result from a malformation of the wolffian duct and therefore only occur in male patients. $#Educational objective# Vesicoureteral reflux is characterized by retrograde urine flow from the bladder into the ureter.

  "explanation_2": "This patient on long-term hemodialysis has carpal tunnel syndrome and shoulder pain/hypertrophy, most likely due to #dialysis-related amyloidosis# (DRA). $Amyloidosis is a group of multisystem disorders, all characterized by #misfolded proteins#.  Misfolding results from increased production, decreased clearance, inherited mutations, or age-related deposition of protein subunits.  Structural transformation of precursor proteins into #beta-pleated sheets# leads to aggregation and polymerization into amyloid fibrils.  Resistant to degradation, amyloid #accumulates in extracellular tissues#, causing organ dysfunction.  Each precursor protein generates specific amyloid fibrils predisposed to particular organs. $In DRA, #beta2-microglobulin# (beta2-m) is the precursor protein and a component of major histocompatibility class I molecules on all nucleated cells.  Continuously shed in plasma, beta2-m has near-total clearance by normal kidneys.  However, in end-stage renal failure, it is #inadequately eliminated despite dialysis# and deposited in tissue as beta2-m amyloid.  Disease most often involves #osteoarticular structures# as connective tissue components (eg, glycosaminoglycans, type-1 collagen) stabilize beta2-m amyloid fibrils and inhibit their depolymerization.  Typical manifestations include: $• Scapulohumeral periarthritis (pain/hypertrophy from rotator cuff infiltration) $• Carpal tunnel syndrome (@median neuropathy@ from carpal tunnel deposition) $• Flexor tenosynovitis (contractures from involvement of flexor tendons) $• Bone cysts (possible pathologic fractures) $DRA prevalence increases with age and dialysis duration.  Although improved dialysis membranes provide better clearance of beta2-m, its prevalence remains significant. $#(Choice A)#  Free immunoglobulin light chains are produced in excess by clonal expansion of plasma cells in multiple myeloma and deposited as AL amyloid.  AL amyloid typically results in nephrotic syndrome, hepatomegaly, restrictive cardiomyopathy, and neuropathy.  Macroglossia and periorbital purpura are less common but characteristic. $#(Choice B)#  Serum amyloid A is an acute phase protein excessively produced due to elevated cytokines in chronic infectious or inflammatory conditions (eg, tuberculosis, rheumatoid arthritis).  Accumulation produces AA amyloid, which deposits primarily in the kidneys, liver, and spleen.  This patient has no chronic infectious or inflammatory conditions. $#(Choices D and E)#  Transthyretin is a protein named for its function (transports thyroxin and retinol).  Inherited mutation or age can cause its deposition as amyloid with prominent cardiac involvement. $#Educational objective#: Beta2-microglobulin is renally cleared and poorly dialyzed.  It accumulates as amyloid in dialysis patients, increasing in prevalence with dialysis duration, and has a predilection for osteoarticular surfaces.  Shoulder pain and carpal tunnel syndrome are common.  Bone cysts and pathologic fractures may also occur. ",

The #increased PO4# binds free serum Ca2+, resulting in #hypocalcemia#.  Loss of normal renal parenchyma reduces 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D synthesis, resulting in a significant decline in intestinal Ca2+ absorption and Ca2+ release from bone.  This further exacerbates the hypocalcemia, which along with hyperphosphatemia and low calcitriol, stimulates PTH production (#secondary hyperparathyroidism#). $#(Choice B)#  In primary hyperparathyroidism, serum Ca2+ is elevated but does not suppress PTH due to autonomous gland function.  In longstanding CKD, PTH release may become independent of Ca2+ levels due to chronic parathyroid cell stimulation; PTH remains elevated despite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and Ca2+ supplementation (#tertiary hyperparathyroidism#).  However, this is less common than secondary hyperparathyroidism and is usually seen in patients with end-stage renal disease (ie, on dialysis). $#(Choice C)#  Calcitriol and Ca2+ supplementation in patients with CKD often returns PTH and Ca2+ levels to normal. $#(Choice D)#  Low PTH with hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia is seen in hypoparathyroidism. $#(Choice E)#  High serum Ca2+ with low PTH is seen in patients with PTH-independent causes of hypercalcemia, which include hypercalcemia of malignancy, vitamin D toxicity, excessive Ca2+ ingestion, thyrotoxicosis, and immobilization (Ca2+ resorbed from inactive bones). $#Educational objective# Chronic kidney disease usually causes hyperphosphatemia (binds serum Ca2+) and low 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (decreases intestinal Ca2+ absorption and Ca2+ release from bone).

  "explanation_2": "This patient with a vasopressin-2 (V2) receptor mutation has polyuria and hypernatremia, findings which are consistent with congenital #nephrogenic diabetes insipidus# (DI). $#V2 receptors# are located in the renal cortical collecting ducts.  When serum osmolality rises (eg, water deprivation, dehydration), there is increased release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH, vasopressin) which activates V2 receptors to reabsorb water into the systemic circulation.  Water reabsorption leads to concentrated urine (low urinary volume, high urine osmolality) and lower serum osmolality. $#Mutations #that impair normal V2 receptor function result in nephrogenic DI (#ADH resistance#).  Following water deprivation, the collecting ducts are unable to reabsorb water despite high circulating ADH levels, leading to ongoing urinary water losses.  Therefore, nephrogenic DI manifests with large volumes of abnormally #dilute urine# (ie, polyuria with low urine osmolality), #high serum osmolality# (ie, hypernatremia), and dehydration. $High serum osmolality, polyuria, and dilute urine also occur in central DI, which is caused by deficient ADH production by the hypothalamus.  As with nephrogenic DI, urine remains abnormally dilute after water deprivation.  However, #challenge with desmopressin# (an analogue of ADH) can differentiate between central and nephrogenic DI: $In nephrogenic DI, desmopressin cannot correct the underlying ADH resistance.  Therefore, #urine osmolality remains unchanged# (eg, low). $In #central DI#, desmopressin corrects the underlying ADH deficiency.  Therefore, #urine osmolality increases# following administration #(choice C)#. $#(Choice B)#  High baseline serum osmolality and high urine osmolality can be seen in states of marked hyperglycemia with glucosuria (ie, solute diuresis).  Although polyuria can occur, the ADH response remains intact, so urine osmolality will be high with water deprivation. $#(Choice D) # Primary polydipsia can also result in polyuria with dilute urine.  However, unlike DI, serum osmolality and sodium are low (due to excess water intake), and dilute urine represents an appropriate physiologic response.  ADH response is intact, so urine osmolality is appropriately high following water deprivation.  No additional change is seen with desmopressin because maximum ADH levels are reached with water deprivation. $#(Choices E and F)#  This patient has visible signs of dehydration and hypernatremia; because sodium is a major determinant of serum osmolality, a high serum osmolality is expected. $#Educational objective# Vasopressin-2 receptor mutations are a cause of congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, a condition in which renal resistance to antidiuretic hormone results in excessive urinary water losses.

  "explanation_2": "$#Parathyroid hormone# (PTH) plays an important role in bone remodeling by regulating the activity of osteoblasts (which secrete osteoid for bone formation) and osteoclasts (which resorb bone).  PTH exerts the following #dual effects# on bone: $• Increases #bone formation# by stimulating the differentiation and activity of osteoblasts $• Increases #bone resorption# by transforming osteoblasts into osteoclasts $This balanced process allows for normal bone turnover but can become disrupted in conditions that alter PTH secretion, such as @secondary hyperparathyroidism@ in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).  In CKD, hypocalcemia, caused by decreased formation of active vitamin D and decreased renal phosphate excretion, triggers #PTH secretion# in an attempt to increase serum calcium.  Despite releasing calcium from bones, this compensatory response is unable to fully normalize serum calcium (due to the failing kidneys) and therefore results in chronic PTH elevation (ie, @loss of negative feedback@). $Chronic PTH elevation leads to increased activity of both osteoclasts and osteoblasts; the increase in osteoclast activity exceeds that of osteoblasts, which results in #greater bone resorption than formation# (suggested by an elevated serum alkaline phosphatase).  A potential consequence of this high bone turnover is #osteitis fibrosa cystica#, a form of renal osteodystrophy characterized by weakened bone caused by the replacement of mineralized bone with fibrous tissue. $Serum elevations in PTH, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase, in conjunction with the plain radiography finding of #subperiosteal resorption#, are typically sufficient for the diagnosis of osteitis fibrosa cystica.  However, a bone biopsy would show an #increased# number of #osteoclasts and osteoblasts# throughout the bone trabeculae #(choice D)#. $#(Choice A)#  Excessive treatment of hyperparathyroidism can lead to chronically low PTH levels, which can cause adynamic bone disease.  Adynamic bone disease is another form of renal osteodystrophy characterized by a low bone turnover state with decreased cellularity (ie, decreased numbers of both osteoblasts and osteoclasts). $#(Choice B)#  The combination of decreased osteoclasts and increased osteoblasts is rarely seen in bone disease. $#Educational objective #Osteitis fibrosa cystica is a form of renal osteodystrophy characterized by abnormally high bone turnover caused by chronic parathyroid hormone stimulation of osteoclasts to a greater degree than that of osteoblasts.  Bone biopsy would show an increased number of both osteoclasts and osteoblasts. ",

SLE is an autoimmune disease that occurs due to the formation of autoantibodies against cell surface and nuclear antigens.

This commonly causes tachycardia, tremor, and palpitations but would not cause aneurysm formation. $#Educational objective# Fibromuscular dysplasia is characterized by abnormal tissue growth within arterial walls, resulting in stenotic and tortuous arteries that can cause tissue ischemia and are prone to aneurysm formation.  Pathology typically demonstrates alternating fibromuscular webs and aneurysmal dilation with absent internal elastic lamina (string-of-beads appearance).  Renovascular hypertension occurs due to renal artery stenosis and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. "

His evaluation shows multiple round lung lesions with microscopy revealing @rounded polygonal cells@ with #abundant clear cytoplasm#.

The cytoplasm appears clear due to the high glycogen and lipid content of the tumor.  For the same reason, this neoplasm is often golden-yellow on macroscopic examination. $Patients with RCC are often asymptomatic; the classic triad of hematuria, flank pain, and palpable abdominal mass occur together in less than 10% of cases, often late in the course of the disease.  #Nonspecific symptoms# such as fever and weight loss are more common.  Paraneoplastic syndromes, including polycythemia (constitutive secretion of erythropoietin) and hypercalcemia (synthesis of parathyroid hormone-related protein), can also occur. $Renal cell carcinoma is often #detected incidentally# since localizing symptoms only develop in advanced disease; metastases are often discovered earlier than the primary neoplasm.

These antibodies promote inflammatory injury of the glomerular and alveolar basement membranes, resulting in rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and alveolar hemorrhage, respectively. $#Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis# results in nephritic syndrome, characterized by hypertension, edema, acute renal failure, hematuria (eg, dysmorphic red cells and red cell casts), and proteinuria.

  "explanation_2": "$  This patient has progressive lower urinary tract symptoms, likely due to #benign prostatic hyperplasia# (BPH).  BPH is common in older men and is characterized by a combination of epithelial and stromal hyperplasia, predominantly in the periurethral and transition zones.  On palpation, the prostate has a rubbery consistency, in contrast to prostate cancer, in which the gland is nodular and very firm. $As the prostate enlarges it impinges on the prostatic urethra, causing progressively worsening #bladder outlet obstruction#.  This leads to problems voiding (eg, hesitancy, straining, weak urinary stream) and impaired urine storage (eg, daytime frequency, urgency, nocturia).  As BPH progresses, incomplete bladder emptying leads to overflow incontinence (involuntary urine spillage from an overly full bladder).  #Increased hydrostatic force# is needed to overcome the obstruction, causing hypertrophy of the bladder wall musculature and dilation of the ureters, renal pelvis, and calyces (#hydronephrosis#).  If left untreated, urinary reflux can lead to significant pressure-induced #parenchymal atrophy# with scarring and eventual #chronic kidney disease#. $#(Choice A)#  Glomerular sclerosis and hyalinosis are typical of diabetic nephrosclerosis and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS).  Diabetes can cause autonomic neuropathy with overflow incontinence, but it is rare and typically occurs in poorly controlled chronic diabetes.  FSGS does not cause lower urinary tract symptoms. $#(Choice B)#  Hyperplastic arteriolar changes are seen in severe (malignant) hypertension.  Hypertension does not cause lower urinary tract symptoms.  Additionally, this patient does not have a history of high blood pressure or symptoms associated with malignant hypertension (eg, headache, blurred vision). $#(Choice C)#  Ischemic tubular necrosis results from decreased renal perfusion (eg, sepsis, hemorrhage, heart failure).  Patients develop oliguria, azotemia (elevated blood levels of nitrogenous wastes), elevated serum creatinine, and electrolyte disturbances. $#(Choice E)#  Epithelial dysplasia (eg, alterations in cell shape and size, nuclei size, and staining) is considered a precursor of malignancy.  BPH does not predispose to renal tubular dysplasia or prostate cancer. $#Educational objective# Benign prostatic hyperplasia leads to progressive bladder outlet obstruction.  Over time, increased urinary pressures can cause hydronephrosis and renal parenchymal atrophy with scarring.  This can progress to chronic kidney disease. "

In chronic cases, collateral venous circulation may develop based on the site of the obstruction.  Prominent abdominal wall #collateral veins#, as in this patient, suggest obstruction of the upper segment of the IVC. $#(Choices A, B, and E)#  The femoral, iliac, and saphenous veins are too low in the legs to produce significant abdominal wall collateral veins if obstructed.  Obstruction of these veins would be more likely to cause varices on the legs, thighs, and hips.  In addition, unilateral (rather than bilateral) lower extremity edema would be expected. $#(Choice D)#  Obstruction of the portal vein is most commonly associated with severe hepatic cirrhosis.  Affected patients have shunting of blood through portocaval anastomoses, leading to hemorrhoids, esophageal varices, and caput medusae about the umbilicus.  They may also have ascites. $#Educational objective# Renal cell carcinoma tends to invade the renal vein; inferior vena cava obstruction can occur by intraluminal extension of the tumor.  Obstruction of the inferior vena cava produces symmetric bilateral lower extremity edema, often associated with prominent development of venous collaterals in the abdominal wall. "

  "explanation_2": "$This patient's presentation is consistent with #metabolic bone disease# due to chronic kidney disease (CKD).  CKD decreases the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which decreases the filtered phosphate load and causes #elevated serum phosphate levels#.  Hyperphosphatemia reduces serum free calcium and stimulates osteocytes and osteoclasts to release fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23), a circulating peptide that decreases proximal tubule phosphate reabsorption.  Elevated levels of phosphate and FGF-23 also #reduce calcitriol synthesis# by inhibiting the proximal tubular expression of 1-alpha-hydroxylase, resulting in decreased intestinal calcium and phosphate absorption.  This worsens hypocalcemia but does not significantly improve hyperphosphatemia due to the low GFR, which is the limiting factor for phosphate excretion in patients with advanced CKD. $Hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia also #increase parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion#, which stimulates osteoclasts to increase bone turnover.  Long-term elevation in PTH (secondary hyperparathyroidism) can eventually lead to friable bones and #osteitis fibrosa#.  Affected patients can develop weakness, #bone pain#, and fractures. $#(Choice A)#  Primary hyperparathyroidism causes hypercalcemia and decreased serum phosphate due to inappropriately elevated PTH.  Renal synthesis of calcitriol is also increased by PTH.  In contrast, calcitriol levels remain low in patients with CKD due to the reduction in renal mass and the inhibitory effects of FGF-23 and phosphate. $#(Choice B)#  Vitamin D toxicity raises calcitriol levels, which increases calcium and phosphate absorption causing hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia.  Hypercalcemia inhibits PTH release, lowering serum PTH. $#(Choice D)#  Vitamin D deficiency in patients with normally functioning kidneys decreases intestinal calcium and phosphate absorption, leading to lower serum phosphate and calcium levels.  The resulting hypocalcemia stimulates PTH release from the parathyroid glands. $#(Choice E)#  Primary hypoparathyroidism causes hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia due to decreased PTH.

  "explanation_2": "$This child most likely has minimal change disease, the most common cause of #nephrotic syndrome# in children.  It typically presents suddenly after an upper respiratory infection.  The classic features of nephrotic syndrome are #heavy proteinuria# (>3.5 g/day in adults and >50 mg/kg/day in children), #hypoalbuminemia# (<3 g/dL), #generalized edema#, and #hyperlipidemia#.  Two mechanisms, @underfilling and overfilling@, contribute to the pathogenesis of edema in nephrotic syndrome.  The underfilling mechanism is particularly significant in minimal change disease in children and presents as follows: $#1. Increased glomerular capillary permeability# to plasma proteins leads to massive #loss of protein# (predominantly albumin) in the urine. $2. The large decrease in serum albumin causes a #drop in intravascular oncotic pressure#, which results in fluid moving into the interstitial space and edema formation #(choice C)#. $3. The fluid shift results in intravascular volume depletion (ie, underfilling), which triggers the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system to increase aldosterone synthesis (secondary hyperaldosteronism) and antidiuretic hormone secretion #(choice B)#.  The result is intravascular #sodium and water retention (Choice E)#.  This fluid leaks back out into the interstitial space due to the low oncotic pressure, exacerbating the edema. $4. Low intravascular oncotic pressure stimulates #increased lipoprotein production# in the liver.  Impaired lipid catabolism due to decreased lipoprotein lipase and abnormal transport of circulating lipid particles also contributes to hyperlipidemia. $#(Choice A)#  When the serum albumin level decreases due to its massive loss in the urine, the liver responds by increasing albumin synthesis.  However, the amount of renal albumin loss exceeds the liver synthetic capacity. $#Educational objective# Minimal change disease is the most common childhood nephrotic syndrome.  Increased glomerular capillary permeability causes massive protein (eg, albumin) loss in the urine.  Hypoalbuminemia reduces plasma oncotic pressure, which causes a fluid shift into the interstitial space, resulting in edema.  Low oncotic pressure also triggers increased lipoprotein production in the liver (ie, hyperlipidemia). ",

This presentation suggests #minimal change disease# (MCD), the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in #young children#.  MCD is often idiopathic but can occur after an inciting event, including respiratory infections, immunizations, or insect sting/bite.  Subsequent T-cell dysfunction leads to the production of a glomerular permeability factor (possibly IL-13) which damages podocytes and decreases the anionic properties of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM).  Loss of negative charge results in the selective loss of albumin in the urine, which causes hypoalbuminemia and edema. $Most children with MCD can be diagnosed presumptively based on clinical presentation, and renal biopsy is usually unnecessary.  If biopsy is performed, @light microscopy@ (LM) shows #normal glomeruli#, and #no immunoglobulin# or complement deposits are seen with immunofluorescent staining.

These stones are large and radio-opaque, and typically present with fever and moderate flank pain. $#(Choice E)#  Hyperparathyroidism leads to hypercalcemia and an increased filtered calcium load.  The subsequent hypercalciuria increases the risk of radio-opaque calcium (oxalate, phosphate) stones. $#Educational objective# Formation of uric acid kidney stones is promoted by low urine pH, which favors formation of insoluble uric acid over soluble urate ion.

Patients initially have symptoms of ethanol intoxication; signs of acute renal failure (oliguria, flank pain) develop approximately 24-72 hours after ingestion.  Ethylene glycol itself is relatively nontoxic; however, it is metabolized to glycolic acid and oxalic acid, resulting in its various toxicities. $Acute kidney injury occurs due to both glycolic acid, which causes #direct tubular cytotoxicity#, and oxalic acid, which crystalizes and causes tubular obstruction.

It also typically occurs in older patients and presents with hypercalcemia and anemia; altered mentation is unexpected. $#(Choice C)#  Hyperparathyroidism causes hypercalcemia, which predisposes patients to calcium stone (eg, calcium oxalate) formation.

  "explanation_2": "$#Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease# (ADPKD), like many autosomal dominant diseases, #manifests later in life# (eg, age 40-50).  Microscopic cysts are present at birth but are too small to be detected by abdominal ultrasound.  Over the years, the cysts enlarge, compression of the renal parenchyma occurs, and patients become symptomatic (eg, flank pain, hypertension). $In contrast, autosomal #recessive# polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) #presents at birth# or during the first year of life with bilateral flank masses.  Cysts are formed by dilated distal tubules and collecting ducts.  Abdominal ultrasonography demonstrates enlarged kidneys at birth and often shows @cysts@, which are visualized if they are >1 cm in diameter #(Choice B)#. $#(Choice C)#  The abnormal fusion of kidneys at their poles (usually the lower poles) is called @horseshoe kidney@.  The isthmus of renal tissue is anterior to the great vessels and is easily detected on abdominal ultrasound. $#(Choice D)#  Multicystic dysplastic kidney is characterized by the presence of multiple renal cysts of varying sizes and the absence of a normal pelvicalyceal system.  The condition is associated with ureteral or ureteropelvic atresia, with the affected kidney essentially rendered nonfunctional.  Abdominal ultrasound of the fetus or newborn is typically diagnostic. $#(Choice E)#  A number of fetal renal abnormalities (eg, bilateral renal agenesis, ARPKD) can cause a decrease in fetal urine production and oligohydramnios.  The combination of abnormalities that ensues, called @Potter sequence@, includes pulmonary hypoplasia, Potter facies (flattened nose, recessed chin, prominent epicanthal folds, and low-set ears), limb deformities, and cardiovascular abnormalities.  Renal defects that lead to Potter sequence are usually profound and easily seen on ultrasound. $#Educational objective# Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease typically manifests in patients age 40-50 with enlarged kidneys, flank pain, and hypertension.  In newborns, the kidneys are of normal size, and the cysts are too small to be detected on abdominal ultrasonography.  As the cysts enlarge, they compress the renal parenchyma and cause symptoms. ",

  "explanation_2": "This patient's biopsy findings are consistent with #hypertensive nephrosclerosis# (HN), a complication of chronic hypertension that is most common in elderly patients.  Prolonged elevation of systemic blood pressure causes the renal arterioles to undergo compensatory #medial hypertrophy# and #fibrointimal proliferation#.  Endothelial damage leads to deposition of plasma proteins and basement membrane material in the arteriolar walls (#hyaline arteriolosclerosis#).  The resultant lumenal narrowing restricts renal blood flow, resulting in glomerular ischemia and fibrosis (#glomerulosclerosis#) with collapse of the capillary loops and thickening of the Bowman capsule.  Gross examination of affected kidneys shows mild #renal atrophy# with a finely granular surface. $HN generally progresses slowly, and most patients with mild to moderate disease do not develop renal insufficiency.  However, advanced disease occurs more commonly in patients of African American descent and in those with severe hypertension or comorbid diabetes.  Proteinuria is common in advanced disease, but #urinalysis# is otherwise typically #bland# (eg, no casts, red or white blood cells).  Like all chronic kidney diseases, advanced HN can cause #anemia #due to a reduction in renal erythropoietin production. $#(Choice A)#  Analgesic nephropathy can occur with prolonged, excessive nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory use.  However, pathologic findings typically include papillary necrosis and tubulointerstitial nephritis. $#(Choice B)#  Fibromuscular dysplasia causes renal artery stenosis, resulting in refractory hypertension.  However, it typically occurs in younger women (age <50), and histology characteristically shows fibromuscular ridges alternating with areas of aneurysmal dilation affecting the main renal artery. $#(Choice C)#  Hepatitis C infection can cause membranous nephropathy, which presents with nephrotic syndrome (eg, proteinuria, edema).  Histology demonstrates diffuse thickening of the glomerular basement membrane without glomerular hypercellularity. $#(Choice E)#  Multiple myeloma can cause anemia and renal disease, but histology typically demonstrates a light chain cast nephropathy; eosinophilic casts obstruct the renal tubules, resulting in tubular inflammation and fibrosis.  Patients typically also have fatigue, constipation (hypercalcemia), and bone pain (lytic lesions). $#Educational objective# Chronic hypertension can result in hypertensive nephrosclerosis, which is characterized by compensatory medial hypertrophy and fibrointimal proliferation; endothelial damage from elevated systemic pressure also leads to hyaline arteriolosclerosis.  The narrowed arteriolar lumens cause a progressive decrease in renal blood flow, resulting in glomerular ischemia and fibrosis (glomerulosclerosis). "

Patients may also have mild to moderate proteinuria, although typically less severe than in nephrotic syndrome.  Acute kidney injury and hypertension may also be present. $The most common cause of nephritic syndrome is #immune complex deposition#.  Most immune complex–related nephritic syndromes (eg, poststreptococcal or membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, lupus nephritis) are associated with IgG and/or IgM complexes and have heavy glomerular complement deposition and subsequent serum hypocomplementemia (consumption).  However, #IgA nephropathy# is characterized by #normal serum complement levels#, as seen in this patient, likely due to the weak complement-fixing activity of IgA compared to that of IgG and IgM. $IgA nephropathy typically presents with gross, often #recurrent#, hematuria, as in this case.  Although this condition classically presents within several #days of an upper respiratory infection# (synpharyngitic hematuria), a high degree of suspicion must be maintained because episodes may also be #spontaneous#, as in this patient. $#(Choices A, C, and D)#  Nephrotic syndromes cause heavy proteinuria, resulting in low albumin levels and edema; hematuria and red blood cell casts are typically absent.  Etiologies include diabetic nephropathy, membranous nephropathy, and minimal change disease.  Diabetic nephropathy typically takes >5 years to develop in type 1 diabetes, although it can be present at the time of diagnosis in patients with type 2 diabetes. $#(Choice E)#  Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, which is most common in school-aged children, presents with nephritic syndrome several weeks after infection with group A Streptococcus (eg, pharyngitis, impetigo).  This patient has had no recent illnesses, and in contrast to IgA nephropathy, hypocomplementemia would be expected in poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. $#Educational objective# IgA nephropathy is characterized as recurrent hematuria that occurs spontaneously or within a few days of upper respiratory or pharyngeal infection (synpharyngitic hematuria).  Unlike other causes of immune complex–mediated nephritic syndromes (eg, poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis), IgA nephropathy is associated with normal serum complement levels. "

Although GN has many etiologies, the patient's tender and swollen hand joints (#inflammatory arthritis#) and renal biopsy findings are strongly suggestive of underlying #systemic lupus erythematosus#. $An immunofluorescence pattern containing #IgG, IgM, IgA# and #C3, C1q# is highly characteristic of lupus nephritis and is referred to as a #full-house# (ie, a poker hand with three of a kind [3 immunoglobulin classes] and two of a kind [2 complement components]).  The full-house pattern reflects the pathogenesis of lupus: loss of immune tolerance to self-antigens (eg, double-stranded DNA) leads to generation of #polyclonal autoantibodies# that form circulating immune complexes; these deposit in the glomeruli, where they cause local injury by activating the #classical complement #cascade. $Immune complex deposition in the @subendothelial space@ (visible on electron microscopy) allows for direct contact with inflammatory cells (eg, neutrophils), causing glomerular inflammation.

  "explanation_2": "This patient's acute kidney injury (eg, elevated creatinine), proteinuria, hypertension, and glomerular hematuria (eg, #red cell casts#) are indicative of #glomerulonephritis# (GN).  GN is commonly a manifestation of #small vessel vasculitis# (SVV), which usually has associated systemic symptoms (eg, #fever#, fatigue).  GN due to SVV is immune mediated by 3 possible mechanisms: $Antibodies targeting antigens in the glomerulus (intrinsic or deposited) with immune complex (IC) formation in the kidney $Preformed circulating ICs targeting endogenous or exogenous antigens with subsequent kidney deposition $Antibodies targeting neutrophil antigens causing neutrophil activation without significant IC deposition $Several features of this patient's presentation suggest #GN/SVV due to hepatitis C virus# (HCV).  Evidence for HCV infection includes multiple sexual partners and elevated aminotransferases.  HCV-infected patients often produce cryoglobulins against #exogenous# HCV antigens that form #circulating ICs#, which activate complement, causing hypocomplementemia.  These circulating ICs can deposit in small vessels ('cryoglobulinemic vasculitis') affecting the kidney (eg, membranoproliferative GN), skin (eg, palpable purpura), and joints (eg, arthralgias). $#(Choices A and B)#  Antibodies targeting glomerular antigens, whether intrinsic (eg, membranous nephropathy) or deposited (eg, poststreptococcal GN), form ICs within the kidney; this typically results in renal-limited disease.  Anti-GBM disease is an exception because the antibodies are directed against type IV collagen, which is also present in alveoli resulting in alveolar hemorrhage.  This patient's fever, arthralgias, and rash indicate a systemic process characteristic of circulating immune complex deposition. $#(Choice C)#  Antibodies targeting neutrophil antigens (myeloperoxidase, proteinase 3) can activate neutrophils, causing ANCA-associated GN and SVV (without significant IC deposition).  Although the skin and joints can be affected, the respiratory tract and nerves are typically involved, and hypocomplementemia is unusual. $#(Choice D)#  Preformed circulating ICs against endogenous antigens are the cause of IgA nephropathy and lupus nephritis.  IgA nephropathy is more common in children following upper respiratory infections; serum complement is usually normal because IgA fixes complement poorly.  Lupus nephritis is associated with arthralgia, vasculitis, and hypocomplementemia; however, this patient's presentation (eg, male sex, sexual risk factors) is more suggestive of underlying hepatitis C infection. $#Educational objective# Immune glomerular injury results from immune complexes (ICs) or neutrophil activation.  IC formation in the kidney typically produces renal-limited disease (except anti–glomerular basement membrane disease).  Preformed circulating IC deposition is usually associated with small vessel vasculitis and hypocomplementemia. "

  "explanation_img": "",
  "explanation_1": "",
  "explanation_2": "This patient's imaging shows an atrophic left kidney associated with a large, hyperdense mass filling the renal pelvis.  These findings are consistent with a chronic @staghorn calculus@, a type of kidney stone that occurs in patients with recurrent upper urinary tract infection caused by #urease-producing organisms# (eg, Proteus, Klebsiella).  Hydrolysis of urea yields #ammonia#, which #alkalinizes the urine# (ie, pH >7) and facilitates precipitation of @struvite crystals@ (magnesium ammonium phosphate). $Because of the large quantities of urea excreted in urine, struvite stones can #grow rapidly# into a branched staghorn calculus that #fills the renal calyces and pelvis#.  Symptoms are usually related to the underlying infection (eg, fever, mild costovertebral pain, hematuria); renal colic (ie, severe flank/groin pain) is uncommon because large stones are unable to pass into the ureter and cause acute obstruction.  Over time, the affected #kidney can atrophy# due to recurrent infection and chronic obstructive nephropathy. $#(Choice A)#  Trace or weakly positive (eg, 1 or 2+) proteinuria can be seen in a variety of disorders (eg, hematuria due to kidney stones, urinary tract infection) due to disruption of the urothelium; however, a strongly positive result (eg, 3 or 4+) is more specific for glomerular protein loss (eg, amyloidosis, diabetic nephropathy) and is not usually due to stones. $#(Choice B)#  Eosinophiluria is typically associated with acute interstitial nephritis, which is most commonly triggered by exposure to certain medications (eg, beta-lactam antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs).  Patients typically have a rash, fever, and acute kidney injury, but this condition is not associated with staghorn calculi. $#(Choice D)#  Red cell casts and dysmorphic red blood cells form when erythrocytes traverse the renal tubules and indicate a glomerular bleeding source (eg, glomerulonephritis).  Staghorn calculi can cause hematuria with morphologically normal red cells due to irritation of the urothelium, but do not cause glomerular bleeding. $#(Choice E)#  Urine specific gravity correlates with urine concentration and is influenced by hydration status and regulatory hormone (eg, antidiuretic hormone) levels.  Kidney stones most commonly form in concentrated urine (eg, >1.015), which results in supersaturation of salts and crystal precipitation.  A specific gravity of ≤1.003 indicates dilute urine, and it is unlikely that a patient with an acute stone would have such a low specific gravity. $#(Choice F)#  Uric acid stones can occasionally form staghorn calculi but would typically be seen in patients with gout or conditions with rapid cell turnover (eg, myeloproliferative disorders) rather than recurrent urinary tract infection.  This patient is much more likely to have a struvite stone. $#Educational objective# Struvite stones are typically seen in patients with recurrent upper urinary infection by urease-producing organisms (eg, Proteus, Klebsiella).  Hydrolysis of urea yields ammonia, which alkalinizes the urine and facilitates precipitation of magnesium ammonium phosphate.  Urinalysis shows hematuria and elevated urine pH. ",

  "explanation_2": "$Recurrent nephrolithiasis in a young patient should raise suspicion for #cystinuria#, which is confirmed by the pathognomonic finding of #hexagonal-shaped crystals# on urinalysis.  Cystinuria is an autosomal recessive disorder affecting the high-affinity, sodium-independent dibasic amino acid transporter found on the apical membrane of intestinal and proximal renal tubular epithelial cells.  This prevents cystine (cysteine homodimer that forms disulfide bonds) and dibasic amino acids (eg, ornithine, lysine, and arginine) from being reabsorbed in the proximal renal tubules, leading to urine supersaturation with cystine and formation of #cystine stones# (ornithine, lysine, and arginine are relatively soluble in the urine and do not form stones). $Patients with suspected cystinuria without cystine crystals on urinalysis can be diagnosed by detecting elevated urinary cystine levels (ie, #aminoaciduria#).  The #sodium cyanide-nitroprusside test# is a qualitative screening test that detects the presence of urinary cystine.  Cyanide is initially added to the urine, converting cystine to cysteine.  Afterward, nitroprusside is added and reacts with the sulfhydryl group on free cysteine, causing a red-purple discoloration (positive test).  Treatment of cystinuria involves increasing hydration and #urinary alkalinization# (eg, acetazolamide). $#(Choices B, C, D, and E)#  Hypercalciuria (eg, sarcoidosis), hyperoxaluria (eg, Crohn disease), and hypocitraturia (eg, distal renal tubular acidosis) are risk factors for recurrent calcium stone formation; high concentrations of calcium or oxalate promote precipitation into stones, while citrate inhibits stone formation by complexing with calcium in the urine, preventing spontaneous nucleation and crystal growth.  Hyperuricosuria (eg, gout) is a risk factor for recurrent uric acid stones, particularly in the setting of low urine pH. $#Educational objective# Cystinuria results from defective cystine reabsorption by proximal renal tubular epithelial cells.  It most often presents with recurrent stone formation at a young age.  Urinalysis shows pathognomonic hexagonal cystine crystals, and the sodium cyanide-nitroprusside test can be used to detect excess cystine in the urine. "

  "explanation_2": "This patient has acute flank pain and tenderness consistent with #nephrolithiasis#.  The pain associated with nephrolithiasis (renal colic) is often severe and, although it may wax and wane, is generally not positional.  The pain commonly radiates to the groin, especially as the stone passes down the ureter to the ureterovesical junction.  Nausea and vomiting are common, and bowel sounds are often diminished due to an associated ileus.  Hematuria is usually present but may not be grossly visible. $Most kidney stones are calcium-based (calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate).  But regardless of chemical composition, low fluid intake can lead to #supersaturation# of urine with crystalline material and promote stone formation.  #Increasing fluid intake# can reduce the risk of all types of stones. $#(Choice A)#  Excessive alcohol intake can trigger acute pancreatitis.  The pain associated with pancreatitis is typically located in the epigastric area rather than the flank and radiates to the back rather than the groin. $#(Choice B)#  Recurrent infections of the upper urinary tract with urease-producing organisms (eg, Klebsiella, Proteus) can lead to formation of magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) stones.  These stones are often large and may fill the renal pelvis.  Although patients may have mild flank pain due to recurrent infection, acute renal colic is uncommon as these large stones do not travel down the ureter. $#(Choice D)#  A high-fiber diet is associated with a decreased risk of diverticulitis.  This condition typically presents over a few days (not suddenly, as in this patient) with lower abdominal pain and tenderness in the left lower quadrant. $#(Choice E)#  Calcium passively follows the reabsorption of sodium and water in the renal tubules.  Increased dietary sodium intake leads to reduced sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule and lowers calcium reabsorption (leading to hypercalciuria). $#(Choice F)#  Dietary calcium binds oxalate in the gut to form unabsorbable calcium oxalate.  Low-calcium diets lead to increased absorption of free oxalate, which is then excreted in the urine; the resulting hyperoxaluria promotes the formation of calcium oxalate stones.  Low-calcium diets are therefore paradoxically associated with increased risk of stone formation. $#(Choice G)#  Untreated infection with chlamydia or gonorrhea can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, presenting with lower abdominal pain and fever.  Examination findings include mucopurulent cervical discharge and cervical motion tenderness. $#Educational objective# Urine supersaturation is the main mechanism underlying all types of renal stones.  Low fluid intake increases the concentration of stone-forming agents, thereby promoting stone formation.  All patients with nephrolithiasis should be advised to maintain adequate fluid intake. "

Etiologies include acute tubular necrosis (due to renal ischemia or nephrotoxins) or glomerular diseases (eg, glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome). $• #Postrenal:#  Caused by #urinary tract obstruction# with normal nephron capacity.  Etiologies include bilateral calculi, enlarged prostate, or a renal tumor in an individual with a sole functional kidney. $This patient with severe blood loss was at risk for prerenal and intrinsic renal failure; however, his rapid #improvement with hydration# suggests a prerenal (hypovolemic) etiology.  His laboratory results reflect intact renal tubular function, with compensatory mechanisms to restore blood volume.  Increased tubular sodium reabsorption results in #low urine sodium (<20 mEq/L)# and #low fractional excretion of sodium# (FENa), whereas increased water reabsorption leads to #high urine osmolarity#.  Urea reabsorption also increases to help concentrate the urine, resulting in increased serum levels of urea; creatinine continues to be excreted, resulting in the characteristic #BUN/creatinine ratio >20#. $In contrast, intrinsic ARF reflects tubular epithelium damage and loss of renal reabsorptive capacity.  Water, sodium, and urea are excreted in the urine, leading to lower urine osmolarity, higher urinary sodium, higher urinary FENa, and a normal serum BUN/creatinine ratio. $#(Choice A)#  Dark, granular, \"muddy brown\" casts seen on urinalysis are composed of degenerating tubular epithelial cells.

These alterations in the laboratory indices of renal function represent the diminished ability of tubular epithelial cells to reabsorb urea, sodium, and water, respectively. $#Educational objective# Blood volume loss can cause prerenal or intrinsic acute renal failure (ARF).  Prerenal ARF is associated with normal nephron function (eg, low urine sodium level, low fractionated sodium excretion, high urine osmolarity, and a high BUN/creatinine ratio), whereas intrinsic ARF features diminished renal reabsorptive capacity (eg, lower urine osmolarity, higher urinary sodium, normal serum BUN/creatinine ratio).

His kidney biopsy shows #apple-green birefringence# under polarized light (with specialized Congo red staining), which is pathognomonic for @amyloidosis@. $Amyloidosis is a disorder of protein folding.  Misfolded proteins form #insoluble fibrils#, resulting in extracellular deposition that causes #organ dysfunction#.  The parallel fibril alignment binds to Congo red in a regular manner that produces the birefringence seen on polarized microscopy.  Multiple precursor proteins can lead to amyloid fibril formation and can cause differing clinical manifestations based on the location of deposition. $#Renal amyloid# deposits result in glomerular damage, producing proteinuria, typically in the nephrotic range.  The most common precursor proteins causing kidney injury are serum amyloid A (AA amyloidosis) and immunoglobulin light chains #(AL amyloidosis)#.  Serum amyloid A is an acute phase reactant; AA amyloidosis usually occurs in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions (unlike this patient).  Therefore, #serum protein electrophoresis# would be helpful to look for a monoclonal protein produced by an undiagnosed plasma cell dyscrasia (eg, multiple myeloma, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia) causing AL amyloidosis. $#(Choice A)#  24-hour urinary copper excretion is elevated in Wilson disease, which typically presents with hepatic, neurologic, and psychiatric abnormalities.  Renal involvement is less common and causes tubular (eg, Fanconi syndrome) rather than glomerular dysfunction. $#(Choice B)#  24-hour urinary uric acid excretion is useful for evaluating disorders with hyperuricemia (eg, gout, kidney stones).  @Uric acid crystals@ share the property of birefringence on polarized microscopy.  However, nephrotic syndrome would be unexpected even with chronic urate nephropathy. $#(Choice D)#  Serum total bilirubin concentration is elevated in multiple disorders and can result from overproduction, impaired conjugation, biliary obstruction, or hepatocyte damage.  It has no role in determining the type of amyloidosis causing nephrotic syndrome. $#(Choice E)#  Serum total body iron content is indicated for the assessment of anemia and iron overload, neither of which is associated with nephrotic syndrome.  Liver biopsy is sometimes performed for @iron overload@, which shows intense staining with Prussian blue. $#Educational objective# Renal amyloidosis typically presents with proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome.  The diagnosis is confirmed by kidney biopsy showing apple-green birefringence with Congo red stain under polarized light.

  "explanation_2": "$#Diabetic nephropathy (DN)# is the most common cause of end-stage renal disease in the United States.  It occurs in both types 1 and 2 diabetes.  The earliest morphological change is glomerular basement membrane thickening with mesangial matrix expansion.  Normally, the glomerular basement membrane has negatively charged heparan sulfate moieties that form a charge barrier preventing leakage of negatively charged proteins (eg, albumin) into the Bowman capsule.  In diabetes, there is progressive loss of this negative charge due to upregulation of heparanase expression by renal epithelial cells, leading to leakage of albumin and other plasma proteins. $In the initial stages of DN, only small amounts of albumin (30-300 mg/day; ie, #moderately increased albuminuria#) are lost but can be detected with an albumin-specific urine assay (regular dipstick urinalysis has low sensitivity and is not recommended).  Early administration of #ACE inhibitors# in patients with diabetes and moderately increased albuminuria can reduce urinary albumin excretion and slow progression to overt DN. $#(Choice B)#  Glycosuria is seen at blood glucose levels >200-300 mg/dL due to saturation of renal glucose transporters.  Glycosuria reflects poor glycemic control but does not correlate with the degree of renal damage in DN. $#(Choice C)#  Ketonuria occurs in starvation and in conditions that cause ketoacidosis, such as insufficient insulin administration in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.  It is usually a transient phenomenon that corrects with treatment of the ketoacidosis. $#(Choice D)#  Red blood cell casts are a sign of glomerular bleeding, such as in glomerulonephritis (eg, poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis).  Diabetes mellitus usually causes a nephrotic syndrome with proteinuria and a bland urine sediment. $#(Choice E)#  Low-molecular-weight proteins (eg, beta-2 microglobulin, immunoglobulin light chains) are normally filtered by the glomerulus and reabsorbed in the renal tubules.  Damage to the tubular cells can cause loss of these tubular proteins in urine.  Ischemic tubular damage may be seen in advanced DN. $#(Choice F)#  Waxy casts are shiny, translucent structures formed in the dilated tubules of enlarged nephrons that undergo compensatory hypertrophy in response to reduced renal mass.  They indicate advanced renal disease (chronic renal failure). $#Educational objective# Moderately increased albuminuria (urine albumin 30-300 mg/day) is the earliest manifestation of diabetic nephropathy.

This reduces the amount of oxalate absorbed into the body and excreted in the urine, reducing stone formation. $#(Choice B)#  In patients with inadequate dietary intake of potassium, increased tubular reabsorption of potassium leads to increased citrate reabsorption, which facilitates formation of calcium oxalate complexes in the renal tubules.  Higher potassium intake promotes urinary excretion of citrate and lowers urinary calcium excretion, leading to a lower risk of calcium oxalate stones. $#(Choice C)#  High fluid intake prevents supersaturation of urine with stone-forming ingredients.  Low fluid intake increases the urinary concentration of these ions regardless of their absolute amounts, promoting stone formation. $#(Choice D)#  Excessive oxalate intake (eg, chocolate, spinach, rhubarb) leads to increased intestinal absorption of free oxalate, which is then excreted in the urine where it promotes formation of calcium oxalate stones.

It is not commonly associated with the formation of staghorn calculi. $#(Choice B)#  Cystine stones are uncommon, yellow-brown calculi that precipitate in acidic urine.  They usually develop in patients who have cystinuria secondary to genetic defects impairing renal cystine reabsorption.  Although cystinuria can sometimes result in large staghorn calculi due to persistent cystine excretion, this patient's recurrent urinary tract infections are more suggestive of struvite stone formation. $#(Choice D)#  Hyperparathyroidism due to a parathyroid adenoma can cause increased serum calcium levels that ultimately result in increased urinary calcium filtration, predisposing to formation of calcium oxalate stones.  These stones typically present with renal colic due to acute ureterolithiasis, and most patients do not have significant fever or a history of recurrent urinary tract infection. $#Educational objective# Staghorn calculi are large renal stones that take on the shape of the renal calyces.  They are composed primarily of struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate) and are associated with recurrent upper urinary tract infections by urease-producing organisms (eg, Proteus, Klebsiella).  Hydrolysis of urea yields ammonia, which alkalinizes the urine and facilitates precipitation of struvite crystals. ",

  "explanation_2": "$This patient with an extensive #smoking history,# 4.5-kg weight loss, painless hematuria, hypercalcemia, and renal mass likely has #renal cell carcinoma# (RCC).  RCC originates in the renal cortex and accounts for up to 90% of primary renal tumors.  It is often identified incidentally on radiographic imaging, and many individuals remain #asymptomatic# until the disease is relatively advanced.  Hematuria is the most common symptom, and #painless hematuria# in an older adult should raise suspicion for a genitourinary malignancy.  Patients may also have flank pain and a palpable abdominal mass at the time of presentation. $Paraneoplastic syndromes are common in RCC due to the secretion of biologically active substances by the tumor cells.  #Hypercalcemia# is frequently seen due to increased production of parathyroid hormone–related peptide or overproduction of prostaglandins that promote bony resorption.  #Erythrocytosis# due to ectopic erythropoietin production may also be seen. $#(Choice A)#  Bladder cancer is another common cause of hematuria and weight loss; however, CT scan would demonstrate a @bladder mass@.  This malignancy tends to metastasize to the liver, bones, and lungs.  Although hypercalcemia may occur occasionally, it is more strongly associated with RCC. $#(Choice B)#  Pheochromocytoma can cause severe, episodic hypertension associated with headaches, anxiety, palpitations, and sweating.  A CT scan would reveal a @suprarenal mass@, and urine catecholamines and metanephrine would likely be elevated.  Hematuria is not seen. $#(Choice C)#  Polycystic kidney disease can cause hematuria; however, flank pain is common, and imaging would show @bilateral renal cysts@, not a unilateral mass.  In addition, weight loss and hypercalcemia would be unexpected. $#(Choice D)#  Prostate cancer typically presents with discrete nodules or asymmetric induration of the prostate on digital rectal examination.  Diffuse, symmetric enlargement and firmness of the prostate are more suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia. $#(Choice F)#  Ureterolithiasis is a common cause of hematuria, and patients with hypercalcemia from other causes (eg, hyperparathyroidism) are predisposed to stone formation.  However, ureterolithiasis would not explain this patient's large, heterogeneous renal mass and unintended weight loss (which are highly suggestive of malignancy). $#Educational objective# Classic signs and symptoms of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) include hematuria, an abdominal mass, flank pain, and weight loss.

However, urinalysis would demonstrate muddy-brown, granular casts, and NSAIDs are not commonly associated with ATN. $#(Choice E)#  Vasculitis involving the glomerular capillaries (eg, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis) causes a nephritic syndrome; urinalysis would demonstrate red blood cells and red blood cell casts.  In addition, patients with vasculitides typically have associated systemic symptoms (eg, fever, fatigue, weight loss). $#Educational objective# Patients with intravascular volume depletion (eg, congestive heart failure, diarrhea, excessive diuresis) and chronic kidney disease depend on renal prostaglandin production to dilate the afferent glomerular arteriole and maintain the glomerular filtration rate.

Both types of follicular neoplasms have a similar appearance on ultrasound and FNA. $Differentiating between benign and malignant follicular lesions can only be accomplished by histologic examination of the entire tumor (eg, thyroidectomy). $• @Follicular adenomas@ (the most common benign thyroid neoplasm) display numerous neoplastic follicular cells and microfollicles on histology but are completely encapsulated. $• In contrast, #follicular thyroid carcinomas# are characterized by #invasion of the tumor capsule# and/or surrounding blood vessels. $This propensity of follicular thyroid carcinomas to invade surrounding blood vessels accounts for their tendency to metastasize via #hematogenous spread# to distant tissues (eg, bone, lung). $#(Choice A)#  @Medullary thyroid carcinomas@ can develop sporadically or in patients with an inherited RET proto-oncogene mutation (eg, multiple endocrine neoplasia 2a or 2b).

In such cases, measurement of glycated serum proteins (ie, fructosamine) is sometimes used to estimate glycemic control. $#(Choices B and C)#  Deficiencies of iron, folate, and vitamin B12 can reduce production of new red cells, leading to a preponderance of older erythrocytes and falsely elevated hemoglobin A1c.  In contrast, treatment of vitamin deficiencies causes young red cells to be rapidly released into circulation, falsely lowering hemoglobin A1c. $#(Choice D)#  Advanced diabetic nephropathy may cause reduced erythropoietin production.  The resulting decrease in production of new red cells may lead to falsely high hemoglobin A1c (similar to nutrient deficiencies). $#(Choice E)#  Chronically elevated blood glucose (ie, poor glycemic control) is the primary cause of increased hemoglobin A1c in patients with diabetes. $#(Choice F)#  Sickle cell trait is characterized by heterozygous carriage of hemoglobin S.  Some patients with sickle cell trait can have slightly reduced hemoglobin A1c level due to increased red cell turnover (homozygous individuals with sickle cell disease have rapid red cell turnover and very low A1c).  However, hemoglobin A2 percentage remains near normal in patients with sickle cell mutations. $#Educational objective# Hemoglobin A1c is produced by nonenzymatic glycosylation of the hemoglobin molecule.  A hemoglobin A1c assay provides an estimate of chronic glycemic control over the life span of circulating erythrocytes (~3 months).

  "explanation_2": "$This patient has acne, testicular atrophy, and erythrocytosis, findings concerning for #androgenic steroid abuse#.  Abuse of androgens, androgen precursors, and agents that increase endogenous androgen production is most common in young adults who engage in competitive athletic activities or for cosmetic purposes. $Chronic androgen use may increase muscle mass but has multiple associated risks.  Testosterone stimulates red blood cell production, which accounts for the higher hematocrit in normal males compared to normal females.  This effect is exaggerated in exogenous androgen abuse, which #increases hematocrit# in a dose-dependent manner.  Androgens decrease gonadotropin secretion, which results in #testicular atrophy# and decreased sperm production.  Other common findings include #virilization# in women (eg, clitoromegaly, hirsutism) and #acne#. $#(Choices A and D)#  Mutations that cause a high oxygen affinity of hemoglobin reduce the ability of hemoglobin to release oxygen in tissues.  Low tissue oxygen levels in the kidneys stimulate erythropoietin release.  Renal artery stenosis decreases oxygen delivery to the kidney and also stimulates erythropoietin release.  These conditions may produce a compensatory erythrocytosis but would not produce the other clinical signs (eg, acne, testicular atrophy) seen in this patient. $#(Choice B)#  Intensive exercise could result in elevated myoglobin secondary to rhabdomyolysis, but the hematocrit level should not be changed by exercise. $#(Choice C)#  Myeloproliferative disorders, such as polycythemia vera (PV), can lead to erythrocytosis.  Patients with PV typically have leukocytosis and thrombocytosis as well.  This patient's additional physical findings make steroid abuse more likely. $#(Choice F)#  Heavy sweating may cause a transient increase in hematocrit due to loss of plasma volume but would likely cause other signs of dehydration (eg, tachycardia).  This patient's creatinine at the upper limit of normal is typical for patients with increased total muscle mass; hypovolemia also will usually cause a more pronounced rise in blood urea nitrogen. $#Educational objective# Androgenic steroid abuse may lead to erythrocytosis, testicular atrophy, acne, and virilization in women (eg, clitoromegaly, hirsutism).

This patient has #secondary amenorrhea#, which usually occurs due to endocrine dysfunction (eg, hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis dysfunction, thyroid disorder), pregnancy, or intrauterine adhesions (ie, Asherman syndrome). $This patient's distorted body image (feeling overweight despite underweight BMI), restricted diet, exercise regimen, dry skin, and lanugo (fine hair indicating inadequate caloric intake) suggest #anorexia nervosa#, a common cause of #functional hypothalamic amenorrhea# (FHA).  The pathophysiology of FHA is incompletely understood but is thought to arise due to diminished adipose tissue stores, which reduce circulating leptin levels.  In response, the hypothalamus decreases the amplitude and frequency of pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release, leading to #low GnRH# levels, #decreased pituitary LH and FSH# secretion, #low circulating estrogen# levels, anovulation, and amenorrhea #(choices C and E)#. $In addition to anorexia nervosa, FHA can also occur when caloric expenditure is out of proportion to intake, such as in female #athletes# (eg, distance runners, dancers) or patients with chronic illness, particularly those with low adipose stores.  FHA is a form of hypogonadotrophic (low LH and FSH) hypogonadism (low estrogen).  Therefore, potential complications in young patients include reduced peak bone mass, which may lead to early-onset #osteoporosis#. $#(Choice A)#  Low circulating estrogen levels despite increased GnRH and FSH secretion are consistent with a primary ovarian disorder (eg, primary ovarian insufficiency [POI], menopause).  POI is associated with Turner syndrome and prior chemoradiation, not anorexia nervosa. $#(Choice B)#  Pituitary dysfunction, which includes anatomic (eg, prolactinoma) and functional disorders (eg, hypopituitarism due to infarction [Sheehan syndrome]), can cause hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and amenorrhea characterized by increased GnRH, low FSH and LH, and low estrogen.  However, prolactinomas typically present with additional clinical features (eg, bilateral galactorrhea), and Sheehan syndrome is usually associated with prior hemorrhage, particularly obstetric hemorrhage. $#Educational objective# Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea is a common cause of secondary amenorrhea and occurs due to decreased amplitude and frequency of pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone release from the hypothalamus, which in turn leads to low FSH, LH, and estrogen levels.

  "explanation_2": "This patient has a plantar ulcer under the first metatarsal head.  In a patient with chronic, poorly controlled #diabetes mellitus#, this is likely a #neuropathic ulcer# due to underlying peripheral #sensory neuropathy#.  Chronic hyperglycemia promotes nerve injury and impairs nerve repair in distal sensory fibers, causing decreased sensation of pain, pressure, and proprioception. $Loss of these protective senses can cause individuals to not recognize an injury due to minor trauma, friction, or #pressure#.  Areas that are particularly susceptible are points of localized pressure created by a shoe or weight-bearing bones of the foot (eg, plantar surface of the #first metatarsal head#).  A wound in this area often goes unnoticed (due to lack of pain sensation and being hidden by socks or shoes) and can develop into a nonhealing @foot ulcer@. $Loss of proprioception and an increase in ligamentous laxity can also cause chronic pressure-induced joint/skin damage in the feet of patients with diabetic neuropathy, which can lead to calluses or foot deformities (eg, @Charcot foot@, @hammer toe@). $#(Choice A)#  Although diabetic patients (especially those who smoke) often have comorbid arterial insufficiency, arterial ulcers are typically painful, sharply demarcated, and located at the tips of the toes.  This patient has full distal pulses, which makes clinically significant atherosclerotic disease unlikely to be the primary cause of the ulcer. $#(Choice B)#  Bacterial infection may delay ulcer healing, especially if there is underlying osteomyelitis, but it is not the inciting cause of neuropathic ulcers.  In addition, although diabetic ulcers are often colonized by bacteria, this patient has no fever, erythema, or purulent drainage to suggest serious infection. $#(Choice C)#  @Irritant contact dermatitis@ presents with pruritic or painful erythema in areas of exposed skin (eg, hands).  It can occasionally cause small vesicles or fissures, but ulcers are not typical. $#(Choice E)#  Systemic vasculitic disorders (eg, polyarteritis nodosa) are an uncommon cause of skin ulcers.  Vasculitic ulcers are usually painful and associated with other skin (eg, purpura, nodules) and systemic (eg, fever, fatigue) symptoms. $#(Choice F)#  Ulcers caused by @venous insufficiency@ are most common over the tibias or proximal to the medial malleolus.  They present as irregular ulcerations in the setting of stasis dermatitis and/or varicose veins. $#Educational objective# Neuropathic foot ulcers can occur in diabetic patients when loss of pain sensation and proprioception delays recognition of injury due to trauma, friction, or sustained pressure (on plantar surface of foot bones).

Hyperlipidemia and/or dyslipidemia can result in xanthomas (including xanthelasmas).  Xanthelasmas are dermal accumulations of benign-appearing macrophages with abundant, finely vacuolated (foamy) cytoplasm containing cholesterol (free and esterified), phospholipids, and triglycerides.  Due in part to insulin resistance promoting increased VLDL production, diabetics may develop a secondary Type IV or V hyperlipidemia (increased VLDL, chylomicrons) and/or a secondary diabetic dyslipidemia with elevated LDL cholesterol and low HDL cholesterol.

However, a serum lipid profile should be obtained next in order to establish the type of hyperlipidemia or dyslipidemia in this patient. $#(Choice F)#  Xanthelasmas are usually diagnosed based on clinical appearance.  Biopsy is not required.  Treatment is primarily medical and directed at the underlying lipid abnormality.  Surgical excision is not medically necessary, but may be undertaken electively for cosmetic reasons. $#Educational objective# Xanthelasmas, a type of xanthoma, are yellowish macules/papules found on the medial eyelids.

  "explanation_2": "This patient has signs of #panhypopituitarism# with failure of lactation, central hypothyroidism, and adrenal insufficiency.  In the setting of a recent delivery, this most likely represents #ischemic necrosis# of the #pituitary gland# (Sheehan syndrome).  During pregnancy, the pituitary enlarges due to estrogen-induced hyperplasia of the lactotrophs.  However, the blood supply to the pituitary does not increase proportionally.  As a result, the enlarged pituitary is vulnerable to ischemia in case of systemic hypotension due to #peripartum hemorrhage# (which this patient likely experienced given her low hemoglobin). $The most common manifestation of Sheehan syndrome is failure of lactation due to prolactin deficiency.  It also commonly causes hypocortisolism and hypothyroidism.  Manifestations of thyroid deficiency may take a few weeks to develop due to the long circulating half-life of thyroxine (5-7 days) and peripheral conversion of thyroxine (T4) to T3.  Cortisol deficiency manifests rapidly, however, with nausea, postural hypotension, fatigue, and weight loss. $#(Choice A)#  Pituitary apoplexy is due to sudden hemorrhage into the pituitary, usually in the setting of a preexisting pituitary adenoma.  It usually presents with acute severe headache, ophthalmoplegia, and altered sensorium. $#(Choice B)#  Lymphocytic hypophysitis is the most common inflammatory condition of the pituitary and typically occurs during late pregnancy or the early postpartum period.  In contrast to Sheehan syndrome, the presentation is acute with severe headaches and visual field defects. $#(Choice D)#  Primary pituitary cancer is extremely rare, although the pituitary is prone to metastases due to its rich vascular supply.  These patients typically present with tumor mass effects (eg, headache, bitemporal hemianopsia). $#(Choice E)#  Non-malignant infiltrative lesions such as sarcoidosis and histiocytosis X mainly involve the suprasellar region, where they compress the hypothalamus and pituitary stalk.  This disrupts the normal hypothalamic dopaminergic suppression of prolactin secretion, leading to increased prolactin levels and possible galactorrhea.  Central diabetes insipidus may also be seen with resulting hypernatremia. $#Educational objective# High estrogen levels during pregnancy cause enlargement of the pituitary gland without a proportional increase in blood supply.

PAI usually results from autoimmune destruction of the bilateral adrenal cortex and is more likely to occur in patients with a personal or family #history of autoimmune disease# (eg, Hashimoto thyroiditis).  Because all 3 layers of the @adrenal cortex@ are affected, clinical manifestations result from a reduction in circulating mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, and androgens. $#Reduced aldosterone#, the principal mineralocorticoid in the body, leads to markedly decreased sodium absorption by the renal collecting tubule @principal cells@ with consequent retention of potassium (leading to #hyperkalemia#).  The decrease in total body sodium results in #hypovolemia# and #hypotension# that may lead to renal insufficiency.  The hypovolemia provides nonosmotic stimulus for #antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion#, which stimulates water retention and leads to #hyponatremia#. $Cortisol, the main glucocorticoid in the body, normally inhibits ADH secretion; therefore, #reduced cortisol# further contributes to hyponatremia.  Cortisol is also necessary for the synthesis of epinephrine in the adrenal medulla; the consequent reduction in circulating epinephrine leads to a compensatory #increase in norepinephrine# to increase vascular tone in an effort to maintain blood pressure. $#(Choice B)#  Increased ADH and normal levels of cortisol, aldosterone, and norepinephrine occur in the syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH).  SIADH presents with hyponatremia, but it does not explain this patient's hyperkalemia, salt craving, and orthostatic symptoms. $#(Choices C, D, and E)#  Elevations in aldosterone, ADH, and norepinephrine occur in conditions that decrease effective arterial blood volume and renal perfusion (eg, heart failure, cirrhosis, dehydration).  Cortisol levels are often elevated in dehydration and heart failure; total cortisol is low in cirrhosis due to reduced cortisol-binding protein levels. $#(Choice F)#  Increased cortisol with reduced levels of aldosterone, ADH, and norepinephrine can occur with ectopic ACTH production (eg, due to small cell lung cancer).  Aldosterone synthesis is mostly independent of ACTH and is suppressed because cortisol and other glucocorticoids have some mineralocorticoid activity.  Levels of ADH and norepinephrine are also generally suppressed. $#Educational objective# Primary adrenal insufficiency usually involves autoimmune destruction of the bilateral adrenal cortex.  Reduced aldosterone production leads to renal salt wasting with hypovolemia, hypotension, and hyperkalemia.

Presumably, this patient died from a complication of advanced atherosclerosis, such as a myocardial infarction.  His father's similar fate at a young age suggests a familial condition, most likely familial hypercholesterolemia.  Familial hypercholesterolemia is one of the most common inherited disorders, and results from autosomal dominant mutations of the LDL receptor gene. $The liver LDL receptor is normally the greatest contributor to the removal of cholesterol-containing IDL and LDL particles from the circulation.  Although numerous other cell types, including smooth muscle cells, adrenocortical cells, fibroblasts, and lymphocytes also express high-affinity LDL receptors, approximately 70% of the plasma LDL is normally cleared by the liver.  Heterozygotes with one mutant LDL receptor gene have a 2- to 3-fold elevation of plasma cholesterol from birth, due to reduced hepatic IDL and LDL uptake.  Homozygotes may have a 5- to 6-fold elevation.  In both heterozygotes and homozygotes, the progression of atherosclerosis with aging is accelerated.  Complications include coronary artery disease at an unusually young age, as was the case for the patient in the vignette. $#(Choices A, B, D, E and F) #Although many cell types express the LDL receptor, their rate of LDL uptake from the circulation is usually less than that of hepatocytes.

  "explanation_2": "This patient's hypertension, proximal muscle weakness, and hyperglycemia are suggestive of excess cortisol (ie, #Cushing syndrome# [CS]).  Hypercortisolism can be confirmed by finding elevated cortisol levels in a late-night salivary sample or 24-hour urine collection.  Additionally, low-dose dexamethasone suppression testing can also be useful for confirming the diagnosis; administration of a small dose of a potent glucocorticoid rapidly @suppresses ACTH@ and cortisol secretion in normal individuals, but patients with CS are resistant to low-dose glucocorticoids so serum cortisol remains elevated. $Once the diagnosis is confirmed, the next step is #establishing the cause# of CS, which involves measurement of @serum ACTH levels@: $• Low ACTH levels are seen with autonomous adrenal production of cortisol (eg, adrenal adenoma or carcinoma) or exogenous glucocorticoid exposure due to feedback suppression $• #High ACTH# levels occur with pituitary adenomas (ie, Cushing disease) or ectopic ACTH production by nonpituitary tumors, which can be further distinguished with the #high-dose dexamethasone suppression test#: $○ Pituitary sources of ACTH are only relatively resistant to feedback inhibition, and high doses of dexamethasone will suppress ACTH and cortisol levels #(choice A)# $○ Nonpituitary #ectopic sources# of ACTH (eg, #small cell lung cancer#) are completely resistant to feedback inhibition, and ACTH and cortisol will remain elevated following high doses of dexamethasone $This patient's rapid symptom onset, heavy smoking history, and lung mass are consistent with paraneoplastic CS, likely due to small cell lung cancer.  #ACTH and cortisol production# will likely be #unchanged# following high-dose dexamethasone. $#(Choices B and C)#  In normal individuals, dexamethasone suppresses ACTH release from the pituitary.  In patients with abnormal pituitary or ectopic ACTH production, dexamethasone affects ACTH levels as described above.  However, dexamethasone does not stimulate ACTH release in any setting. $#(Choice D)#  The fall in cortisol seen in dexamethasone suppression tests is due to feedback suppression causing decreased ACTH release.  A fall in cortisol would not be seen without a corresponding fall in ACTH. $#Educational objective# Cushing syndrome caused by a pituitary adenoma or ectopic (paraneoplastic) ACTH secretion is associated with elevated ACTH levels.  High-dose dexamethasone suppresses ACTH and cortisol secretion when Cushing syndrome is caused by a pituitary adenoma (Cushing disease) but not when it is caused by ectopic ACTH secretion (eg, small cell lung cancer).

Normally, as blood glucose falls, endogenous insulin secretion is suppressed, and serum levels of both insulin and C-peptide drop. $Hypoglycemia due to excessive #endogenous insulin production# is associated with #elevated levels of C-peptide#.  This can occur due to autonomous insulin-producing tumors (insulinomas) or intake of insulin secretagogues (eg, #sulfonylureas#).

  "explanation_2": "@Deficiency of 21-hydroxylase@ is the most common form of #congenital adrenal hyperplasia# and leads to impaired conversion of 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) to 11-deoxycortisol.  Excess 17-OHP is shunted away from cortisol synthesis toward androgen production.  #ACTH increases# due to the decline in cortisol levels and has a trophic effect on adrenal cortical cells, causing #adrenal cortical hyperplasia#. $Depending on the residual enzyme activity, 21-hydroxylase deficiency can present as 3 distinct clinical syndromes of differing severity.  This patient most likely has the #classic, non–salt-wasting# (ie, simple virilizing) form of the disease.  Because 21-hydroxylase is not completely absent (as in the most severe form), sufficient mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids are maintained to avoid salt wasting such that patients have normal blood pressure and electrolytes.  Due to #adrenal androgen overproduction#, girls with this variant are often identified at birth due to ambiguous genitalia.  #Boys# appear normal at birth and typically present around #age 2-4# with #early virilization# (eg, body odor, pubic/axillary hair).  Exposure to high levels of sex hormones also induces an early pubertal growth spurt that manifests as #accelerated linear growth# at a young age. $In all forms of 21-hydroxylase deficiency, patients have #increased 17-OHP# and androgen levels.  Adrenal androgens (eg, dehydroepiandrosterone and androstenedione) undergo peripheral conversion to testosterone, which explains this patient's #high testosterone# level. $#(Choice B)#  Adrenal medullary hyperplasia is a precursor lesion for pheochromocytoma characterized by increased catecholamine production.  Presenting signs include hypertension, tachycardia, and sweating (not virilization). $#(Choice C)#  Leydig cell tumors produce excess testosterone and can present with precocious puberty in young boys (eg, early testicular/phallic enlargement).  A testicular mass is typically palpated on examination. $#(Choice D)#  Production of excess LH and FSH by pituitary adenomas can lead to increased testosterone but not increased 17-OHP levels.  Pituitary adenomas producing excess ACTH can lead to excess adrenal androgen production; however, symptoms of excess cortisol production (Cushing syndrome) such as growth deceleration and weight gain would predominate. $#(Choice E)#  A seminoma is a testicular tumor most commonly found in adolescents and adults.  These tumors are derived from the seminiferous tubules and present with a testicular mass, not virilization and elevated testosterone. $#Educational objective# Deficiency of 21-hydroxylase causes adrenal cortical hyperplasia due to excess stimulation of the adrenal cortex by ACTH.  The classic, non–salt-wasting form presents in boys age 2-4 with early virilization, accelerated linear growth, and elevated levels of 17-hydroxyprogesterone and androgens. ",

Kallmann syndrome results from a failure of GnRH-secreting neurons to migrate from their origin in the olfactory placode (situated outside the central nervous system) to their normal anatomic location in the hypothalamus.  Most often, the cause is a mutation in the KAL-1 gene or the fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 gene, which code for proteins required in this migration. $Patients with Kallmann syndrome classically have central hypogonadism and anosmia, although there may be other midline defects as well (eg, cleft lip or cleft palate).  Most often, these patients present with delayed puberty.  On physical examination, the testes are often just 1-2 mL in volume.  There is usually some pubic hair because adrenarche occurs normally. $In the United States, delayed puberty is defined as the absence or incomplete development of secondary sexual characteristics by age 14 in boys and by age 12 in girls.  Testicular enlargement is the first sign of puberty in boys, and breast enlargement is the first sign in girls.  The initiation of puberty and the maintenance of secondary sexual characteristics and fertility require the coordinated efforts of the hypothalamus, pituitary, and gonads.  Delayed puberty can result from a derangement anywhere in this axis. $#(Choices B, C, D, and E)#  These pathways represent @normal feedback loops@ between the testes and the hypothalamus and pituitary.

Large pituitary tumors can cause #headaches# due to mass effect, and compression of the optic chiasm by suprasellar extension of the tumor can lead to @bitemporal hemianopsia@. $The most common type of pituitary adenoma is a #prolactinoma#.  Prolactin is a peptide hormone secreted from lactotrophs of the pituitary gland whose primary physiologic action is maintenance of lactation in postpartum women.  Hyperprolactinemia also #suppresses GnRH production# in the hypothalamus, leading to #oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea# and infertility.  Suppression of ovulation is also seen as a physiologic effect of breastfeeding, which supports elevated prolactin levels for 6 months or more postpartum. $#(Choice A)#  Kallmann syndrome is a disorder involving the GnRH-producing neurons in the hypothalamus.  In addition to decreased sense of smell (anosmia/hyposomia), this condition causes hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and presents with short stature and delayed puberty (primary amenorrhea).  This patient has secondary amenorrhea (ie, normal initial onset of puberty followed by menstrual dysregulation), and her bilateral temporal visual deficits are more suggestive of a pituitary rather than hypothalamic lesion. $#(Choice B)#  Ovarian granulosa cells produce estrogen, progesterone, and inhibin.  Loss of these cells (eg, due to autoimmune disorder) can lead to primary ovarian insufficiency and present with infertility and secondary amenorrhea.  However, patients often have hypoestrogenic symptoms (eg, hot flashes), and this disorder would not cause visual field defects. $#(Choice C)#  Ovarian theca cells produce androgens, which provide the substrate for subsequent synthesis of estrogens.  Amenorrhea and infertility related to hyperactivity of these cells are typically associated with signs of hyperandrogenism (eg, hirsutism). $#(Choice E)#  Unlike most pituitary hormones, which are under positive regulation by the hypothalamus, prolactin is primarily under negative regulation by hypothalamic dopaminergic neurons via the pituitary stalk.  Because of this, any pituitary tumor of significant size that disrupts these dopaminergic pathways can cause moderate hyperprolactinemia.  However, somatotroph adenomas typically cause @acromegaly@, with prognathism and bony enlargement of the hands and feet. $#Educational objective# Prolactinomas are the most common pituitary adenoma and can cause galactorrhea, menstrual irregularities, and infertility in premenopausal women.  Large pituitary adenomas can cause headaches from mass effect and bitemporal hemianopsia from compression of the optic chiasm. ",

This patient's concomitant #skin hyperpigmentation# is highly suggestive of chronic #primary adrenal insufficiency# (PAI), as the resulting cortisol deficiency leads to increased ACTH secretion.

  "explanation_2": "The patient described in this vignette has type 2 diabetes mellitus (advanced age, obesity, prolonged non-compliance with treatment without immediate life-threatening consequences).  The two cardinal defects involved in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus are increased insulin resistance and defective insulin secretion.  Although still controversial, many researchers believe that increased insulin resistance is the primary abnormality in type 2 diabetes mellitus.  Early in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, glucose tolerance is thought to remain normal because of a compensatory increase in insulin secretion from beta cells.  This compensatory insulin response by beta cells ultimately fails, causing poor glucose tolerance.  A number of genetic and acquired factors are implicated in the beta-cell dysregulation of type 2 diabetes.  Islet amyloid polypeptide (amylin) is one factor thought to be responsible for this beta cell dysfunction.  Amylin is stored in insulin secretory granules and is co-secreted with insulin from pancreatic beta cells.  Deposits of amylin are universally seen in the pancreatic islets of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  Amylin may play a causative role in beta cell apoptosis and defective insulin secretion; however, this theory is still controversial. $Type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus have very strong genetic components.  Twin studies have shown a concordance rate of 50% in identical twins for diabetes mellitus type 1, and around 80% for diabetes mellitus type 2.  The genes involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus type 2 remain largely unknown.  Gene polymorphism within the major histocompatibility complex contributes to type 1 diabetes mellitus disease in humans.  HLA-DQ and -DR are the most important determinants of type 1 diabetes mellitus.  In the general population, DR3 and DR4 are seen in approximately 40% of subjects; however, in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, DR3 and DR4 haplotypes are seen in more than 90% of subjects. $#(Choices A, C, D & E)  #These are features of type 1 diabetes mellitus.  Type 1 diabetes occurs when an autoimmune response is triggered by an environmental insult in genetically susceptible individuals.  Patients with type 2 diabetes retain at least some beta cell function, but patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus develop absolute deficiency of insulin secondary to immune destruction of pancreatic beta cells.  These patients need insulin for survival.  Discontinuation of insulin treatment results in ketoacidosis.  $#Educational objective# Pancreatic islet amyloid deposition is characteristic of type 2 diabetes mellitus.  A strong linkage with HLA class II gene makeup, pancreatic islet infiltration with leukocytes (insulitis), and antibodies against islet antigens are frequently seen in type 1 diabetes. "

ACTH secreted by small cell lung cancer is not inhibited by high-dose exogenous corticosteroids (eg, dexamethasone), whereas pituitary ACTH secretion decreases via negative feedback. $#(Choice B)#  Cortisol is produced by the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex, and autonomous cortisol production (ie, ACTH-independent hypercortisolism) is almost always due to a primary adrenal disorder (eg, adrenal adenoma).  Regardless of the source, excess cortisol in a patient with intact hypothalamus-pituitary function suppresses ACTH and patients do not develop hyperpigmentation. $#(Choice C)#  Given this patient's large lung mass and associated weight loss (instead of weight gain and central fat deposition), paraneoplastic ACTH secretion is more likely than an ACTH-producing pituitary adenoma (Cushing disease). $#(Choice D)#  Metastasis to the hypothalamus would likely cause endocrine insufficiency resulting from a lack of trophic hormones to the anterior pituitary.  Decreased production of corticotropin-releasing hormone would lead to central adrenal insufficiency, not hypercortisolism. $#(Choice E)#  The adrenal glands are a common site of metastasis.  If significant destruction of the adrenal cortical tissue occurs bilaterally, adrenal insufficiency may result.  A subsequent increase of ACTH may cause hyperpigmentation; however, symptoms of adrenal insufficiency (eg, hypotension) would be expected, as opposed to the symptoms of cortisol excess seen in this patient. $#Educational objective# Paraneoplastic hypercortisolism, most commonly caused by small cell lung cancer, is due to ectopic ACTH secretion.

Patients are usually hypotensive due to dehydration and the vasodilatory effects of VIP. $#(Choice F)#  Diabetes mellitus is present in the majority of patients with glucagonoma, most likely due to excessive hepatic glucose production.  Insulin levels tend to be normal but can be elevated secondary to hyperglycemia and glucagon-induced stimulation of the pancreatic beta cells. $#(Choice G)#  Zinc deficiency causes erythematous skin lesions (mainly around body orifices) that are predominantly vesicular and pustular.  Other features include hypogonadism, impaired taste and smell, night blindness, and impaired wound healing.  Although the skin lesions in zinc deficiency can resemble necrolytic migratory erythema, this patient's lack of additional findings and her recent diabetes mellitus diagnosis make glucagonoma more likely. $#Educational objective# Glucagonoma presents with hyperglycemia (often as newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus) and necrolytic migratory erythema (blistering erythematous plaques with central clearing) affecting the groin, face, and extremities.

Skin involvement typically manifests as monomorphic, reddish-brown macules that gradually proliferate and spread over months to years; because of histamine release, the lesions characteristically develop erythema or urticaria when scratched. $#(Choice D)#  @Sweet syndrome@ (ie, acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) is a rare inflammatory disorder associated with pathologic neutrophilic infiltration into the skin.  Because of their inflammatory nature, lesions are typically erythematous, edematous, and tender; ulceration like that of pyoderma gangrenosum (another neutrophilic disease of the skin) may occur.  Lesions are classically accompanied by frequent fever. $#(Choice E)#  Melanocytic nevi are caused by the benign proliferation of nevus cells, a type of melanocyte that forms clusters instead of single units evenly dispersed throughout the skin.  @Acquired melanocytic nevi@ may be elliptical, raised, and nontender; however, they are not typically violaceous, and most appear in childhood or adolescence (vs adulthood). $#Educational objective# Kaposi sarcoma often presents as multiple red, purple, or brown lesions on the lower extremities in patients with HIV infection.  It is a vascular tumor caused by human herpesvirus type 8 infection of endothelial cells. ",

  "explanation_2": "This patient's persistent skin lesion in a sun-exposed area (eg, ear) is concerning for #skin cancer#, particularly basal cell carcinoma (BCC) or cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).  Both BCC and cutaneous SCC, which are composed of malignant keratinocytes, can present as a skin-colored nodule.  Sometimes differences in #gross appearance# and texture can help distinguish between the two neoplasms: $• @Nodular BCC@ classically has a translucent or pearly appearance, often with central telangiectasias. $• @Cutaneous SCC@ classically has a rough or #scaly (keratinized) surface#. $BCC and SCC are not always distinguishable based on gross findings (eg, either may develop ulceration and/or crusting).  Therefore, #biopsy# is essential to make the correct diagnosis: $• BCC:  Biopsy typically shows nests of @basaloid cells@ (ie, resembling the stratum basale) that appear dark blue due to their basophilic, hyperchromatic nuclei and scant cytoplasm.  Cells at the periphery frequently display parallel alignment (ie, peripheral palisading) #(choice B)#. $• SCC:  Biopsy typically shows nests of @dysplastic keratinocytes@, which often have abundant cytoplasm that appears #eosinophilic# due to keratin filaments.  Keratin pearls (also eosinophilic) are commonly present. $#Dermal involvement# represents invasion of the dysplastic keratinocytes past the basement membrane, classifying this patient's lesion as #invasive# (rather than in situ) SCC. $#(Choice A)#  Actinic keratoses also consist of dysplastic keratinocytes and can appear as @scaly lesions@ on sun-exposed areas.  However, they are premalignant (vs malignant) lesions; the dysplastic keratinocytes do not involve the full thickness of the epidermis (eg, SCC in situ) or invade the dermis (eg, invasive SCC). $#(Choice C)#  @Seborrheic keratoses@ usually have a velvety or greasy (vs scaly) surface and a 'stuck-on' appearance.  Because they are a result of benign clonal expansion of immature keratinocytes, @histologic examination@ typically reveals proliferation of small basaloid cells that are not dysplastic.  Hyperkeratosis (thickened stratum corneum) and keratin-containing cysts are commonly seen. $#(Choice E)#  @Verruca vulgaris@ (ie, common wart) due to human papillomavirus often presents as a nodule or plaque with a rough, hyperkeratotic surface.  However, @histologic examination@ typically reveals acanthosis (thickened epidermis), hyperkeratosis, and koilocytosis (keratinocytes with cytoplasmic vacuolization); dysplastic keratinocytes invading the dermis are not seen. $#Educational objective# Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) classically presents as a rough or scaly (keratinized) nodule.  Diagnosis is made with biopsy, which typically reveals nests of dysplastic keratinocytes with eosinophilic cytoplasm (due to keratin filaments).  Dermal involvement signifies invasive SCC. ",

During the proliferation phase, fibroblasts multiply and synthesize ground substance and type III collagen, which form an amorphous gel into which new capillaries can grow.  In addition, fibroblasts secrete #fibroblast growth factor# and #vascular endothelial growth factor#, which stimulate endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation—leading to the formation of new capillaries. $By increasing the number of capillaries within the healing surgical incision, angiogenesis increases blood flow to the area, causing the #pink and slightly warm# characteristics of the wound at this stage.  The incision's newly formed epithelium (ie, reepithelialization) typically has a shiny appearance as well. $#(Choices A and C)#  Degranulation of mast cells and infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes occur during the inflammation phase, which starts within hours of the injury and lasts approximately 5 days.  During this phase, there is often moderate edema, redness, and/or warmth of the wound and nearby soft tissues due to high levels of inflammatory mediators (eg, IL-1, TNF-alpha).  In contrast, this patient's wound is 10 days out from surgery and most likely in the proliferation phase. $#(Choice B)#  Extensive collagen crosslinking, which increases the tensile strength of the wound, occurs during the final phase of wound healing, maturation.  Maturation typically occurs between 3 weeks and 1-2 years (not 10 days post-surgery). $#(Choice E)#  Collagen synthesis begins during the proliferation phase, along with angiogenesis.

Although risk of cutaneous SCC is increased by solar damage, chronic inflammation, and ionizing radiation, the primary driver of malignancy in this patient is likely the use of #immunosuppressive medications# (eg, tacrolimus, mycophenolate, prednisone). $The innate and adaptive immune responses play a crucial role in the control of neoplasms, as follows: $• Natural killer cells, a component of the innate immune system, destroy host cells with surface markers signaling damage or distress and cells deficient in self markers such as class I major histocompatibility complexes (MHC). $• Cytotoxic T-cells identify tumor neoantigens on the surface of cancer cells and destroy the cell with cytotoxic granules. $• Helper T-cells identify tumor neoantigens on the surface of antigen-presenting cells and secrete effector cytokines (eg, interferon gamma, tumor necrosis factor alpha) that promote anti-tumor immune activity. $Patients who are immunosuppressed from medications or infections (eg, HIV) are at increased risk for malignancy due to #reduced immunosurveillance# by natural killer cells and the cell-mediated immune response.  Reduced immunosurveillance allows malignant cells to avoid immunologic identification with fewer evasive adaptations; it also allows #oncogenic viruses# to replicate in an unchecked fashion, which can trigger malignancy. $#(Choice B)#  Peripheral T-cell tolerance (anergy) occurs when a T-cell binds to its complementary antigen on surface MHC molecules but does not undergo costimulation.  Cancer cells often overexpress molecules (eg, CTLA-4) that bind up surface proteins (CD80/86) required for T-cell costimulation, which increases (not decreases) peripheral T-cell tolerance. $#(Choice C)#  Telomeres are repetitive DNA sequences at the end of chromosomes that shorten progressively with cellular division, leading to chromosomal instability.  Most tumors increase (not decrease) the activity of telomerase, an enzyme that adds nucleotides to the telomere in order to counteract shortening. $#(Choice D)#  Tumors produce cytokines that impede the differentiation of monocytes to macrophages in the tumor microenvironment, which helps prevent phagocytosis and destruction of tumor cells. $#(Choice E)#  Tumor cells typically decrease (not increase) expression of class I MHC in order to reduce display of neoantigens on their surface; this limits the ability of cytotoxic T-cells to identify tumor antigens on the cell surface. $#Educational objective# Natural killer cells and the cell mediated immune response play a major role in cancer cell detection and destruction.  Therefore, patients who are immunocompromised from medication or infection are at much higher risk for cancer. ",

Correction of underlying lipid defects can lead to slow resolution of these lesions. $#(Choice A)#  Ankylosing spondylitis is an HLA-B27-associated spondyloarthropathy that affects primarily young males and causes debilitating pain and deformity of the spine and hips. $#(Choice B)#  Hemochromatosis ('bronze diabetes') can cause generalized darkening of the skin due to hemosiderin deposition as well as cutaneous stigmata associated with chronic liver disease (eg, palmar erythema, gynecomastia, spider telangiectasias). $#(Choice C)#  Graves' disease (the most common cause of hyperthyroidism) can present with pretibial myxedema and exophthalmos due to glycosaminoglycan accumulation.  However, glycosaminoglycan accumulation occurs within the retroorbital space (not over the eyelids).  In addition, hypothyroidism (not hyperthyroidism) is a common cause of hyperlipidemia. $#(Choice D)#  Peptic ulcer disease may occur in multiple endocrine neoplasia 1. $#(Choice E)#  Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease causes mild persistent proteinuria that can result in dyslipidemia.  However, this is a less common cause of xanthelasma than biliary cirrhosis. $#Educational objective# A yellowish eyelid papule or plaque containing lipid-laden macrophages is most likely xanthelasma.  Xanthelasma may occur in association with primary or secondary hyperlipidemia.  Cholestatic conditions such as primary biliary cholangitis are a potential cause of hypercholesterolemia leading to xanthelasma. ",

As in this patient, bullae are typically @tense@ and have erythematous or normal-appearing bases.  Lesion distribution can be localized or diffuse, involving the trunk and extremities; #mucosal involvement is rare#.  The pruritus preceding and associated with this condition can be severe. $BP is caused by #autoantibodies# against @hemidesmosomes@, structural components which anchor the basal layer of epithelial cells to the basement membrane.  These autoantibodies result in a destructive inflammatory cascade that causes the entire epidermis to separate from the dermis, forming #subepidermal blisters#.  In addition to skin biopsy for routine histology and immunofluorescence, serologic testing for autoantibodies against #hemidesmosome proteins# (eg, BP180, BP230) is also obtained to confirm the diagnosis. $#(Choice A)#  Connexins are proteins that form gap junctions, which allow small molecules and ions (eg, cyclic AMP, Na+) to pass between cells so that they may function in a coordinated manner (eg, contraction of cardiac myocytes). $#(Choice B)#  Autoantibodies directed at desmosome proteins (eg, desmogleins 1 and 3) cause pemphigus vulgaris, which presents with flaccid bullae that easily rupture and form @erosions@.  Mucosal involvement is almost always present. $#(Choice D)#  Integrins expressed on the cell surface of leukocytes are responsible for @diapedesis@ from the circulation into tissue. $#(Choice E)#  @Epidermolysis bullosa simplex@ is a mucocutaneous blistering disorder caused by genetic mutations of (not autoantibodies against) the proteins forming intermediate filaments (the major intracellular structural component of keratinocytes).  This condition typically presents early in life. $#Educational objective# Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is an autoimmune blistering disorder characterized by tense bullae in patients age >60.  Autoantibodies against hemidesmosome components initiate an inflammatory response that results in separation of the epidermis from the dermis, leading to subepidermal blisters. ",

  "explanation_2": "$#Dermatitis herpetiformis# (DH) is characterized by #erythematous pruritic papules, vesicles, and bullae# that appear symmetrically on the extensor surfaces (eg, elbows, knees), upper back, and buttocks.  Herpetiformis refers to the resemblance of the clustered vesicles to those of herpes simplex.  DH is characterized histologically by @microabscesses@ containing fibrin and neutrophils at the dermal papillae tips.  The overlying basal cells become vacuolated, and coalescing blisters form at the tips of the involved papillae.  Immunofluorescent imaging shows #deposition of IgA# at the dermoepidermal junction. $The pathogenesis of DH is associated with that of #celiac disease#.  Following absorption of dietary gluten, gliadin is deaminated by tissue transglutaminase in a process involving formation of covalent crosslinks between the two.  Because of this, the subsequent immune response against gliadin also targets tissue transglutaminase, leading to the production of IgA and IgG #tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies#.  In the skin, the IgA antibodies cross-react with epidermal transglutaminase, and the resulting inflammation leads to the characteristic manifestations of DH. $The majority of patients with DH exhibit the small-bowel histologic findings of celiac disease, which include: $• Small bowel @intraepithelial lymphocytosis@ $• Crypt hyperplasia (elongation) $• Progressive @villous atrophy@ (height shrinkage) $#(Choice A)#  Ulcerative colitis is characterized by mucosal inflammation, crypt abscesses (neutrophils in glandular lumen), and ulcerations.  Common dermal associations include @erythema nodosum@, @pyoderma gangrenosum@, and psoriasis.  The papulovesicular rash seen in this patient is not consistent with any of these entities. $#(Choice B)#  IgG-mediated skin disruption occurs in @pemphigus vulgaris@ and @bullous pemphigoid@.  These conditions are characterized by large bullae and ulcerations that are not confined to the extensor surfaces.  Pemphigus vulgaris may involve the pharynx and esophagus, but neither condition is associated with steatorrhea. $#(Choice D)#  Elevated urinary porphyrin levels (ie, uroporphyrin, heptacarboxyl porphyrin) are seen in @porphyria cutanea tarda@.  This condition is characterized by skin fragility and blistering lesions in sun-exposed areas.  Steatorrhea would be unexpected. $#(Choice E)#  Insulin resistance occurs in type 2 diabetes mellitus, which can be associated with @acanthosis nigricans@ and @necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum@.  Although celiac disease and DH are associated with other autoimmune disorders, including type 1 diabetes, there is no association with type 2 diabetes. $#Educational objective# Dermatitis herpetiformis is characterized by erythematous pruritic papules, vesicles, and bullae that appear symmetrically on extensor surfaces.  It is strongly associated with celiac disease, a disorder characterized histologically by small intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytosis, crypt hyperplasia, and villous atrophy. ",

The dermis, the connective tissue layer between the epidermis and subcutaneous tissue (ie, hypodermis), is composed of collagen, elastic fibers, and ground substance and contains extracellular components including nerves, vasculature, hair follicles, and glands.  @Neurofibromas@ are composed of a mixture of cells normally found in peripheral nerves, including #neoplastic Schwann cells#, as well as non-neoplastic fibroblasts, perineural cells, and mast cells. $Cutaneous neurofibromas most commonly appear around puberty and increase in size and number with age.

In addition, although the epidermis contains free nerve endings, these unencapsulated neuronal receptors lack the components (eg, Schwann cells, connective tissue) that typically give rise to neurofibromas. $#(Choice D)#  Superficial fibromatosis represents an infiltrative fibroblast proliferation within superficial fascia, which can lead to progressive fascial contracture and local deformity.  A classic example is @Dupuytren contracture@ (ie, palmar fibromatosis), which affects the palmar fascia. $#(Choice E)#  Most skeletal muscle neoplasms are malignant.  @Rhabdomyosarcomas@ are aggressive tumors that arise from primitive mesenchymal cells with skeletal muscle differentiation rather than from mature, terminally differentiated muscle cells.

Histologic examination of the affected epidermis would demonstrate the #absence of melanocytes# and melanin pigment. $The pathogenesis of melanocyte loss in vitiligo is likely a combination of #autoimmune activity#, neurohumoral toxicity specific for melanocytes, and melanocytic self-destruction (eg, toxic intermediate exposure during melanin synthesis).  Autoimmune activity seems to have the strongest correlation with vitiligo due to the presence of circulating melanocyte antibodies in patients and the high prevalence of concurrent autoimmune disorders (e.g., type I diabetes mellitus, pernicious anemia, Addison disease, autoimmune thyroiditis). $#(Choice B)#  Lentigines are small, benign pigmented lesions characterized by linear melanocytic hyperplasia. $#(Choice C)#  Café-au-lait spots demonstrate increased melanosome aggregates within the melanocyte cytoplasm.  These macules are hyperpigmented and associated with neurofibromatosis type 1. $#(Choice D)#  Postinflammatory hypopigmentation can occur after significant inflammatory skin lesions (eg, discoid lupus, psoriasis) and is characterized by redistribution of existing melanin within the skin and/or reduced transfer of melanin to keratinocytes. $#(Choice E)#  Individuals with albinism have melanocytes that do not produce melanin because of absent or defective tyrosinase. $#Educational objective# Vitiligo is a common condition characterized by the loss of epidermal melanocytes.  It occurs more commonly in patients with autoimmune disorders (eg, autoimmune thyroiditis, type I diabetes) and results in well-defined, variably sized patches of hypopigmentation. "

  "explanation_2": "$#Acne vulgaris# is a disorder of the #pilosebaceous follicle#.  Hyperkeratinization and obstruction of the follicle in combination with glandular enlargement and increased sebum production provides an optimal environment for Cutibacterium (Propionibacterium) acnes.  This organism metabolizes sebaceous lipids, releasing inflammatory factors that lead to follicular and perifollicular inflammation.  Acne is most common in areas with a high concentration of sebaceous follicles, including the face, back, chest, and upper arms. $#Androgens# stimulate production of sebum, and increased androgen levels (eg, puberty, polycystic ovary syndrome) increase the incidence of acne.  Obstruction of the glands, such as by #oil-based hair products# (pomade acne), also promotes acne.  In addition, #mechanical irritation #can promote acne by increasing glandular occlusion and disruption of follicles (acne mechanica).  #Sports participation#, as in this patient, frequently triggers acne due to the use of tight-fitting clothing (eg, sports bras) and protective gear (eg, helmets). $#(Choice A)#  High ambient temperatures can worsen acne, leading to formation of painful nodules on the trunk (tropical acne).

This condition begins acutely, resolves spontaneously within 1-2 weeks, and typically involves the skin under a bathing suit (eg, buttocks) or on the extremities. $#(Choice C)#  Obesity is associated with an increased risk of acne, but weight loss generally does not worsen acne. $#(Choice D)#  Typical oral contraceptives do not promote acne.  Rather, many commonly used contraceptives can reduce acne due to decreased synthesis of androgens. $#Educational objective# Risk factors for acne include increased androgen levels; obstruction of pilosebaceous glands by oil-based hair products; and mechanical irritation of skin follicles.

Six weeks after primary repair, this patient's intact, healed wound is most likely undergoing #remodeling# (also called maturation), the final phase of wound healing that occurs between approximately #3 weeks and 2 years#. $#Matrix metalloproteinases# (MMPs) play a pivotal role in the wound-remodeling phase.  Secreted by several different cell types (eg, fibroblasts, macrophages, neutrophils, some epithelial cells), MMPs facilitate the degradation of collagen and other proteins in the extracellular matrix in a highly regulated fashion.  This occurs so that #type III# collagen laid down in a rapid, disorganized manner during the proliferation phase can be #replaced by type I collagen#, now arranged in well-organized, parallel bundles with extensive cross-linking.

Cytokines released by activated platelets and damaged cells lead to migration of neutrophils (within the first 24 hours) and macrophages (2-3 days later) to the damaged area. $#2. The proliferative phase# begins 3-5 days after the injury.  Fibroblasts and endothelial vascular cells proliferate to form connective tissue and blood vessels (neovascularization), respectively.  Around this time, epithelial cells begin to proliferate at the dermal edges and secrete basement membrane material. $#3. The maturation phase# is characterized by fibrosis (scar formation) and starts during the second week after injury.  During this phase, active fibroblasts synthesize collagen, elastin, and other components of the connective tissue matrix. $During the healing process, fibroblast migration and proliferation are controlled by multiple growth factors including platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and #transforming growth factor-β# (TGF-β).  TGF-β is also critical for stimulating connective tissue synthesis and remodeling of the extracellular matrix.  TGF-β typically decreases during the maturation phase of wound healing to limit the amount of collagenous scar tissue.  Hypertrophic or disfiguring scars can be caused by persistently elevated TGF-β, which leads to increased fibroblast proliferation and activity.  In addition, the fibroblasts in hypertrophic scars often have altered TGF-β signaling due to increased TGF-β receptor expression. $#(Choice A)#  Interferon-β is an antiviral cytokine that also decreases inflammatory cell movement across the blood-brain barrier.

Because 'pigmentation' is not among the answer choices, glomus tumor is the most likely diagnosis. $A glomangioma is a tumor of the modified smooth muscle cells of a glomus body.  Glomus bodies are numerous small, encapsulated neurovascular organs found in the dermis of the nail bed, the pads of the fingers and toes, and the ears.  Each glomus body is composed of an afferent arteriole connected to a richly innervated, muscular arteriovenous anastomosis, which is then connected to an efferent vein.  Modified smooth muscle cells are arranged in layers around these vascular channels.  The role of the glomus body is to shunt blood away from the skin surface in cold temperatures in order to prevent heat loss, and to direct blood flow to the skin surface in hot environments to facilitate the dissipation of heat. $#(Choice A)#  Extremity receptors responsible for proprioception include muscle spindles, Golgi tendon organs, Pacinian corpuscles, and cutaneous touch receptors (including Meissner's corpuscles, Merkel's disks, and free nerve endings).  A tumor of any component of these structures (e.g. neurons, connective tissue cells) would not have a bluish coloration. $#(Choice B)#  Light touch is mediated by cutaneous mechanoreceptors, which may be encapsulated or free nerve endings. # #A tumor of these structures would not have a blue hue. $#(Choice D)#  A lymphangioma is a tumor of the cells involved in lymphatic drainage.  These benign lymphatic neoplasms are analogous to vascular hemangiomas.  Lymphangiomas tend to occur subepidermally, in the head, neck, and axilla.  They consist of networks of endothelium-lined lymph spaces.  Because they do not contain pigmented cells or red blood cells, lymphangiomas would be unlikely to have a bluish appearance. $#(Choice E)#  A tumor of antigen-processing cells would be either a histiocytosis or a lymphoma.  When there is cutaneous involvement in Langerhans cell histiocytosis, patients present with erythematous papules, nodules, and/or scaling plaques.  B-cell lymphomas very rarely involve the skin. $#(Choice F)#  The basal epidermal cells of the nail matrix are responsible for nail growth.  Tumors originating from the epidermis include squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) and basal cell carcinomas (BCC).  SCC does not involve pigmented cells.  Although BCC may involve pigmented cells, the majority of these lesions (85%) appear on the head and neck; BCC rarely affects the dorsum of the hands. $#Educational objective# A benign glomus tumor (glomangioma) can produce a very tender, small (a few millimeters in diameter), red-blue lesion under the nail bed.  This type of tumor originates from the modified smooth muscle cells that control the thermoregulatory functions of dermal glomus bodies.  "

Light-skinned individuals are at greatest risk. $On gross inspection, @melanomas@ are characterized by asymmetric shape, irregular or jagged border, variability of color (brown, black, red, blue, or unpigmented), diameter >0.5 cm, and evolution in size and appearance over time (#ABCDE criteria#).  Histologically, @melanoma cells@ congregate in poorly formed nests and are large with irregular nuclei, clumped chromatin, and prominent nucleoli. $In early development, many melanomas exhibit a radial growth phase.  This superficial, horizontal growth within the epidermis and superficial dermis carries a very low risk of metastatic spread #(choice A)#.  In contrast, melanomas in the #vertical growth phase# contain melanoma cells that travel downward into the deeper dermal layers, #increasing metastatic risk#.  Vertical growth often corresponds to a palpable nodularity of the lesion.  The #Breslow depth# (distance from the epidermal granular cell layer to the deepest visible melanoma cells) is the most important prognostic indicator in malignant melanoma. $#(Choice C)#  A dense lymphocytic infiltration of the tumor suggests a robust immune response and is thought to improve prognosis. $#(Choice D)#  Multinucleated giant melanocytes are a characteristic finding in lentigo maligna melanoma.  @Lentigo maligna@ are common pigmented lesions in elderly patients and are considered to be a type of melanoma in-situ.  When melanoma develops in lentigo maligna, the prognosis is similar to other melanomas of the same stage. $#(Choice E)#  Prominent cellular atypia is a classic finding of malignant melanoma, but it is not considered the most important risk factor for metastatic disease. $#Educational objective# Melanoma often has an early horizontal growth phase with low metastatic potential followed by a nodular, vertical growth phase with a significantly increased risk of metastasis.  Depth of invasion (Breslow thickness) is the most important prognostic indicator in malignant melanoma.  ",

ARF is a multisystem complication that develops 2-4 weeks after untreated group A streptococcal pharyngitis.  Most organs are often only mildly and transiently affected in ARF, with the exception of the heart.  Acute morbidity is most likely due to pancarditis (inflammation of the endocardium, myocardium, and epicardium).

Severe regurgitation and/or #myocarditis# can lead to cardiac dilation, #heart failure#, and death in a small percentage of patients. $#(Choice A)#  Virtually all cases of mitral stenosis are caused by fibrosis of the valve leaflets in chronic rheumatic heart disease.  The fibrosis occurs gradually over years or decades after the initial episode of ARF and would, therefore, not be an acute complication in this patient. $#(Choice C)#  Acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) is caused by circulating immune complexes following a streptococcal pharyngeal infection with specific nephritogenic strains.  Hematuria, edema, proteinuria, and hypertension are classic findings.  This patient has no symptoms of PSGN, which rarely occurs simultaneously with ARF. $#(Choice D)#  Patients with septic arthritis are often febrile and ill-appearing.  Staphylococcus aureus is the most common cause and usually infects only one joint. $#(Choice E)#  Septic shock refers to end-organ damage due to poor perfusion from an overwhelming inflammatory response to infection.  Although the pathogenesis of ARF involves an initial infection with group A streptococcus, the disease itself is autoimmune-related, not due to direct infection. $#Educational objective# The primary cause of morbidity in acute rheumatic fever is heart failure from severe pancarditis.

  "explanation_2": "$This child has acute-onset #fever#, malaise, and #refusal to bear weight#, findings concerning for #osteomyelitis#.  Older children often have focal bony tenderness, but children age ≤2 may be unable to localize pain.  Passive range of motion of the joints typically is normal and helps distinguish osteomyelitis from septic arthritis. $The most common cause of osteomyelitis in #children# is #hematogenous spread# of bacteria, which may be introduced by minor (often unnoticed) trauma to a distant site.  Infection in children classically occurs in the #metaphyses# of #long bones# (eg, femur, tibia) because this region is highly vascular yet contains #slow-flowing sinusoids# that are conducive to bacterial seeding.  Bacterial seeding within the metaphysis initially causes #acute inflammation# of the bone marrow, with focal hyperperfusion and #increased radiotracer uptake# within the affected region. $Persistent inflammation within the confined bony space leads to increased intramedullary pressure, which compromises blood flow and forces infectious exudate into the cortex and periosteum.  Without treatment, the infection can progress to chronic suppurative osteomyelitis, in which necrotic bone (ie, sequestrum) serves as an infectious reservoir and sinus tracts develop to drain away the purulent material. $#(Choice A)#  Osteomyelitis of flat bones (eg, skull, pelvis) is uncommon in children and is typically caused by contiguous spread of infection (eg, open wound, dental abscess).  Although pelvic bone involvement may lead to refusal to bear weight, this patient has no gross abnormality of the hips or lower extremities suggesting adjacent soft tissue infection. $#(Choice B)#  Ewing sarcoma typically arises in diaphysis of the long bones, especially the femur.  It is the second most common malignant bone tumor in children after osteosarcoma.  However, Ewing sarcoma typically presents in children age >10 with an insidious onset of progressive pain, not in toddlers with acute refusal to bear weight. $#(Choice C)#  The physis (growth plate) in children limits vascular connections between the metaphysis and epiphysis, which is relatively less vascularized, making epiphyseal involvement uncommon in hematogenous osteomyelitis.  Although avascular necrosis of the proximal femoral epiphysis (eg, Legg-Calve-Perthes) can present with a limp, the pain is typically more mild and develops gradually without fever. $#(Choice E)#  Hematogenous osteomyelitis in adults occurs more commonly in the vertebral bodies due to increasing vertebral vascularity with age as well as epiphyseal closure during puberty (improves capillary flow within the metaphyses of long bones). $#Educational objective# Hematogenous osteomyelitis occurs most commonly in children.  It usually affects the metaphysis of long bones due to the presence of slow-flowing sinusoids that are conducive to bacterial seeding.  Fever and refusal to bear weight are common manifestations in young children who are unable to localize the pain.  "

In light of her age and post-menopausal status, this is likely due to #osteoporosis#.  After menopause, declining estrogen levels accelerate the loss of bone mass with a decrease in osteoblastic and an increase in osteoclastic activity.  Other common risk factors include low body weight, smoking, heavy alcohol intake, and sedentary lifestyle. $The 2 major types of bone are trabecular (also called cancellous or spongy bone) and cortical.  #Trabecular bone# composes only 15% of the skeleton by weight but is metabolically more active due to its large surface area.  Initially following menopause, bone loss predominantly affects trabecular bone, especially in the dorsolumbar vertebral bodies.  Morphologic characteristics include #trabecular thinning# and perforation with #loss of interconnecting bridges#.  With continued aging, cortical bone, which composes most of the appendicular skeleton, also becomes involved.  The neck of the femur has components of both trabecular and cortical bone, and is a common site of osteoporotic fracture. $#(Choice A)#  Paget disease of bone is caused by defective osteoid formation and increased bone remodeling.  Collagen is laid down in a haphazard manner, resulting in a mosaic pattern of bone with irregular sections of lamellar bone linked by prominent cement lines.  Paget disease typically presents with bone pain and deformity with osteolytic or mixed lytic/sclerotic lesions on x-ray. $#(Choice B)#  Osteomalacia is commonly due to vitamin D deficiency, and is characterized by unmineralized osteoid deposits on trabecular surfaces.  The bone is weak and prone to fracture, but symptomatic patients typically have bone pain, muscle weakness, and impaired ambulation. $#(Choice C)#  Osteopetrosis is a group of disorders characterized by impaired osteoclast function.  This leads to persistence of the primary spongiosa in the medullary cavity.  These rare disorders typically present early in life with fractures, deformities, and hematologic cytopenias (due to obliteration of the marrow space). $#(Choice D)#  Bone disease in hyperparathyroidism is characterized by increased bone resorption in cortical bone with subperiosteal thinning and cystic degeneration (osteitis fibrosa cystica).  However, this is typically seen in advanced cases along with diffuse bone pain and manifestations of hypercalcemia (eg, constipation, neuropsychiatric symptoms). $#Educational objective# Initially in osteoporosis, bone loss predominantly affects trabecular bone, leading to trabecular thinning and perforation with loss of interconnecting bridges.

LEMS is an immune-mediated disorder of the neuromuscular junction characterized by #autoantibodies# directed at the #presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channel#, resulting in decreased acetylcholine release and muscle weakness.  LEMS is strongly associated with #small cell lung cancer#, likely due to the immune recognition of voltage-gated calcium channels that are present on the malignant cells. $Patients typically develop progressive #proximal muscle weakness# that manifests in the form of gait alteration and difficulty arising from a chair or climbing stairs.  #Autonomic symptoms#, such as dry mouth or impotence, are common.  Cranial nerve (particularly ptosis) and respiratory muscle involvement may occur but typically manifest later in the disease course.

LEMS is strongly associated with small cell lung cancer.  ",

  "explanation_2": "$This patient has progressive hip pain and unilateral headaches associated with an elevated serum alkaline phosphatase level.  In a patient age >50, these findings suggest #Paget disease# of bone (osteitis deformans).  Paget disease is a chronic disorder characterized by #excessive and disordered bone formation#. $Involvement of the skull can manifest with frontal bossing, #headache#, increased hat size, and impingement on cranial nerves (eg, vestibulocochlear nerve [CN VIII], presenting with hearing loss).  Involvement of long bones can lead to bowing, fracture, or #arthritis# of adjacent joints.  Vertebral lesions can cause spinal stenosis or radiculopathy.  Increased blood flow in pagetic lesions can be apparent as local warmth or #bruit# and can occasionally lead to high-output heart failure.  The increased formation of new bone is associated with an #elevated serum alkaline phosphatase#, but calcium and phosphorus levels remain normal. $#(Choices A and C)#  Hyperparathyroidism can cause bone pain, often associated with symptomatic hypercalcemia (eg, constipation).  Osteomalacia can cause bone pain and pathologic fractures typically affecting weight-bearing bones (eg, pelvis, lower extremities).  Serum alkaline phosphatase may be increased in these conditions but headaches with normal calcium and phosphorus levels are more suggestive of Paget disease. $#(Choice B)#  This patient is at increased risk for malignancy due to his significant smoking history (ie, 30-pack-years and comorbid chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).  A primary bone malignancy (eg, osteosarcoma) involving the femur might cause hip pain and elevated alkaline phosphatase, but secondary involvement of the skull would be unlikely.  Metastatic cancer could explain the patient's symptoms but would often be associated with hypercalcemia and systemic symptoms (eg, weight loss).  This patient's presentation is more typical of Paget disease. $#(Choice D)#  Infectious osteomyelitis tends to be localized to one focus of infection and does not typically cause elevation of alkaline phosphatase.  Fevers and leukocytosis are common. $#(Choice E)#  Osteoporosis may cause hip pain because of a pathological fracture, but cranial involvement is rare and alkaline phosphatase is normal. $#Educational objective# Paget disease of bone is characterized by excessive and disordered bone formation.

  "explanation_2": "This patient with chronic back and buttock pain associated with stiffness has #ankylosing spondylitis# (AS).  The symptoms are characteristically worse with rest (eg, in the morning, overnight) and improve with stretching and warm showers.  AS is most common in men age <40, and inflammatory markers (eg, erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) are usually elevated. $AS is characterized by simultaneous erosion of bone and new bone formation, unlike rheumatoid arthritis in which only erosions occur.  The initial pathogenesis is driven in part by inflammatory cytokines (eg, tumor necrosis factor, IL-17), which cause activation of osteoclast precursor cells and #bony erosions#.  This occurs primarily in the vertebral bodies and results in destruction of the trabecular microarchitecture, increasing the risk for secondary osteoporosis and compression fractures. $Once inflammation subsides, the reparative process leads to #excessive new bone formation#, especially in areas where fat metaplasia fills previously eroded sites; in contrast to erosion, bone formation occurs primarily at the periosteum-cartilage junction and manifests as @bridging syndesmophytes@ in the vertebral column.  This leads to #spinal rigidity#, postural alterations, and increased risk of fracture. $#(Choice B)#  @Paget disease@ of bone is characterized by excessive and disordered bone formation, with focal thickening of trabecular and cortical bone.  Features include bone pain, fractures, and arthritis of adjacent joints.  However, it is uncommon at age <50, and this patient's inflammatory back pain is more consistent with AS. $#(Choice C)#  @Fibrous dysplasia@ (FD) is a benign tumor characterized by focal bone dysplasia (ie, failure of normal differentiation) and shows irregular trabeculae of immature bone in a fibrous stroma with spindle cells.  It is typically asymptomatic and detected incidentally on imaging (eg, @ground glass lesion@), commonly in the femur and tibia.  FD is usually seen in children and is not an inflammatory condition (ie, normal ESR). $#(Choice D)#  Intervertebral disc protrusion and thickening of the ligamentum flava can lead to @spinal stenosis@.  The pain in this disorder typically radiates to the posterior thighs and legs and is relieved by sitting and flexion of the spine, not activity.  Spinal stenosis is usually seen at age >60, and ESR is normal. $#(Choice E)#  @Multiple myeloma@ is characterized by plasmacytic infiltrates in the bone marrow.  Patients often have @lytic bone lesions@ throughout the axial skeleton and back pain at night and during rest, but stiffness is less prominent.  Multiple myeloma is uncommon before age 50. $#Educational objective# Ankylosing spondylitis is an inflammatory spondyloarthropathy characterized by simultaneous erosion of bone and new bone formation.  Bone erosions occur primarily in vertebral bodies; however, new bone formation typically occurs at the junction of the periosteal margin and adjacent cartilage, leading to bridging syndesmophytes and ankylosis.

Because PAN is not associated with antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies or significant elevation in antinuclear antibodies, diagnostic confirmation usually requires tissue biopsy. $#(Choices A and C)#  Bacterial endocarditis can cause embolic septic infarctions in the kidneys and intestines.  Inherited coagulation disorders can also cause thrombosis with tissue infarctions.  However, biopsy would show a clot/embolism in the arterial lumen (during acute infarction), not transmural inflammation and connective tissue proliferation. $#(Choice B)#  Granulomatosis with polyangiitis usually causes manifestations in the upper/lower airways (eg, rhinosinusitis, hemoptysis) and kidneys (eg, glomerulonephritis).  The gastrointestinal tract is not typically affected.  Furthermore, biopsy generally reveals a leukocytoclastic vasculitis with minimal or no luminal narrowing or fibrinoid necrosis. $#(Choice E)#  Thromboangiitis obliterans occurs primarily in young smokers.  It is marked by inflammatory thrombi in the small- and medium-sized vessels of the extremities.  Patients usually have digital ulcers, ischemia, gangrene, or limb claudication.  Mesenteric and renal infarction would be atypical.  In addition, transmural inflammation/connective tissue proliferation would not be seen during the acute stage of infarction. $#Educational objective# Polyarteritis nodosa is a systemic vasculitis of medium-sized muscular arteries marked by segmental, transmural, arterial wall inflammation with fibrinoid necrosis.  This narrows the arterial lumen and increases risk of thrombosis and tissue ischemia/infarction.  Damage to the internal and external elastic laminae also increases the risk of microaneurysm.

RA is a progressive autoimmune disorder that is often associated with signs of systemic inflammation (eg, fatigue, fever, anemia).  It has a peak incidence at age 50-75 but can occur at any age; women are affected more commonly than men. $The pathogenesis of RA begins with activation of T lymphocytes in response to rheumatoid antigens (eg, citrullinated peptides, type II collagen).  Activated T cells release cytokines that cause #synovial hyperplasia# with recruitment of additional mononuclear cells.  The accelerated metabolic rate of the inflamed synovial tissue leads to #local hypoxia# and increased production of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 and vascular endothelial growth factor by local macrophages and fibroblasts, resulting in #synovial angiogenesis# (neovascularization). $As the disease progresses, new blood vessels provide nutrients that facilitate expansion of inflamed synovium into a #rheumatoid pannus#, an invasive mass composed of fibroblast-like synovial cells, granulation tissue, and inflammatory cells.  Over time, the pannus encroaches into the joint space and can destroy the articular cartilage and erode the underlying subchondral bone #(choice C)#.

Although this disorder is common in the knee, chronic arthritis without signs of acute synovitis is more consistent with osteoarthritis. $#(Choice C)#  Hemochromatosis can cause deposition of iron salts within the synovium and joint space, which can lead to a chronic arthritis resembling osteoarthritis.  Although hereditary hemochromatosis is associated with diabetes mellitus, this patient lacks other characteristic findings (eg, skin pigmentation, liver dysfunction, cardiac enlargement); in addition, osteoarthritis is a much more common cause of arthritis in the general population. $#(Choice D)#  Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory arthritis associated with synovial hyperplasia.  It most commonly affects the proximal interphalangeal (PIP), metacarpophalangeal (MCP), wrist, knee, and ankle joints.  However, patients typically have symmetric joint involvement and prolonged morning stiffness. $#(Choice E)#  Parvovirus B19 presents in adults as a nonspecific flulike illness, often followed by a symmetric arthritis most commonly affecting the hands.  Symptoms are acute and resolve within a few weeks. $#Educational objective# Osteoarthritis is characterized by progressive fissuring and erosion of articular cartilage.

Clinical manifestations are variable and can range from mild defects to lethal disease in utero.  In most patients, OI is transmitted by autosomal dominant inheritance. $#Type 1 collagen# is the predominant collagen in #osteoid #(organic portion of bone matrix) and allows bone to be somewhat flexible while still maintaining strength.  Type 1 collagen is also present in teeth, ligaments, skin, and sclerae.  In OI, deficiency of type 1 collagen causes brittle bones that are prone to fracture.  Other manifestations include #blue sclerae# due to the deficient connective tissue allowing transparency of underlying vessels and #small, malformed teeth# (@dentinogenesis imperfecta@).  Joints can have excessive laxity, and some patients are also susceptible to bruising and hearing loss. $#(Choice A)#  Bones are formed by endochondral ossification (eg, long bones) and intramembranous ossification (eg, flat bones).  Endochondral ossification involves the deposition of hyaline cartilage by chondrocytes and is impaired in achondroplasia, which is unlikely in a patient of normal stature. $#(Choice B)#  Bone matrix comprises inorganic (eg, hydroxyapatite crystals) and organic (eg, type 1 collagen) components.  Osteoblasts release calcium-binding proteins (eg, osteocalcin) and phosphatases that promote bone mineralization.  Defective mineralization of bone matrix is a characteristic feature of vitamin D deficiency. $#(Choice D)#  Bone remodeling strengthens and repairs bone through the removal of old bone by osteoclasts and replacement with new bone by osteoblasts.  Impaired remodeling leads to osteopetrosis (denser but more fragile bones).  Pathologic fractures can occur, but blue sclerae are not associated with this disorder. $#(Choice E)#  Long bones have multiple arteries that are essential for growth and maintenance.  If the blood supply to the epiphysis is disrupted, the bone dies, resulting in avascular necrosis (eg, Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease).  Avascular necrosis typically presents with pain and limited mobility but not pathologic fractures. $#Educational objective# Osteogenesis imperfecta results from defective synthesis of type 1 collagen by osteoblasts.

'CREST' is an acronym for the signs and symptoms: #C#alcinosis, #R#aynaud's phenomenon, #E#sophageal dysmotility, #S#clerodactyly and #T#elangiectasias.  Anti-centromere antibodies are specific for CREST syndrome and found in 40% of cases.  Anti-DNA topoisomerase I (Scl-70) antibodies are highly specific for systemic sclerosis (diffuse scleroderma). $The patient in the vignette has CREST syndrome.  #Raynaud's phenomenon #causes painful episodes of pallor, cyanosis, and erythema of the hands in response to cold or emotional stress.  These episodes of vasospasm can last minutes to hours.  #Esophageal dysmotility# is the result of fibrosis of the distal esophagus with associated esophageal hypomotility.  It manifests with symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux (heartburn and regurgitation).  #Sclerodactyly# is thickening of the skin of the hands and feet.  It begins as non-pitting edema of the hands and fingers.  Later in the course of the disease, the skin becomes thickened, tight and shiny.  Thinning of the skin (atrophy) follows.  #Telangiectasias# (dilated blood vessels) occur on the skin of the face, hands and upper trunk, and on mucosal surfaces.  #Calcinosis #refers to subcutaneous calcium deposits which may be asymptomatic or painful. $#(Choice A)#  Anti-dsDNA antibodies are specific for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Patients with SLE commonly have a malar ('butterfly') facial rash that worsens with sun exposure.  Patients also complain of low-grade fever, joint swelling and/or tenderness, and oral ulcers. $#(Choice C )#  Anti-histone antibodies are found in drug-induced lupus.  Procainamide, hydralazine, isoniazid, and D-penicillamine are common causes of drug-induced lupus.  Symptoms resemble those of SLE, but without renal or CNS involvement. $#(Choice D)#  Anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibodies are found in patients with Sjogren syndrome.  This condition is characterized by keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eyes) and xerostomia (dry mouth).  There may also be parotid gland enlargement, increased risk of other autoimmune diseases, and increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphomas. $#(Choice E)#  Anti-phospholipid antibodies are found in patients with SLE and in antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.  Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome causes a hypercoagulable state and patients may suffer recurrent miscarriages.  Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is paradoxically increased in these patients despite the propensity toward thrombosis. $#Educational objective# CREST syndrome (limited scleroderma) manifests with calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly and telangiectasias.

However, this patient has had no recent injuries, and osteoarthritis is unlikely to cause fever and such acute and severe knee pain, swelling, and restricted range of motion. $#(Choice B)#  Rheumatoid factor assay can aid in the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).  Although RA can cause joint pain, erythema, and restricted range of motion, joint involvement is more commonly symmetric and polyarticular (eg, ≥3 joints), with an insidious (vs acute) onset of symptoms. $#(Choice C)#  Serum ferritin levels are used in the diagnosis of hemochromatosis, which can cause arthritis due to iron deposition in the articular cartilage and synovium; however, the onset of joint pain is typically gradual (vs acute), and the hand metacarpophalangeal joints (particularly the second and third joints) are usually affected first. $#(Choice D)#  Synovial fluid crystal analysis, not a serum uric acid level, is the definitive test for gout because serum uric acid levels may be normal during an acute gout attack.  In addition, serum uric acid levels do not rule out other important causes of monoarthritis such as septic arthritis. $#Educational objective# Acute monoarthritis is characterized by pain, erythema, swelling, and reduced range of motion in a joint.  It may represent serious pathology such as septic arthritis, especially if accompanied by fever.  Urgent synovial fluid analysis should be performed to evaluate for infection.  "

  "explanation_2": "$Muscular dystrophy is a term that applies to the various diseases that manifest with progressive muscular weakness.  #Deletions# of the dystrophin gene that encodes the #dystrophin# protein on X chromosome p21 are the most common mutation in #Duchenne muscular dystrophy# (DMD) and Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD).  Deletions that are not a multiple of 3 change the reading frame, causing a #frameshift mutation#, which results in a nonfunctional protein and severe clinical manifestations (DMD).  In contrast, deletions that are a multiple of 3 base pairs preserve the reading frame, resulting in a truncated but functional protein and a milder clinical phenotype (BMD). $Dystrophin is a structural component of skeletal muscle fibers that provides mechanical stability to the sarcolemma.  It #links# a component of the #cytoskeleton# (actin) to #transmembrane proteins# (α- and β-dystrophiglycans) that are connected to the extracellular matrix.  Loss of dystrophin results in cellular injury (myonecrosis).  On light microscopy, there is segmental degeneration and regeneration of the myofibers with marked variation in size (both atrophic and hypertrophic fibers).  Over time, the muscle tissue undergoes progressive fatty replacement. $On clinical examination, the presence of #Gowers sign# and calf enlargement in a boy age 2-5 is classic for DMD.  Calf hypertrophy allows affected children to overcome proximal muscle weakness, but it is later replaced by fat and connective tissue (#pseudohypertrophy#).  The Gowers sign involves the use of one's hands to rise from a squat or from a chair to compensate for proximal muscle weakness. $#(Choice A)#  Endomysial inflammatory infiltration is found on muscle biopsy in polymyositis.  Dermatomyositis is associated with perifascicular inflammation.  Both diseases cause proximal muscle weakness but not distal muscle hypertrophy. $#(Choice B)#  Endoneural inflammatory infiltration is characteristic of Guillain-Barré syndrome, which classically manifests as ascending flaccid paralysis and hyporeflexia. $#(Choice C)#  Examples of ion channel myopathies include hyper- and hypokalemic periodic paralysis, which present with episodic, painless muscle weakness. $#(Choice D)#  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is due to mutation of the genes responsible for myelin synthesis.  Affected patients frequently present with distal muscle weakness, sensory loss, and atrophy of the calf muscles (producing the characteristic stork leg deformity). $#(Choice F)#  Mutations involving sarcomere proteins are responsible for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and certain forms of familial dilated cardiomyopathy. $#Educational objective# Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an X-linked recessive myopathy that manifests with proximal muscle weakness and enlargement of the calf muscles in boys age 2-5.  It most often results from frameshift deletions affecting the dystrophin gene.  Dystrophin provides a stabilizing interaction between the sarcolemma and the intracellular contraction apparatus, and disruption of the protein results in membrane damage and myonecrosis.  "

Her @x-ray@ reveals a pathological fracture through the left hip in the region of fibrous dysplasia. $MAS results from a mosaic somatic mutation during embryogenesis in the GNAS gene, which encodes the stimulatory α subunit of G protein.  This mutation causes constitutive activation of the G protein/cAMP/adenylate cyclase signaling cascade, which leads to a gain of function of the affected cells.  Persistent G-protein stimulatory activity in melanocytes results in prominent #café-au-lait macules# (CALMs).  CALMs, usually the first manifestation of MAS, are often large and unilateral with an irregular, 'coast of Maine' border. $In addition, autonomous endocrine function most commonly results in #precocious puberty# (onset of secondary sexual development before age 8 in girls).  The mutation also results in increased proliferation of fibroblast-like cells, increased secretion of IL-6, and activation of osteoclasts (#fibrous dysplasia#).  The term polyostotic refers to the presence of lesions in many bones, although they are typically unilateral. $#(Choice A)#  Ewing sarcoma typically presents with chronic pain and swelling affecting one of the long bones of the extremities or pelvis (ie, a single lesion).  Multiple layers of periosteal reaction result in a characteristic 'onion peel' appearance on x-ray. $#(Choice B)#  Gaucher disease is an inherited lysosomal storage disease that is most common among Ashkenazi Jews and may also result in diffuse, painful lytic bone lesions.

  "explanation_2": "@Vitamin D@ is derived from food and generated in the skin due to sunlight exposure (ie, conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholecalciferol).  Endogenous production from sunlight accounts for approximately half of daily requirements (~200-400 IU/day [required: 600]).  The dietary share is usually obtained primarily from fortified dairy/dairy-alternative foods; oily fish (eg, salmon, herring) is also an abundant source.  Other foods contain vitamin D but are often insufficient to meet requirements. $#Vitamin D deficiency# reduces intestinal absorption of calcium.

Radiographs of growth plates (eg, distal ulna) often reveal @metaphyseal plate widening@ and cupping. $#(Choice A)#  Glucocorticoids (eg, prednisone) cause osteoporosis because they inhibit proliferation and differentiation of osteoblast precursors and increase apoptosis of mature osteoblasts.  Fragility fractures may occur, but this patient's deformities are more consistent with rickets. $#(Choice B)#  The early osteolytic phase of @Paget disease@ of bone is characterized by proliferation of abnormally large, hypernucleated osteoclasts.  Paget disease causes bone pain and deformity (eg, frontal bossing, bowing of long bones) but findings are typically focal and asymmetric and usually occur in adults age >50. $#(Choice C)#  Replacement of bone with disorganized fibrous connective tissue (fibrous dysplasia) can occur in a single bone (eg, femur) or multiple bones (polyostotic).  Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia (@McCune-Albright syndrome@) is typically associated with café au lait macules and pituitary endocrine disorders (eg, precocious puberty, thyrotoxicosis, acromegaly). $#(Choice D)#  Osteosarcoma, the most common malignant bone tumor in children, is characterized by excessive production of mineralized bone.

  "explanation_2": "This patient has #hypertrophic osteoarthropathy# (HOA), a syndrome characterized by painful bone and soft tissue enlargement in the distal extremities.  Manifestations of HOA include @clubbing@ (enlargement of the distal phalanges with flattening of the nail fold), #painful arthropathy#, periostosis (tender thickening of the periosteum) of long bones, and joint effusions. $HOA commonly occurs in the setting of pulmonary malignancy, primarily #adenocarcinoma#, which characteristically arises in the lung periphery and is the most common primary lung cancer in nonsmokers.  HOA can also occur with lung metastasis, certain nonmalignant lung disorders (eg, cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis), and cyanotic heart disease. $Under normal conditions, #megakaryocytes# released from the bone marrow migrate to the pulmonary circulation, where fragmentation releases platelets into the bloodstream.  However, in HOA, disruption of the normal pulmonary circulation leads to arteriovenous shunting and allows megakaryocytes to bypass the lungs into the systemic circulation.

This is characteristic of #muscle reinnervation after denervation#.  Skeletal muscle fibers are categorized into @2 major types@: $• #Type I fibers# (slow-twitch) specialize in stamina by using oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria for steady and sustained ATP production.  The high content of myoglobin gives these fibers a red color. $• #Type II fibers# (fast-twitch) specialize in rapid bursts of strength by using anaerobic glycolysis.  The lower quantities of mitochondria and myoglobin lead to a pale color. $Muscle fibers are arranged into a #motor unit# composed of the #same fiber type#, with each unit innervated by a single motor neuron.  On histologic section, these motor units form a characteristic mixed #checkerboard pattern# of type I and type II fibers. $When muscle denervation first takes place, there is atrophy of both types of muscle fibers.  The affected myocytes then stimulate nearby nerves to undergo #collateral sprouting# to reinnervate the muscle fibers, which usually results in #adjacent muscle fibers# being innervated by the #same neuron#.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient has #bacterial vaginosis# (BV), an alteration in the normal vaginal flora associated with loss of lactobacilli and #overgrowth of anaerobes#, particularly the gram-variable rod #Gardnerella vaginalis#.  Although BV is not a sexually transmitted infection, it is associated with sexual activity (due to alterations of the vaginal flora from semen or contraceptives [eg, spermicide]). $Patients with BV commonly have a #thin, gray or clear# malodorous vaginal discharge.  The discharge's odor becomes more prominent when #potassium hydroxide (KOH)# is added to a sample (#whiff test#) because of the volatilization of #amines# produced by G vaginalis and other anaerobes.  #Clue cells# on wet mount microscopy are also characteristic. $#Clindamycin# and #metronidazole# are effective treatments for BV.  Clindamycin is a bacteriostatic drug that inhibits protein translation by binding to the 50s ribosomal subunit.  Metronidazole is bactericidal and damages the DNA of anaerobes; it is typically avoided with concurrent use of alcohol due to a disulfiram-like reaction (eg, vomiting, flushing). $#(Choice A)#  Chlamydia trachomatis is an intracellular, gram-negative bacterium that can infect the columnar epithelium of the cervix (eg, cervicitis) and urethra, in addition to the lungs and eyes.  Diagnosis is with nucleic acid amplification testing, and treatment is with azithromycin, a bacteriostatic macrolide antibiotic. $#(Choice B)#  Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a gram-negative diplococcus that infects the genital mucosa (eg, cervicitis, urethritis) and is diagnosed with gram stain of discharge or nucleic acid amplification testing.  It is treated with ceftriaxone (a third-generation cephalosporin that inhibits cell wall biosynthesis) monotherapy in the setting of negative testing for Chlamydia, and ceftriaxone plus doxycycline when Chlamydia coinfection is present. $#(Choice D)#  Vulvovaginal candidiasis is typically due to Candida albicans, which causes vaginal pruritus, labial erythema, and a white, curd-like discharge.  KOH examination shows yeast forms and pseudohyphae.  Treatment is with azole antifungals (eg, fluconazole), which block ergosterol synthesis. $#(Choice E)#  Syphilis causes a painless chancre (not vaginal discharge), followed by a rash and systemic symptoms; it is caused by the gram-negative spirochete Treponema pallidum.  It is treated with penicillin, a bactericidal beta-lactam antibiotic that inhibits cell wall synthesis. $#Educational objective# Bacterial vaginosis causes a thin, gray or clear, malodorous discharge from overgrowth of anaerobes (eg, Gardnerella vaginalis) and a loss of lactobacilli in the vaginal flora.  Diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of clue cells and a positive amine whiff test with potassium hydroxide.  Treatment is with clindamycin or metronidazole.  "

The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (the time required for erythrocytes to settle from suspension) is an indirect measure of positive APRs. $• #Negative APRs# (serum levels fall in acute inflammatory states) include albumin, transferrin, and transthyretin (prealbumin). $#Procalcitonin#, a precursor of calcitonin produced by monocytes and the C cells of the thyroid, is a unique APR that has positive and negative properties.

This patient has lobar pneumonia manifesting with fever, rust-colored sputum, and neutrophil-predominant leukocytosis, likely due to a bacterial infection (eg, Streptococcus pneumoniae).  Therefore, procalcitonin levels are expected to be elevated. $#(Choice A)#  B-type natriuretic peptide is secreted by the ventricles in response to elevated ventricular filling pressure, which is seen in decompensated heart failure.  Patients with heart failure often have elevated jugular venous pressure and lower extremity edema, pulmonary examination findings are usually bilateral, and fevers and leukocytosis would not be expected. $#(Choice B)#  Cold agglutinins (ie, IgM against erythrocyte I antigen) are nonspecific but often seen in patients with Mycoplasma pneumoniae.  However, patients with M pneumoniae typically present with a dry cough and pharyngitis, and laboratory results demonstrate a mild hemolytic anemia with a normal leukocyte count.  When pneumonia occurs due to M pneumoniae, examination findings are characteristically scattered and bilateral. $#(Choices C and E)#  Prealbumin (transthyretin) and transferrin are negative APRs and would be decreased in this acutely ill patient.  Prealbumin levels are also decreased in cases of malnutrition and may be helpful in evaluation of nutritional status.  Transferrin is also used to determine iron status. $#Educational objective# Acute phase reactants (APRs) are proteins whose serum concentrations change by ≥25% during periods of inflammation.

Korea, Taiwan, Mozambique, and China experience the highest annual rates of HCC (36 per 100,000 versus <5 per 100,000 in North America).  The individuals who develop HCC in these countries usually have chronic HBV infection acquired through vertical transmission at childbirth, which increases their risk of developing HCC by early to middle adulthood 200-fold.  In the United States, HCC normally arises after the age of 60.  In these countries with high rates of HBV infection, however, HCC commonly presents in adults 20 to 40 years old. $Therefore, universal vaccination of children against HBV would be the one measure most likely to cause a steep decline in the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide. $#(Choice A)#  Improved water sanitation would be of significant help in reducing the incidence of many foodborne illnesses transmitted through the fecal-oral route (such as hepatitis A). $#(Choice B)#  Vitamin supplementation would be of significant help in reducing the incidence of conditions associated with poor nutrition (eg, pellagra). $#(Choice D)#  Adequate antibiotic usage would be of significant help in reducing the length and severity of bacterial infections. $#(Choices E and F)#  Routine physician check-ups and wider access to hospital care would be of significant help in educating the patient population, identifying disease processes in early stages, and reducing suffering. $#Educational objective# Universal vaccination of children against HBV would likely cause a steep decline in the worldwide incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma.

  "explanation_2": "$#Schistosomiasis# is a parasitic blood fluke infection endemic to rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and South America.  Transmission occurs when humans #bathe in freshwater# ponds, lakes, or rivers contaminated with cercariae from #infected snails#.  Cercariae penetrate the dermis and travel to the liver, where they evolve into adult worms and subsequently migrate into the venules in the walls of the intestines, colon, or bladder. $Because adult schistosomes absorb host proteins and display host antigens on their surface, they are relatively protected from immune recognition and generally do not cause symptoms.  However, adult worms shed #eggs# into the circulation that travel through host tissues and induce #eosinophilic granulomatous inflammation# and fibrosis (as seen in the image above).  This can lead to indolent symptoms in the liver, spleen, bowel wall, and genitourinary system.  One characteristic manifestation of genitourinary schistosomiasis is the development of hematuria at the end of voiding #('terminal hematuria')# due to bladder wall inflammation and ulcers; urinary calcifications, obstruction, and bladder cancer may eventually develop. $#(Choice A)#  Benign prostatic hyperplasia can cause chronic urinary tract obstruction.  Patients usually have difficulty voiding urine (eg, slow stream, hesitancy), frequency, urgency, and/or nocturia. $#(Choice C)#  Cyclophosphamide is a common cause of hemorrhagic cystitis in patients undergoing chemotherapy for cancer or chronic rheumatologic conditions.  Cystoscopy may show bladder irritation, but eggs would not be seen on biopsy. $#(Choice D)#  Cigarette smoking is a major risk factor for the development of bladder cancer (usually transitional cell carcinoma), which classically presents with painless hematuria.  However, cystoscopy generally shows a mass, and @biopsy@ would reveal malignant cells, not eggs. $#(Choice E)#  Genitourinary infections with bacteria that split urea such as Proteus mirabilis are frequently associated with the formation of urinary stones.  Nephrolithiasis can cause hematuria but is usually very painful. $#Educational objective# Schistosomiasis is a parasitic blood fluke infection that is associated with bathing in freshwater contaminated with cercariae from infected snails.  Patients often are asymptomatic for months or years but may eventually develop eosinophilic granulomatous inflammation in the liver, spleen, gastrointestinal tract, or genitourinary system.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient sustained a puncture wound and subsequently developed #inflammatory lymphadenopathy# in a draining lymph node, suggesting bacterial infection with lymphadenitis.  Lymph nodes serve as sentinel sites for generation of the #adaptive immune response#.  Large, unprocessed foreign antigens are displayed by #follicular dendritic cells# in the draining lymph node.  B cells recognize, bind to, and process the large antigens into smaller peptides that can be displayed on major histocompatibility II receptors to naïve T cells.  T cells subsequently differentiate into T-helper cells and secrete cytokines that promote the survival and proliferation of the antigen-specific B cells, leading to the generation of #germinal centers#. $Germinal centers are the sites where #B cells# compete for survival based upon the ability to bind with high affinity to a foreign antigen.  Within these regions, B cells rapidly #proliferate #and undergo #somatic hypermutation# (immunoglobulin mutation); this dramatically expands the B cell population capable of binding with high affinity to antigens from the infecting microorganism.  Antigen-specific B cells eventually evolve into plasma cells that secrete high affinity antibodies against the invading pathogen. $Because the formation of germinal centers results in significant cellular recruitment, patients generally develop lymph node swelling (#lymphadenopathy#) in the draining lymph node.  In addition, the release of large quantities of cytokines frequently causes #pain and inflammation# in that area. $#(Choice A)#  Atypical B-cell proliferation is seen in many forms of lymphoma.  However, the lymphadenopathy is usually painless and not associated with erythema because B-cell proliferation without antigen stimulation is not associated with significant inflammatory cytokine release. $#(Choice B)#  Granulomatous lymphadenitis can be seen in noninfectious (eg, sarcoidosis) or infectious (eg, tularemia, catscratch disease, cryptococcal) diseases.  This patient with a recent puncture wound in the foot and evidence of inflammatory lymphadenopathy in a draining lymph node is far more likely to have a typical bacterial infection than an atypical granulomatous infection. $#(Choice C)#  Necrotizing lymphadenitis (eg, buboes) in the groin can be caused by certain serovars of Chlamydia trachomatis.  However, this infection is typically seen in tropical and subtropical regions and would not be associated with a recent foot puncture wound. $#(Choice D)#  T cells primarily reside in the lymph node paracortex.  Paracortical hyperplasia is typically seen with infections primarily dependent on the cell-mediated response (eg, viral infection).  Although the paracortical region might expand slightly in bacterial infections, lymphadenopathy is primarily driven by the formation of germinal centers. $#Educational objective# Germinal centers are the sites where activated B cells proliferate and undergo affinity maturation during generation of a humoral immune response.  The formation of multiple germinal centers is typically marked by lymphadenopathy, pain, and inflammation in the affected lymph node due to cellular recruitment and the release of inflammatory cytokines.

Management of acute attacks involves supportive care and the administration of C1INH concentrate or a kallikrein inhibitor. $#(Choice A)#  Increased antinuclear antibody (ANA) titers are seen in a number of autoimmune conditions, including systemic lupus erythematosus, which is associated with hypocomplementemia but would have different clinical manifestations (eg, butterfly rash, arthritis, oral ulcers).  ANA production is not a result of excessive C1 activity. $#(Choice B)#  Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is associated with increased antistreptolysin O titers, complement activation, and low levels of C3.  The typical presentation is hematuria or nephritic syndrome following respiratory infection. $#(Choice D)#  Complement-mediated intravascular hemolysis can result from autoantibodies (autoimmune hemolytic anemia) or from direct complement activation (paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria); however, neither condition results from excessive C1 activity. $#(Choice E)#  Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which are associated with idiopathic angioedema, function by blocking ACE and result in increased renin levels.  ACE also degrades bradykinin. $#Educational objective# C1 inhibitor (C1INH) deficiency causes increased cleavage of C2 and C4 and results in inappropriate activation of the complement cascade.  C1INH also blocks kallikrein-induced conversion of kininogen to bradykinin, a potent vasodilator associated with angioedema.  ",

Therefore, patients diagnosed with any of these cancers require comprehensive evaluation and continued surveillance of the at-risk area (eg, colonoscopy, comprehensive skin examination, panendoscopy of the upper aerodigestive tract). $#(Choice A)#  Chemotherapy can induce secondary malignancies, most commonly leukemia and lymphoma, in cancer survivors.  In contrast to the tumors in this patient, secondary malignancies are seen years or even decades later. $#(Choices C and F)#  Most carcinomas, including HNSCC, spread via the lymphatic system, leading to metastases in the regional (eg, ipsilateral anterior neck) lymph nodes.  However, it is unlikely for the carcinoma to spread back up to a contralateral epithelial site.  Hematogenous spread is less common with carcinomas and typically results in metastases to distant sites. $#(Choice D)#  Certain anatomic sites (eg, eyes, testes) display inherent immune privilege, in which foreign grafts or cancers that would otherwise induce immunologic rejection are tolerated.  Cancers may establish local sites of immune privilege to evade destruction, but this does not cause new tumor formation. $#(Choice E)#  Cancer treatment (eg, chemotherapy, radiation therapy) can result in impaired wound healing, which can result in acutely ulcerative oral lesions due to mucositis.

DR is a result of chronic hyperglycemic injury to the small retinal vessels and is considered a #microangiopathic# complication of diabetes (along with neuropathy and nephropathy).  The prevalence of DR is proportionate to the duration of diabetes and severity of hyperglycemia over time; tight control of diabetes is associated with a lower long-term risk of DR. $DR is categorized as follows: $• #Nonproliferative# (early disease):  The earliest morphologic changes include thickening of the basement membrane and failure of the blood-retinal barrier.  Increased permeability allows leakage of fluid into the retina (macular edema), which can distort vision and leave behind lipid-rich deposits (hard exudates).  Arteriolar obstruction causes ischemic injury to the retina, which manifests as @cotton-wool spots@.  Other findings include @microaneurysms@ and dot-blot hemorrhages (due to microaneurysm rupture). $• #Proliferative# (advanced disease):  Progressive retinal ischemia stimulates production of angiogenic factors (eg, vascular endothelial growth factor), leading to formation of new retinal vessels (#neovascularization#).

The rings are formed through the granular deposition of copper within Descemet's membrane in the cornea. $Wilson's disease is a rare, autosomal recessive disease most often identified in individuals 5-40 years old.  The genetic mutations associated with Wilson's disease hinder copper metabolism by reducing the formation and secretion of ceruloplasmin and decreasing hepatic secretion of copper into the biliary system.

  "explanation_2": "$This infant born at 29 weeks gestation has #abnormal retinal vascularization# extending into the vitreous, findings diagnostic of #retinopathy of prematurity# (ROP).  This condition, exclusive to premature neonates, is a leading cause of severe visual impairment and blindness. $In utero, the relatively low oxygen tension normally causes upregulation of proangiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF); these growth factors stimulate normal vessel growth.  Premature birth disrupts this process as follows: $• The relatively #hyperoxic environment# (even in room air) after delivery leads to #downregulation# of #VEGF# and slowing or #arrest of retinal vascular growth#. $• Once the retina begins to mature (over subsequent weeks), increased metabolic demand causes relative retinal hypoxia, which again stimulates VEGF.  This often results in #aberrant# new vessel formation (#neovascularization#), which can lead to retinal scarring and/or detachment if severe. $Although prematurity alone can lead to ROP, the risk is increased in premature neonates with significantly #elevated arterial oxygen tension# because hyperoxia #exacerbates# the initial VEGF suppression and increases risk of subsequent aberrant neovascularization.  In this case, the patient had neonatal respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen, which likely contributed to disrupted retinal angiogenesis. $#(Choice A)#  Corticosteroids are often administered to women in preterm labor to induce surfactant production by the fetal lungs and decrease the risk or severity of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome.  This therapy is not associated with neonatal retinal neovascularization. $#(Choice B)#  Terbutaline is a beta agonist used to delay preterm labor and delivery by suppressing uterine contractions.  Fetal risks include tachycardia and hypoglycemia (due to maternal hyperglycemia causing fetal hyperinsulinism), not ROP. $#(Choice C)#  Neonatal ophthalmic antibiotic treatment (ie, erythromycin) prevents gonococcal conjunctivitis and can cause chemical conjunctivitis in rare cases; however, retinal changes would not occur. $#(Choice E)#  Exogenous surfactant decreases alveolar surface tension and alveolar collapse (ie, atelectasis), improving ventilation/perfusion mismatch.  This therapy allows for supplementation of oxygen at decreased concentrations, which helps prevent ROP. $#Educational objective# The pathogenesis of retinopathy of prematurity involves an initial downregulation of proangiogenic factors (eg, VEGF) due to hyperoxia following delivery.  Subsequently, increased metabolic demand causes relative retinal hypoxia, which stimulates a pathological increase in VEGF leading to aberrant vessel formation.  Neonatal oxygen supplementation increases the risk in premature infants.  "

The endometrium is subdivided into the stratum functionalis and stratum basalis.

However, they are not evident immediately after birth because the neonates have frequent glucose resupply (from frequent breastfeeding) and, therefore, do not depend on the breakdown of glycogen. $#(Choice E)#  Fetal hyperglycemia can result in increased secretion (not impaired production) of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2), causing macrosomia. $#(Choice F)#  Insulin promotes glucose storage in the liver as glycogen; therefore, infants of mothers with poorly controlled diabetes have increased glycogen stores.  However, despite hypoglycemia, these infants have poor mobilization of glycogen (glycogenolysis) due to islet hyperplasia and the resultant hyperinsulinemia. $#Educational objective# Neonates born to mothers with poorly controlled diabetes during pregnancy are exposed to high maternal glucose levels in utero, resulting in beta cell hyperplasia followed by excessive fetal insulin production.

The absence of an intact decidual layer and subsequent direct placental attachment to the myometrium makes for a difficult placental delivery.

Unlike placenta accreta, abruptio placentae causes antepartum bleeding and promotes, rather than delays, placental detachment. $#(Choice C)#  Uterine atony (ie, poor uterine contractility) is the most common cause of PPH and typically presents with a soft, boggy uterine fundus.  This patient's firm uterine fundus and unresponsiveness to uterotonic medications (which contract the uterus) make this diagnosis less likely. $#(Choice D)#  Intraamniotic infection can cause vaginal bleeding and an inflamed, adherent placenta.

In addition, this patient has no fever or purulent amniotic fluid, making this diagnosis unlikely. $#Educational objective# Placenta accreta spectrum occurs due to placental invasion into the myometrium through defects in the decidua basalis.

This patient requires evaluation for primary associated neoplasms before screening for metastases. $#(Choice C)#  Colonoscopy is performed in patients with an inherited predisposition to colorectal cancer, such as those with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (ie, Lynch syndrome) and familial adenomatous polyposis.  VHL disease is not associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer in younger patients. $#(Choice D)#  Screening echocardiography is performed in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex to identify an associated cardiac rhabdomyoma.  Cardiac tumors are not a significant feature of VHL disease. $#Educational objective# Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an autosomal dominant condition caused by a mutation in a tumor suppressor gene, which is associated with the development of pheochromocytomas, retinal and cerebellar hemangioblastomas, and renal cell carcinomas.  Because of the potential for serious complications from these tumors, patients with VHL should receive annual surveillance, including plasma metanephrines, abdominal imaging, ophthalmologic examination, and MRI of the brain and spine.

  "explanation_2": "This patient with an ovarian mass, hirsutism (eg, coarse facial hair), and voice deepening likely has a #Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor#, an ovarian sex cord–stromal tumor.  Ovarian tumors can be associated with increased hormonal or enzymatic activity based on their cell composition.  Sertoli and Leydig cells are normally found in the male testes but can develop in the ovaries and produce #excess testosterone#.  With proliferation of these cells, male-range testosterone levels can occur and cause signs of hyperandrogenism.  Therefore, patients typically present with: $• #Frank virilization#:  Testosterone excess can cause #hirsutism# and #clitoromegaly#, as seen in this patient.  Additional features may include male pattern (bitemporal) baldness, #voice deepening#, and increased muscle mass. $• Anovulation and amenorrhea:  Elevated testosterone levels suppress hypothalamic GnRH and pituitary FSH/LH release.  Therefore, patients may develop signs of anovulation such as abnormal uterine bleeding or #amenorrhea#. $Diagnosis is supported by markedly elevated serum testosterone levels, but surgical removal is needed for definitive histologic diagnosis. $#(Choices A and B)#  Dysgerminomas and endodermal sinus (yolk sac) tumors are both malignant ovarian germ cell tumors with hormonal activity.  Dysgerminomas secrete β-hCG and lactate dehydrogenase; yolk sac tumors secrete alpha-fetoprotein.  Because they do not secrete testosterone, neither tumor type is associated with rapid-onset virilization. $#(Choice C)#  Granulosa cell tumors are sex cord–stromal tumors that secrete estrogen and inhibin.  Patients typically have signs of excessive estrogen (eg, breast tenderness, abnormal uterine bleeding due to endometrial hyperplasia) rather than signs of excess testosterone. $#(Choice D)#  Mature cystic teratomas (dermoid cysts) are the most common benign germ cell tumor and are typically composed of several differentiated tissues (eg, hair, sebaceous glands) arising from the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm.  Most mature cystic teratomas do not produce hormones.  The exception is struma ovarii, a monodermal teratoma mostly composed of thyroid tissue that can secrete thyroid hormone and cause signs of hyperthyroidism (eg, tachycardia, weight loss). $#(Choice E)#  Serous cystadenocarcinomas are the most common epithelial ovarian cancer but typically have no hormonal or enzymatic activity. $#Educational objective# Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors of the ovary arise from the sex cord stroma and secrete testosterone.  Therefore, patients typically have signs and symptoms of hyperandrogenism, including rapid-onset virilization (eg, hirsutism, clitoromegaly, voice deepening) and amenorrhea.  "

  "explanation_2": "This patient with abnormal uterine bleeding and bulk symptoms (eg, bloating, pelvic pressure) had a midline pelvic mass similar to that caused by uterine leiomyomas (ie, fibroids).  However, uterine fibroids tend to regress rather than enlarge as patients approach menopause (median age 51).  In this patient, who was increasingly symptomatic and at increased risk due to #tamoxifen use#, the most concerning potential diagnosis is #uterine sarcoma#, a rare but #aggressive malignant tumor# arising from the #uterine myometrium# or endometrial connective tissue. $Because uterine sarcomas and leiomyomas often have overlapping clinical presentations and imaging findings, microscopic evaluation is required to differentiate between the two: $• Leiomyomas (uterine fibroids) are benign tumors of the uterine myometrium caused by monoclonal proliferation of myocytes and fibroblasts.  Therefore, microscopy shows no nuclear atypia and a minimal number of mitotic figures #(choice D)#. $• In contrast, uterine sarcomas are rapidly progressive malignant tumors.  Therefore, microscopy shows myocytes and/or endometrial stromal cells with #nuclear atypia#, #abundant mitoses#, and areas of necrosis. $Treatment for uterine sarcoma is hysterectomy followed in some cases with chemotherapy and/or pelvic radiation. $#(Choice A)#  Adenomyosis, the invagination of endometrial tissue into the myometrium, commonly presents with heavy menstrual bleeding and an enlarged uterus due to increased endometrial surface area.  However, microscopy typically reveals endometrial glands embedded in the myometrium. $#(Choice B)#  Cervical cancer classically presents with abnormal vaginal bleeding (eg, postcoital bleeding).  Although cervical cancer can cause nuclear atypia with numerous mitoses, these abnormal changes occur in cervical squamocolumnar epithelial cells, not the myometrium. $#(Choice C)#  Chronic endometritis may present with abnormal uterine bleeding; however, it does not cause a large or immobile pelvic mass.  Microscopy typically shows plasma cells within the endometrial stroma, not the myometrium. $#Educational objective# Uterine sarcoma is a rare but aggressive malignant tumor of the uterine myometrium and/or endometrial stromal tissue.  Patients typically have clinical features similar to those with uterine leiomyomas (eg, abnormal uterine bleeding, immobile pelvic mass), but uterine sarcoma can be distinguished by microscopy, which typically shows characteristic malignant features such as nuclear atypia, abundant mitoses, and tumor necrosis.

Therefore, risk factors for high-grade cervical dysplasia are related to either high rates of HPV acquisition or immunosuppression (eg, HIV, organ transplant) that reduces the rate of infection clearance. $HPV is typically sexually transmitted; therefore, cervical dysplasia is more common in patients with prior sexually transmitted infections, #multiple or high-risk sexual partners#, and lack of barrier contraception use.  In addition, those with #impaired cellular immunity# (eg, HIV coinfection) cannot mount an effective immune response against HPV due to T-cell deficiency, which leads to persistent infection and increased oncogenicity.  Early initiation and sustained adherence to antiretroviral therapy can reduce the risk for progression to cervical cancer in patients with HIV. $#(Choice A)#  Women with early coitarche (eg, initial sexual intercourse at age <18) have twice the risk for cervical cancer compared to women with coitarche after age 21.

  "explanation_2": "This patient with dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia likely has #endometriosis#, the presence of #ectopic endometrial glands and stroma# in an @extrauterine location@ (eg, peritoneal cavity).  Risk factors include nulliparity, early menarche, and prolonged menses; in contrast, multiparity and late menarche lower the risk due to fewer menstrual cycles (ie, fewer opportunities for retrograde menstruation). $Like the uterine endometrium, ectopic endometrium undergoes periods of proliferation and breakdown concordant with the @menstrual cycle@.  Although patients typically have #regular menstrual cycles# (eg, every 26 days, lasting 5 days), shedding from ectopic endometrial glands can form intraperitoneal blood collections, leading to #dysmenorrhea#.  Over time, the blood undergoes hemolysis and induces #pelvic inflammation# followed by #adhesion formation#, which, in turn, distorts pelvic organ anatomy and function. $Pelvic inflammation and adhesions can cause #infertility# by interfering with ovulation, preventing fertilization by sperm, and inhibiting implantation.  Tissue adhesions involving the uterosacral ligaments can also cause a fixed, @retroverted uterus@.  In addition, nodular implants within the posterior cul-de-sac can lead to #painful intercourse# and tenderness with palpation of the posterior vaginal fornix. $#(Choice B)#  Estrogen deficiency (eg, primary ovarian insufficiency, menopause) can cause glycogen deficiency in the vaginal epithelium and flattening of the vaginal rugae, which contribute to dyspareunia.  However, this patient's regular menses indicate normal estrogen levels. $#(Choice C)#  Endometrial hyperplasia increases the endometrial gland/stroma ratio because the primary risk factor, excess estrogen stimulation, preferentially stimulates glandular proliferation.  In contrast to this patient with endometriosis, those with endometrial hyperplasia typically have irregular, anovulatory menses. $#(Choice D)#  Multiple ovarian follicular cysts with cortical fibrosis occur in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).  Although PCOS can cause infertility due to anovulation, it is typically associated with obesity, hyperandrogenism (eg, hirsutism, acne), and oligomenorrhea.  This patient's regular menses make this etiology unlikely. $#(Choice E)#  @Adenomyosis@ is the abnormal presence and proliferation of endometrial glands within the uterine myometrium.  Although adenomyosis can cause dysmenorrhea, patients typically have heavy menses and a symmetrically enlarged uterus, which are not seen in this patient. $#Educational objective# Endometriosis is the presence of endometrial glands and stroma in an extrauterine location.  Ectopic implants within the intraperitoneal cavity degenerate during menses and can cause abdominopelvic inflammation and the formation of tissue adhesions.  Therefore, patients with endometriosis may have dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and infertility.  ",

  "explanation_2": "Breast enlargement in adolescent boys, or #gynecomastia#, is often physiologic during puberty.  However, a #pathologic# cause should be suspected when the onset is outside of midpuberty (eg, Tanner 1 or 5), the tissue is rapidly enlarging, or other abnormalities on physical examination suggest a systemic disorder.  In this case, the patient is age 17 but has #small/firm testes#, a sign of #hypogonadism#.  His learning disability and tall height make @Klinefelter syndrome@, the most common cause of primary hypogonadism, the most likely diagnosis. $Patients with Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY karyotype) typically have atrophied, hyalinized seminiferous tubules, resulting in low inhibin levels, and damaged Leydig cells, resulting in #low testosterone# levels.  The lack of @feedback inhibition@ results in excess gonadotropin production (ie, #increased FSH and LH#).  Elevated FSH #upregulates aromatase#, the enzyme that converts androgens into estrogens, and therefore causes increased estradiol levels #(choice A)#.  The increase in the estrogen/testosterone ratio is responsible for breast tissue growth. $Other phenotypic findings in patients with Klinefelter syndrome include #tall stature# and absent secondary sex characteristics (eg, deep voice, facial/pubic hair).  Cognitive impairment is typical and characterized by #learning disabilities# and impaired social skills. $#(Choice B)#  Increased androstenedione levels due to anabolic steroid use can cause irreversible gynecomastia and testicular atrophy.  However, exogenous steroids would also cause acne, male pattern baldness, and aggressive behavior, none of which are seen in this patient.  In addition, hastened epiphyseal closure (ie, reduced height potential) is characteristic with adolescent steroid use. $#(Choice C)#  Testicular germ cell tumors produce excessive β-hCG, which can result in gynecomastia.  However, a rapidly growing testicular mass, not small, firm testes, would be present on examination. $#(Choice E)#  Hyperprolactinemia due to a prolactinoma can result in gynecomastia; high prolactin suppresses GnRH, which leads to reduced LH and testosterone secretion.  However, this diagnosis is uncommon and often delayed in male patients, usually resulting in associated neurologic findings (eg, headache, vision changes) due to local tumor growth.  In addition, hyperprolactinemia is not associated with learning disabilities or tall stature. $#Educational objective# Pathologic gynecomastia should be suspected in patients who also have signs of hypogonadism (eg, small/firm testes, absent pubic hair).  Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY) is the most common cause of primary hypogonadism, and patients have low testosterone, elevated gonadotropin (FSH, LH), and relatively increased estradiol levels. ",

Undescended testes may be unilateral (more common) or bilateral and can lie anywhere along the path from the abdomen to the scrotum. $Complications of cryptorchidism include the following: $• #Infertility#:  Because the seminiferous tubules and #Sertoli cells# are #temperature sensitive# and prone to heat damage, the lower body temperature inside the scrotum is ideal for sperm production.  Testicles located outside of the scrotum are at risk for atrophy and necrosis of the seminiferous tubules, resulting in reduced quality and quantity of sperm and decreased fertility.  Orchiopexy (surgical fixation of the testes in the scrotum) before age 1 helps preserve fertility potential. $• #Malignancy#:  Patients with a history of cryptorchidism are at increased risk for a testicular germ cell tumor (eg, #seminoma#).  Although orchiopexy decreases the rate of malignant transformation, the #risk remains higher# than that of the general population #despite surgery#.  However, fixation of the testis in the scrotum does enable easier detection of testicular masses on examination. $#(Choice A)#  Unlike the seminiferous tubules, the testosterone-producing Leydig cells are not sensitive to temperature, so testosterone levels and virilization are usually normal in patients with cryptorchidism. $#(Choice B)#  Leydig cell tumors are rare, non–germ cell testicular tumors that are not associated with cryptorchidism. $#(Choice D)#  Testicular torsion occurs more frequently in an undescended testicle compared to one in the normal scrotal position; however, the risk is minimal following surgical fixation of the testis. $#(Choice E)#  A varicocele is typically a chronic, benign dilation of pampiniform plexus veins but can occur secondary to venous obstruction from an abdominal mass or thrombus.
