This presentation is classic for #Kaposi sarcoma# (KS), the most common tumor in HIV-positive individuals, which usually presents as @multiple red, purple, or brown papules@ or plaques and appears first on the #lower extremities# before spreading proximally. $KS is a vascular tumor that is strongly associated with both HIV and #human herpesvirus type 8# (HHV-8).  HHV-8 #infects# vascular and lymphatic #endothelial cells#, causing them to differentiate into a mixed phenotype thought to #increase oncogenic potential#.  The HHV-8 genome contains several viral oncogenes that inhibit cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, thereby promoting endothelial cell growth and tumorigenesis.  @Biopsy@ of cutaneous KS typically reveals a dermal proliferation of spindle-shaped endothelial cells with slit-like vascular spaces, red blood cell extravasation, and inflammation. $#(Choice A)#  @Basal cell carcinomas@ arise from basal keratinocytes, typically due to ultraviolet radiationâ€“induced mutations.  Lesions are commonly pink or skin-colored (vs violaceous), pearly or translucent, and located in sun-exposed areas such as the face (vs the thigh). $#(Choice C)#  Cutaneous mastocytosis is caused by the pathologic accumulation of mast cells within the skin, which, in adults, is often associated with systemic mast cell proliferation (ie, systemic mastocytosis).  Skin involvement typically manifests as monomorphic, reddish-brown macules that gradually proliferate and spread over months to years; because of histamine release, the lesions characteristically develop erythema or urticaria when scratched. $#(Choice D)#  @Sweet syndrome@ (ie, acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) is a rare inflammatory disorder associated with pathologic neutrophilic infiltration into the skin.  Because of their inflammatory nature, lesions are typically erythematous, edematous, and tender; ulceration like that of pyoderma gangrenosum (another neutrophilic disease of the skin) may occur.  Lesions are classically accompanied by frequent fever. $#(Choice E)#  Melanocytic nevi are caused by the benign proliferation of nevus cells, a type of melanocyte that forms clusters instead of single units evenly dispersed throughout the skin.  @Acquired melanocytic nevi@ may be elliptical, raised, and nontender; however, they are not typically violaceous, and most appear in childhood or adolescence (vs adulthood). $#Educational objective# Kaposi sarcoma often presents as multiple red, purple, or brown lesions on the lower extremities in patients with HIV infection.

      "explanation_2": "$This patient has numerous @cutaneous neurofibromas@ (fleshy skin nodules) and cafÃ©-au-lait macules (flat, uniformly pigmented lesions), likely due to #neurofibromatosis type 1#, an autosomal dominant disorder (eg, her biological family members are also affected) associated with a mutation in the neurofibromin gene (NF1). $Cutaneous neurofibromas are #benign nerve sheath tumors# composed of diverse cells and are often found #within the dermis#.  The dermis, the connective tissue layer between the epidermis and subcutaneous tissue (ie, hypodermis), is composed of collagen, elastic fibers, and ground substance and contains extracellular components including nerves, vasculature, hair follicles, and glands.  @Neurofibromas@ are composed of a mixture of cells normally found in peripheral nerves, including #neoplastic Schwann cells#, as well as non-neoplastic fibroblasts, perineural cells, and mast cells. $Cutaneous neurofibromas most commonly appear around puberty and increase in size and number with age.  CafÃ©-au-lait macules represent localized areas of increased melanogenesis rather than pathologic cellular proliferation. $#(Choice A)#  Numerous cutaneous tumors, both benign and malignant, can arise from the adnexal structures of the skin: hair follicles (eg, pilomatricomas), sebaceous glands (eg, sebaceous adenomas), and sweat glands (eg, poromas).  Some cutaneous adnexal tumors present as skin-colored papules or nodules; however, they are typically not as diffuse as this patient's skin lesions and are not associated with numerous cafÃ©-au-lait macules. $#(Choice C)#  Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is characterized by a proliferation of atypical keratinocytes arising from the epidermis and invading the dermis.  These lesions often present as discrete nodules with a @scaly@ or @ulcerated@ surface.  In contrast, this patient's multiple lesions have normal overlying epidermis.  In addition, although the epidermis contains free nerve endings, these unencapsulated neuronal receptors lack the components (eg, Schwann cells, connective tissue) that typically give rise to neurofibromas. $#(Choice D)#  Superficial fibromatosis represents an infiltrative fibroblast proliferation within superficial fascia, which can lead to progressive fascial contracture and local deformity.  A classic example is @Dupuytren contracture@ (ie, palmar fibromatosis), which affects the palmar fascia. $#(Choice E)#  Most skeletal muscle neoplasms are malignant.  @Rhabdomyosarcomas@ are aggressive tumors that arise from primitive mesenchymal cells with skeletal muscle differentiation rather than from mature, terminally differentiated muscle cells.  They often appear during childhood or adolescence and involve locations that do not contain much skeletal muscle, most commonly the sinuses and genitourinary tract. $#Educational objective# Neurofibromas are benign nerve sheath tumors composed of cells normally found in peripheral nerves, including neoplastic Schwann cells, as well as non-neoplastic fibroblasts, perineural cells, and mast cells.  Cutaneous neurofibromas often arise from small nerves in the dermis. ",

It is strongly associated with celiac disease, and histopathology shows microabscesses at the dermal papillary tips, which coalesce to form subepidermal blisters. $#(Choice C)#  Erythema nodosum is characterized by painful, red nodules on the shins and often represents an inflammatory response to medications (eg, oral contraceptives), infections, inflammatory bowel disease, or sarcoidosis.  Histopathology is variable but typically shows a septal panniculitis with a mixed cellular infiltrate. $#(Choice E)#  Urticaria (\"hives\") is a transient dermatologic disorder that is caused by antigen-induced degranulation of focal mast cells through IgE antibody sensitization.  This degranulation causes microvasculature hyperpermeability and the formation of wheals that typically surface and resolve within hours. $#Educational objective# Psoriasis is characterized by hyperkeratosis and confluent parakeratosis of the stratum corneum, and epidermal hyperplasia (acanthosis) with elongated rete ridges.

Pathogen-specific #cytotoxic T-cells# then recognize foreign antigens produced by keratinocytes and initiate an inflammatory cascade that results in epithelial damage. $Manifestations of EM include #target-shaped lesions# on the extremities and trunk that have a @central dusky area@, a surrounding pale ring of edema, and a peripheral halo of erythema.

BI is a superficial infection by Staphylococcus aureus that is most common in young children.  It is spread by direct contact, with the greatest incidence in warm, humid, crowded environments.  Nonbullous @impetigo@ is a similar syndrome with pustules and crusting but without significant blistering.  Either form may occur in healthy skin (primary impetigo) or broken/inflamed skin (secondary impetigo). $The blistering in BI is caused by production of #exfoliative toxin A#, a serine protease that targets #desmoglein 1# in the superficial epidermis, by certain strains of S aureus.  Desmoglein is a cadherin component of desmosomes in epidermal cellular junctions; disruption by exfoliative toxin A causes a #loss of cell adhesion# and leads to formation of flaccid bullae. $Exfoliative toxin A is also responsible for staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, which presents with generalized erythema and flaccid bullae in flexural areas. $#(Choices A and B)#  @Bullous pemphigoid@ is an autoimmune disorder associated with antibodies against hemidesmosomes and is characterized by tense, subepidermal blisters.  @Pemphigus vulgaris@ is characterized by intraepithelial cleavage and is due to autoantibodies against desmosomes (desmogleins 1 and 3); it presents with flaccid bullae, desquamation, and oral ulcerations.

The proliferative phase# begins 3-5 days after the injury.  Fibroblasts and endothelial vascular cells proliferate to form connective tissue and blood vessels (neovascularization), respectively.

TGF-Î² is also critical for stimulating connective tissue synthesis and remodeling of the extracellular matrix.  TGF-Î² typically decreases during the maturation phase of wound healing to limit the amount of collagenous scar tissue.  Hypertrophic or disfiguring scars can be caused by persistently elevated TGF-Î², which leads to increased fibroblast proliferation and activity.

Melanomas are composed of melanocytes, which have the function of pigmentation.  Because 'pigmentation' is not among the answer choices, glomus tumor is the most likely diagnosis. $A glomangioma is a tumor of the modified smooth muscle cells of a glomus body.  Glomus bodies are numerous small, encapsulated neurovascular organs found in the dermis of the nail bed, the pads of the fingers and toes, and the ears.  Each glomus body is composed of an afferent arteriole connected to a richly innervated, muscular arteriovenous anastomosis, which is then connected to an efferent vein.  Modified smooth muscle cells are arranged in layers around these vascular channels.  The role of the glomus body is to shunt blood away from the skin surface in cold temperatures in order to prevent heat loss, and to direct blood flow to the skin surface in hot environments to facilitate the dissipation of heat. $#(Choice A)#  Extremity receptors responsible for proprioception include muscle spindles, Golgi tendon organs, Pacinian corpuscles, and cutaneous touch receptors (including Meissner's corpuscles, Merkel's disks, and free nerve endings).  A tumor of any component of these structures (e.g. neurons, connective tissue cells) would not have a bluish coloration. $#(Choice B)#  Light touch is mediated by cutaneous mechanoreceptors, which may be encapsulated or free nerve endings. # #A tumor of these structures would not have a blue hue. $#(Choice D)#  A lymphangioma is a tumor of the cells involved in lymphatic drainage.

Because they do not contain pigmented cells or red blood cells, lymphangiomas would be unlikely to have a bluish appearance. $#(Choice E)#  A tumor of antigen-processing cells would be either a histiocytosis or a lymphoma.  When there is cutaneous involvement in Langerhans cell histiocytosis, patients present with erythematous papules, nodules, and/or scaling plaques.  B-cell lymphomas very rarely involve the skin. $#(Choice F)#  The basal epidermal cells of the nail matrix are responsible for nail growth.  Tumors originating from the epidermis include squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) and basal cell carcinomas (BCC).  SCC does not involve pigmented cells.  Although BCC may involve pigmented cells, the majority of these lesions (85%) appear on the head and neck; BCC rarely affects the dorsum of the hands. $#Educational objective# A benign glomus tumor (glomangioma) can produce a very tender, small (a few millimeters in diameter), red-blue lesion under the nail bed.  This type of tumor originates from the modified smooth muscle cells that control the thermoregulatory functions of dermal glomus bodies.  "

      "explanation_2": "$#Malignant melanoma# most often arises in the skin, although it may occur wherever there are pigmented cells, such as the eye and the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract.  Sunlight exposure appears to be an important factor in the pathogenesis of dermal melanoma, as are hereditary factors and a history of preexistent dysplastic nevi.  Light-skinned individuals are at greatest risk. $On gross inspection, @melanomas@ are characterized by asymmetric shape, irregular or jagged border, variability of color (brown, black, red, blue, or unpigmented), diameter >0.5 cm, and evolution in size and appearance over time (#ABCDE criteria#).  Histologically, @melanoma cells@ congregate in poorly formed nests and are large with irregular nuclei, clumped chromatin, and prominent nucleoli. $In early development, many melanomas exhibit a radial growth phase.  This superficial, horizontal growth within the epidermis and superficial dermis carries a very low risk of metastatic spread #(choice A)#.  In contrast, melanomas in the #vertical growth phase# contain melanoma cells that travel downward into the deeper dermal layers, #increasing metastatic risk#.  Vertical growth often corresponds to a palpable nodularity of the lesion.  The #Breslow depth# (distance from the epidermal granular cell layer to the deepest visible melanoma cells) is the most important prognostic indicator in malignant melanoma. $#(Choice C)#  A dense lymphocytic infiltration of the tumor suggests a robust immune response and is thought to improve prognosis. $#(Choice D)#  Multinucleated giant melanocytes are a characteristic finding in lentigo maligna melanoma.  @Lentigo maligna@ are common pigmented lesions in elderly patients and are considered to be a type of melanoma in-situ.  When melanoma develops in lentigo maligna, the prognosis is similar to other melanomas of the same stage. $#(Choice E)#  Prominent cellular atypia is a classic finding of malignant melanoma, but it is not considered the most important risk factor for metastatic disease. $#Educational objective# Melanoma often has an early horizontal growth phase with low metastatic potential followed by a nodular, vertical growth phase with a significantly increased risk of metastasis.  Depth of invasion (Breslow thickness) is the most important prognostic indicator in malignant melanoma.  ",

Hair products, including dye, frequently contain allergenic molecules (eg, p-phenylenediamine) that can cause #allergic contact dermatitis# (ACD).  ACD is a @type IV hypersensitivity@ (delayed-type) reaction that occurs in 2 phases:  $1. #Sensitization:#  Cutaneous #Langerhans cells# take up haptens (small molecules that bind to proteins and alter their immune appearance) and present hapten-peptide complexes to naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in regional lymph nodes, resulting in clonal expansion of hapten-sensitive T cells.  This phase takes #10-14 days# and does not result in cutaneous lesions.  $2. #Elicitation:#  On reexposure to the hapten, sensitized T cells are recruited to skin for activation by hapten-protein conjugates displayed on cutaneous antigen-presenting cells.  Activated #CD8+ T cells#, the main effector cells in ACD, release cytotoxins (eg, perforin, granzymes) and express Fas ligand to induce keratinocyte apoptosis.  They also amplify the inflammatory response by releasing cytokines (eg, #interferon gamma#) and recruiting additional inflammatory cells (eg, macrophages).  This phase occurs #2-3 days# following reexposure to the hapten and results in erythema, pruritus, and vesicles. $#(Choice B)#  Mast cells are primarily responsible for immediate (@type I@) hypersensitivity reactions.  On reexposure, allergens bind to allergen-specific IgEs on mast cells, causing immediate degranulation and release of vasoactive peptides (eg, histamine), resulting in @urticaria@ and, when severe, anaphylaxis.  Onset is rapid (minutes), unlike this patient's delayed (48-hr) response.  Furthermore, individual wheals of urticaria resolve within 24 hours, rather than days. $#(Choice C)#  Neutrophils phagocytose bacteria and fungi and kill them by generating reactive oxygen species (NADPH oxidase) and hypochlorous acid (myeloperoxidase).  Although neutrophils play a role in defense against cutaneous infections (eg, cellulitis, which is painful rather than pruritic), this patient's rash is more consistent with contact dermatitis. $#(Choice D)#  Immunoglobulins produced by plasma cells are responsible for @type II and III@ hypersensitivity reactions.  ACD does not involve plasma cells or antibodies. $#(Choice E)#  Regulatory T cells are CD4+ lymphocytes that play an inhibitory role in the immune response.  They secrete cytokines (eg, interleukin-10) that inhibit macrophage function and antagonize proinflammatory cytokines (eg, interferon gamma).  This anti-inflammatory effect is important in suppressing autoimmune diseases. $#Educational objective# Allergic contact dermatitis is a type IV (delayed-type) hypersensitivity reaction.  Initially, Langerhans cells present haptens to naive T cells, leading to clonal expansion.  On reexposure, sensitized CD8+ T cells are recruited to skin and destroy tissue.  Release of interferon gamma by T cells further amplifies the immune response. ",

Pieces of these proteins #(neoantigens)# are displayed on MHC class I molecules on the cell surface and are subsequently recognized by #cytotoxic T cells# as \"nonself\" (leading to cellular apoptosis).  However, neoplastic cells generally accumulate genetic mutations that allow them to thwart the cytotoxic T-cell response and evade detection/destruction.  One common mechanism is the overexpression of #programmed death-ligand 1# (PD-L1) on the cancer cell surface; this ligand binds to the PD-1 receptor on cytotoxic T cells and suppresses their ability to induce apoptosis (#T-cell exhaustion#). $Treatment with monoclonal antibodies that block PD-1 such as #pembrolizumab# have shown promise in cancers that overexpress PD-L1 (eg, #melanoma#, renal cell carcinoma).  #Blockade of PD-1# restores the cytotoxic T-cell response (disinhibition), which #promotes tumor cell apoptosis#.  Patients with advanced melanoma and other susceptible malignancies often have a drastic clinical response (eg, tumor regression, long-term remission) to PD-1 antagonists. $#(Choices A and E)#  Cancer-related inflammation also involves cells of the innate immune system such as macrophages and neutrophils.  These cells can have either protumor (eg, release of matrix metalloproteases that facilitate invasion) and antitumor (eg, direct killing of cancer cells) activities depending on the local cytokine milieu.  However, PD-1 inhibitors do not increase the antitumor activity of neutrophils or macrophages. $#(Choice B)#  Tumor cells often induce desmoplasia, which refers to excessive connective tissue/stroma growth around the tumor.  A strong desmoplastic response can reduce the ability of chemotherapeutic agents to penetrate into the tumor, leading to chemoresistance. $#(Choice C)#  Angiogenesis inhibitors (eg, bevacizumab) are used to prevent neovascularization of growing tumors, leading to ischemia and tumor necrosis.  PD-1 inhibitors cause cytotoxic T-cell activation, leading to increased apoptosis of tumor cells; they do not induce ischemic necrosis. $#Educational objective# Programmed-death receptor 1 (PD-1) is a checkpoint inhibitor that downregulates the cytotoxic T-cell response.  Neoplastic cells often exploit this receptor via the overexpression of PD-1 ligand.  PD-1 receptor inhibitors (eg, Pembrolizumab) restore the T-cell response, allowing cytotoxic T cells to invade the tumor and induce apoptosis of neoplastic cells.  "

Androgenetic alopecia is characterized by a shortened @anagen hair growth phase@ in the affected portions of the scalp, leading to shorter, thinner hair shafts #(follicular miniaturization)# with increased apoptosis at the dermal papillae. $As the name implies, androgenetic alopecia is driven by both inherited (polygenic inheritance) and hormonal factors.  #Dihydrotestosterone# (DHT) appears to be the primary androgen responsible for hair loss.  Although total androgen levels are similar in affected and unaffected men, patients with androgenetic alopecia have a greater effect of DHT due to increased local conversion of testosterone to DHT and increased concentrations of androgen receptors in affected areas of the scalp. $Androgenetic alopecia can be treated with @5-alpha reductase inhibitors@ (eg, #finasteride#), which #decrease #conversion of testosterone to #DHT #in the tissues.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient most likely has #atopic dermatitis# (eczema), an #inflammatory# condition that begins in infancy or early childhood.  Pathogenesis involves genetically mediated skin barrier dysfunction (eg, filaggrin mutation) and a dysregulated immune response that favors IgE production, mast cell and eosinophil activation, and overproduction of Th2 cytokines. $Loss of epidermal water content, increased permeability to allergens/irritants, and inflammation result in dry skin, intense pruritus, erythema, and, sometimes, weeping and crusting (as seen in this patient).  Distribution typically includes the face and the flexural areas of the @elbows@ and knees in children. $First-line treatment of atopic dermatitis is topical corticosteroids.  However, due to concerns for corticosteroid-induced atrophy in areas with thin skin (eg, face, neck, axilla, groin), second-line therapy with #calcineurin inhibitors# (eg, tacrolimus, pimecrolimus) can be used instead.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient's rash that resolved with use of a barrier ointment was likely #irritant contact diaper dermatitis#, the most #common# diaper rash in infants.  Characteristic features include erythematous papules confined within the diaper area.  In contrast to @candidal diaper dermatitis@, another common diaper rash caused by a secondary yeast infection, irritant contact diaper dermatitis does not have skinfold involvement or satellite lesions (ie, discrete lesions beyond the borders of the main rash). $Irritant contact diaper dermatitis is predominantly caused by #skin barrier breakdown# from exposure to urine and stool trapped within the diaper.  Patients with frequent stooling (eg, diarrhea) are at increased risk because urease produced by #fecal bacteria# causes an #increase in local skin pH#, which allows for activation of proteolytic enzymes that disrupt the stratum corneum.  Areas of macerated skin are then prone to frictional damage from the diaper, which further exacerbates the rash. $The #treatment# for irritant contact diaper dermatitis is a thick #barrier ointment# (eg, petrolatum) or paste (eg, zinc oxide), which provides the skin an adherent layer of protection from contact with the stool and urine.  Other measures to reduce irritant exposure include frequent diaper changes and diaper-free periods. $#(Choice A)#  Abnormal keratin expression describes the pathogenesis of psoriasis, which manifests as erythematous, scaly plaques.  Psoriasis rarely presents in the diaper area and is usually chronic and persistent without topical corticosteroid treatment. $#(Choice C)#  Increased hapten sensitization describes allergic contact dermatitis, which is uncommon in the diaper area but can occur with an allergy to a component (eg, dye, fragrance) in diapers or wipes.  The rash is unlikely to resolve without complete removal of the offending antigen (eg, changing diaper brand), and topical corticosteroids are also required in many cases. $#(Choice D)#  Local bacterial colonization with Staphylococcus or Streptococcus leads to impetigo in the diaper area.  Honey-crusted pustules are classic, and topical antibiotics are the first-line treatment. $#(Choice E)#  Scabies is a mite infestation that causes itchy, erythematous papules.  The rash can involve the diaper area, but lesions would also be expected elsewhere (eg, axillae, hands, feet).  Treatment is with permethrin, and resolution would not be expected with petrolatum alone. $#Educational objective# Irritant contact diaper dermatitis is the most common diaper rash and is characterized by skin barrier breakdown as a result of exposure to fecal bacteria that causes increased local skin pH.  Treatment is with a barrier ointment that prevents skin contact with urine and stool.  ",

Raising of the lesion above the surrounding skin (tissue overgrowth) is further consistent with excessive proliferation of granulation tissue (ie, @hypergranulation tissue@) at the site of wound healing. $Granulation tissue is an essential component of the proliferative phase of normal wound healing, providing the nutrients and structure needed for a wound to fill and reepithelialize.  Platelets and macrophages in and around a healing wound produce vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which induces the vascular and fibroblast proliferation of granulation tissue. $However, if #VEGF-induced tissue proliferation# continues unchecked, the resulting hypergranulation tissue prevents wound epithelialization and remodeling.  These lesions most often occur at the site of nasogastric tubes or wounds left to #heal by secondary intention# (ie, the wound is purposely left open). $#(Choice A)#  Cutaneous amyloidosis is caused by the deposition of insoluble fibers derived from precursor proteins (eg, immunoglobulin light chains) into the superficial dermis.  It can have a varied gross appearance (eg, macular, nodular, lichenous) but would be characterized histologically by homogenous, @eosinophilic dermal deposits@. $#(Choice B)#  During the remodeling phase of wound healing, fibroblasts and type III collagen in granulation tissue are gradually (ie, over weeks to years) replaced with myofibroblasts and type I collagen, forming a scar.

  "explanation_2": "$This patient's red papules and pustules on the face are consistent with #inflammatory acne#.  The pathogenesis of acne involves the following: $â€¢ #Hyperkeratinization# due to abnormal epithelial growth and differentiation of corneocytes leads to keratin plug formation in the pilosebaceous follicles.  These blocked follicles are referred to as comedones (ie, @whiteheads@ and @blackheads@). $â€¢ In response to #androgen stimulation# (eg, during pubertal adrenarche), #sebaceous glands# enlarge (not involute) and increase production of sebum, a lipid-rich substance that facilitates obstruction of pilosebaceous follicles #(choice A).# $â€¢ #Cutibacterium acnes#, an anaerobic bacteria that relies on sebum as a nutrient source, proliferates in occluded follicles, triggering an #inflammatory response# that results in the red papules and pustules characteristic of @nodulocystic acne@. $#(Choice B)#  Bacterial metabolism of apocrine secretions contributes to body odor.  Bromhidrosis is a condition characterized by excessive and offensive body odor. $#(Choice C)#  Estrogen has antiandrogenic effects and inhibits sebum production.  For this reason, estrogen-containing oral contraceptives help to improve inflammatory acne. $#(Choice D)#  As epithelial stem cells undergo mitosis in the basal layers of the epidermis, newer cells form and undergo differentiation as they migrate toward the surface, replacing epithelial cells that desquamate.  Increased epithelial mitosis and desquamation (ie, topical retinoids) helps extrude debris from comedones, limiting acne formation. $#Educational objective# Acne is characterized by the obstruction of pilosebaceous follicles (ie, comedones) due to hyperkeratinization and excessive sebum accumulation.  Androgens stimulate production of sebum, which serves as a nutrient source for Cutibacterium acnes.  Within the follicles, C acnes proliferation triggers an inflammatory response, resulting in formation of red papules and pustules.  ",

Although less common, fomite transmission (eg, clothing) can also occur because mites survive 2-3 days off the skin. $#(Choice A)#  @Folliculitis@ from exposure to water contaminated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa presents as tender, pruritic papules or pustules on exposed areas, and symptoms typically self-resolve within 2 weeks.  This patient's rash duration and distribution make this diagnosis unlikely. $#(Choice B)#  Incomplete vaccination against varicella-zoster virus (VZV) increases the risk for chickenpox, which presents with fever (not seen here) followed by a pruritic, vesicular rash.  Lesions are not common on the soles, and the rash typically crusts over and resolves in 1-2 weeks.  VZV reactivation can present as @herpes zoster@, which may begin as erythematous papules but are typically painful and limited to a single dermatome. $#(Choice C)#  Hiking in wooded areas increases the risk for poison ivy exposure or tick-borne diseases (eg, Lyme disease).  Although contact dermatitis due to @poison ivy@ causes an intensely pruritic rash, lesions are often linear (where the plant touched the skin) and on exposed surfaces.  In addition, the rash typically resolves within 2-3 weeks.  Lyme disease causes @erythema migrans@, an expanding macular rash not seen in this patient. $#(Choice E)#  Syphilis, which causes a painless genital ulcer, spreads via sexual contact, and manifestations of @secondary syphilis@ include a maculopapular rash involving the palms and soles.  Unlike this case, however, most patients also have constitutional symptoms (eg, fever) and lymphadenopathy. $#Educational objective# Scabies causes an intensely pruritic, papular rash involving the hands, feet, and genitalia.

Transmission occurs from prolonged skin-to-skin contact with an infected individual but may occasionally occur due to contact with contaminated fomites (eg, bedsheets, clothing).  Mites #burrow under the epidermis# and evoke a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to mite feces and eggs, which leads to an intensely #pruritic rash#.  The mites can often be seen on microscopy. $Classic scabies is associated with a mild mite burden (10-15 mites).  Patients usually have several small erythematous @papules@ on the sides/webs of the fingers, wrists, elbows, axillae, waist, and genitalia.  #Excoriations# and #burrows# (thin, serpiginous red tracks) may be seen.  In contrast, patients with impaired cell-mediated immunity (eg, #HIV#) are unable to contain the infection and usually develop @crusted scabies@, which is associated with thousands or #millions of mites#.  These patients often have mild pruritus (because the inflammatory response is muted) and several erythematous patches with scaling and crusting. $Treatment is required to prevent discomfort, transmission, and potential complications (eg, secondary bacterial infection).  First-line therapy includes #topical permethrin#, which blocks mite neurotransmission by impairing voltage-gated sodium channels.  Oral #ivermectin#, an antiparasitic agent that binds chloride ion channels in invertebrate nerve and muscle cells, is an alternate medication for classic scabies that is used in combination with permethrin for crusted scabies. $#(Choice A)#  Oral acyclovir is used for human @herpes simplex virus@ outbreaks, which are usually characterized by vesicular lesions on an erythematous base.  The orolabial mucosa and genital area are affected most commonly.  Histopathology would show epidermal blisters with acantholysis and multinucleated cells. $#(Choice B)#  Oral terbinafine can be used for patients with dermatophytic infections of the skin.  Dermatophytes often cause an erythematous scaly rash and erosions.  Microscopy typically reveals fungal spores and/or hyphae. $#(Choice C)#  @Psoriasis@ is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that can be treated with topical glucocorticoids.  It is usually associated with symmetric, @sharply defined@ skin plaques with overlying scales on the extensor elbows, knees, and scalp.  Microscopy generally shows uniform epidermal hyperplasia, parakeratosis, dilated capillaries in the papillary dermis, and perivascular lymphocytes. $#(Choice D)#  Topical mupirocin is used for the treatment of impetigo, a superficial bacterial infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes.  The condition typically presents as a localized papulovesicular rash with surrounding erythema and adherent golden crusts involving the face or extremities. $#Educational objective# Scabies is a human mite infection associated with a pruritic papular rash with excoriations and burrows.

  "explanation_2": "This patient has a vesicular rash consistent with #herpes zoster# (shingles), which is caused by @reactivation@ of latent varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection.  Following the primary infection (#chickenpox#), VZV remains dormant in the #dorsal root ganglia# until emerging decades later.  Decreased cell-mediated immunity (eg, older age, immunosuppressive medications, HIV infection) increases the risk of reactivation. $Reactivation of VZV causes hemorrhagic inflammation of the dorsal root ganglion and peripheral nerve.  The resulting hypersensitive nerve function presents with #neuropathic pain# in the affected region (herpetic neuralgia), typically described as stabbing, tingling, or burning.  Herpetic neuralgia can begin even before the appearance of skin lesions and may persist for up to several months.  A minority of patients experience #long-term residual pain#, termed #postherpetic neuralgia#; the risk is greater in older patients (age >70) and those with more severe shingles. $#(Choice A)#  Primary VZV infection is characterized by a diffuse vesicular rash (chickenpox), but reactivation is dermatomal.  Generalized reactivation or spread to other body areas can occur in immune-compromised patients but is extremely rare in healthy individuals. $#(Choice B)#  Reactive arthritis presents with an asymmetric peripheral oligoarthritis, often with extraarticular symptoms (eg, uveitis, conjunctivitis, urethritis).  It typically follows bacterial gastrointestinal (eg, Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter) or genitourinary (eg, Chlamydia) infection. $#(Choice D)#  IgA nephropathy produces recurrent glomerulonephritis and typically presents with episodic hematuria.  Common triggers include upper respiratory illness, but shingles does not typically exacerbate the condition. $#(Choice E)#  Toxic or metabolic nerve injury (eg, diabetic peripheral neuropathy) is typically proportionate to the length of the sensory nerve fibers.  Symptoms appear first in the longest nerves, such as those to the feet and hands, causing a \"glove and stocking\" distribution.  However, because reactivation of VZV occurs only in specific sensory ganglia, symptoms have a dermatomal distribution. $#Educational objective# A unilateral vesicular rash localized on a single dermatome in an older patient is most likely herpes zoster.  Postherpetic neuralgia is the most common neurologic complication of varicella zoster virus infection.  ",

  "explanation_2": "This patient, who developed a serpiginous, pruritic rash shortly after walking barefoot on a beach, likely has #hookworm infection#.  Hookworms spread when #egg-containing feces# are deposited into shady, warm, moist sand or soil.  Eggs hatch into larvae and are transmitted when they come into #direct contact with human skin# (eg, when walking barefoot). $Dermal penetration is usually marked by a #pruritic maculopapular lesion# (\"ground itch\") at the site of larval entry (eg, foot, toe webs).  Spread of larvae through the adjacent dermal tissue can lead to the formation of migrating, reddish-brown, #serpiginous tracks#.  Deeper spread may occur, depending on the species of infecting hookworm, as follows: $â€¢ @Human hookworms@ (eg, Necator americanus, A duodenale) penetrate the basement membrane and spread from the dermis to the bloodstream.  They rupture into the alveoli and are coughed up and swallowed into the small intestine.  There, larvae mature into adult hookworms that feed on blood from the duodenal mucosa (often causing iron deficiency anemia) and shed up to 10,000 eggs/day, thereby spreading the infection to others. $â€¢ Cat and dog hookworms (eg, Ancylostoma braziliense, A caninum) cause a dermal eruption in humans but are unable to penetrate the cutaneous basement membrane and spread to deeper tissues.  Therefore, larvae do not mature into adult hookworms or spread from human-to-human (humans are incidental hosts). $#(Choice A)#  A brown recluse spider bite usually appears as a red plaque or papule with central pallor; it may develop a dark central eschar that ulcerates due to necrosis.  Pain is often severe. $#(Choice C)#  Mycobacterium marinum lesions usually form a few weeks after exposure to contaminated fresh/salt water (eg, swimming pool, fish tank).  Lesions begin as solitary papules or nodules that eventually ulcerate and scar.  Serpiginous tracts would be uncommon. $#(Choice D)#  Sporothrix schenckii, a dimorphic fungus, is usually transmitted when contaminated organic material (eg, moss, soil) is inoculated into the skin or subcutaneous tissue.  A papule forms at the inoculation site and usually ulcerates; additional lesions form along the proximal route of lymphatic drainage. $#(Choice E)#  Staphylococcus aureus is the most common cause of purulent cellulitis.  Lesions tend to develop over days and are characterized by painful areas of fluctuance with surrounding erythema. $#(Choice F)#  Vibrio vulnificus is a free-living bacterium that grows in brackish water and marine environments.  It can contaminate wounds and cause mild cellulitis.  More severe manifestations (eg, myositis, necrotizing fasciitis, sepsis) can develop in patients with certain underlying comorbidities (eg, liver disease, hemochromatosis). $#Educational objective# Hookworm infections are transmitted via direct contact between human skin and contaminated soil/sand (eg, walking barefoot).

With neutropenia (typically ANC <500/mm3), there is increased susceptibility to bacterial infections.  The dermatologic lesions in this patient are consistent with #ecthyma gangrenosum# (EG), which is strongly associated with #Pseudomonas aeruginosa# bacteremia. $#Perivascular bacterial invasion# of arteries and veins in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue, with subsequent release of exotoxins destructive to human tissue, leads to characteristic #skin patches# exhibiting #necrosis and ulceration# as a result of insufficient blood flow.  P aeruginosa virulence factors that may contribute to EG include exotoxin A (protein synthesis inhibition), elastase (degrades elastin - important for blood vessel destruction), phospholipase C (degrades cellular membranes), and pyocyanin (generates reactive oxygen species). $Although gram-negative sepsis is sometimes associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and resultant purpuric skin lesions, DIC is unlikely given the normal platelet count and coagulation times (prothrombin and activated thromboplastin times). $#(Choice A)#  Escherichia coli is not associated with EG.

This progresses to purpuric discoloration, bullae formation, and sensory loss due to tissue necrosis. $#Educational objective# Ecthyma gangrenosum is a cutaneous necrotic disease with a strong association with Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremia.  It occurs from perivascular invasion and release of tissue-destructive exotoxins, causing vascular destruction and insufficient blood flow to patches of skin that become edematous and subsequently necrose.  Pseudomonas infections are common in patients who are neutropenic, are hospitalized, have burns, or have indwelling catheters.  ",

They are associated with a rare but highly malignant form of skin cancer known as Merkel cell carcinoma. $#(Choice D)#  Melanocytes are pigment producing cells of the epidermis that arise from the neural crest cells and migrate to the basal layer of the epidermis during embryogenesis.  They possess dendritic processes that intercalate between the remaining cells of the epidermis and facilitate the delivery of pigment-laden melanosomes from the melanocyte to the keratinocytes. $#(Choices E and F)#  Macrophages can be found in the skin, possess myeloid cell surface markers, and when stimulated, are able to produce dendrite-like extensions of their cytoplasm.  Macrophages can also differentiate into multinucleated (Langhans) giant cells and epithelioid cells in the setting of granulomatous inflammation. However, monocytes and their derivatives do not produce Birbeck granules. $#Educational objective# Langerhans cells are dendritic cells found in the skin that act as professional antigen presenting cells.  These cells are derived from the myeloid cell line and they possess characteristic racquet-shaped intracytoplasmic granules known as Birbeck granules.  "

  "explanation_2": "$This patient sustained a large flank #abrasion# that healed by secondary intention (ie, from the base upward).  This process, which occurred over 3 weeks, involved the formation of well-vascularized connective tissue (ie, granulation tissue) at the wound base and resurfacing of the wound with new epithelium (ie, reepithelialization). $Reepithelialization is triggered when injury to the skin disrupts most or all of the layers of the @epidermis@, resulting in #loss of keratinocyte-to-keratinocyte contact#.  Contact with other keratinocytes typically limits cell division and/or motility (ie, contact inhibition).  However, when this contact is lost due to injury, keratinocytes are #stimulated to replicate# and migrate until a continuous epithelial layer is restored. $From the wound edges, keratinocytes #migrate across# newly formed #granulation tissue# at the wound base and are replenished via replication of basal keratinocytes in the stratum basale.  This process continues until keratinocytes meet other keratinocytes (ie, #contact inhibition#), corresponding with #completion of reepithelization# (eg, wound covered in pearly pink epithelium).  At this point, proliferation and migration signals cease, and the stratification process begins. $#(Choice A)#  During the proliferation phase of wound healing, transforming growth factor-beta induces some fibroblasts to differentiate into myofibroblasts that produce intracellular contractile proteins (eg, actin, myosin).  Myofibroblast contraction helps decrease the size of the wound. $#(Choice C)#  Melanocytes are melanin-producing cells that reside within the stratum basale.  They are derived from neural crest cells and are distinct from basal cells (ie, keratinocyte stem cells).  Failure of melanocytes to migrate into a healing scar can lead to permanent scar hypopigmentation. $#(Choice D)#  Several immune cells, including neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells, are responsible for pathogen phagocytosis during the inflammatory phase of wound healing.  Macrophages are of particular importance for clearing foreign bodies and cellular debris (eg, apoptotic neutrophils). $#Educational objective# Keratinocytes are responsible for wound reepithelization.  They migrate into the wound from its edges and are repopulated by replication within the stratum basale.  Keratinocytes continue to migrate and proliferate until they contact other similar cells, a regulatory mechanism known as contact inhibition.  ",

  "explanation_2": "This patient has chronic #allergic contact dermatitis# (ACD), presenting with localized itching and @lichenification@ (ie, skin thickening).  #Nickel# is a common trigger and typically causes symptoms at the wrists (eg, watches), earlobes (eg, earrings), or umbilicus (eg, belt buckles).  Corrosion of metal alloys by electrolytes in sweat releases soluble metal ions that trigger a hypersensitivity reaction.  ACD is a type IV (#delayed-type#) hypersensitivity reaction occurring in 2 phases:  $1. #Sensitization:#  Cutaneous Langerhans cells take up haptens (ie, allergens) and present them to naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in regional lymph nodes, resulting in clonal expansion of hapten-sensitive T cells.  This phase takes 10-14 days and does not result in cutaneous lesions.  $2. #Elicitation:#  On reexposure, sensitized T cells are recruited to the dermis.  There, they release cytokines (eg, interferon gamma) that recruit additional inflammatory cells (eg, macrophages, mast cells, eosinophils), resulting in erythema and pruritus.  Dermal #edema#, caused by leaky dermal vessels, seeps into the #epidermal# intercellular spaces (@spongiosis@), pulling apart intercellular attachments and sometimes resulting in @intraepidermal vesicles@.  With persistent exposure, the lesions become thickened and less vesicular; histopathology shows epidermal hyperplasia (ie, @acanthosis@). $#(Choice A)#  Extravasated erythrocytes, siderophages, and perivascular lymphocytes are characteristic of venous stasis dermatitis, which typically occurs at the lower extremities and presents with @brown discoloration@ (hemosiderin deposition). $#(Choice B)#  Hyperkeratosis and sawtoothed rete ridges are characteristic of @lichen planus@, which presents as small pruritic, purplish, polygonal @papules@ or plaques.  It frequently occurs at the volar wrist but is typically multifocal; a large, localized plaque is atypical. $#(Choice D)#  In @pemphigus vulgaris@, autoantibodies against desmosomes lead to loss of intercellular adhesion (ie, acantholysis) and intraepithelial cleavages that manifest as @flaccid bullae@.  Unlike ACD, pemphigus vulgaris may show a sparse inflammatory infiltrate; loss of intercellular adhesion is caused by autoantibodies, not edema. $#(Choice E)#  Neutrophilic microabscesses and epidermal hyperplasia (ie, acanthosis) are characteristic of @psoriasis@, which presents as erythematous plaques with @thick scales@ typically on the extensor, not flexor, surfaces of the extremities.  Although epidermal hyperplasia is seen in chronic ACD, neutrophilic microabscesses are not expected. $#Educational objective# Allergic contact dermatitis (eg, nickel allergy) is a type IV hypersensitivity reaction characterized by epidermal intercellular edema (ie, spongiosis) and an inflammatory infiltrate (eg, lymphocytes, eosinophils).  Clinical findings can include vesicles, erythema, and pruritus for acute lesions and lichenification for chronic lesions.  ",
